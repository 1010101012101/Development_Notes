<i>Anduino revisions</i>
</p>

<p>
The Anduino is a pretty streightforward clone of a <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9218">Sparkfun Arduino Pro Mini</a> and Ed Baafi's <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/content/projects/fabkit/">Fabkit</a>. Just as Ed did, since there is no 8/16Mhz oscillator in the fab inventory, I used the internal oscillator.
</p>

<p>
I felt compelled to put together an Arduino clone because I have been developing quite a few shields recently, and needed a clone to prototype with. The Anduino is fully "shield compatible" (except for ARef). 
</p>

<p>
For 5V in there is a two pin 0.1" header and a mini-B USB connector (because I have been powering projects recently with USB chargers). I removed the copper from around the Vin pins so you can graft a right angle header there if needed. On many of my prototypes, I didn't install the 5V regulator, choosing instead to power it with only the USB connector.
</p>

<h2>Errata</h2>

<p>
There are some errata, and will reproduce the list of errata here for my notes (and I expect some of the problems to not be resolved)
</p>

<ul>
    <li> <strike>No ICSP header</strike> See the ICSP shield below</li>
    <li> No USB Serial converter - requires use of FTDI cable (I'll probably add a different version with a ATMega16U2 like the UNO)</li> 
    <li> <strike>RX and TX swapped</strike> Fixed</li>
    <li> AREF not connected</li>
    <li> <strike>Reset requires jumper wire</strike> Yea...</li>
    <li> <strike>Vin voltage regulator is only 150mA, should probably be 500mA</strike> now has pads for both types of regulators</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strike>None of those errata are show stoppers except for RX/TX swapped. This will be fixed in a near future revision.</strike> Fixed.
</p>

<h2>Programming</h2>

<i>ICSP Shield</i>
</p>

<p>
I built an ICSP shield to program the board with the FabISPkey (and to work around the lack of an ICSP header).
</p>

<p>
To use the Arduino environment with my Anduino, I followed <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/content/projects/fabkit/">Ed's</a> notes - particularly those for OSX.
</p>

<p>
First, I placed a board description file <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/content/projects/anduino/boards.txt">boards.txt</a> in <code>~/Documents/Arduino/hardware/anduino/boards.txt</code>
</p>

<p>
Then, I selected my board from the list of boards, and used my <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/content/projects/elec/index.html">FabISPkey</a> to program it (select USBTinyISP).
</p>

<p>
<strike>Then, with the RX and TX pins swapped</strike> (fixed) connect a FTDI cable, and program normally.
</p>

<h2>Headers</h2>

<table cellspacing="30" align="center">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img src="header0.jpg" width="300" border="1"></td>
<td><img src="header1.jpg" width="300" border="1"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
It's kinda difficult to find headers that you can surface mount like this, I used <a href="http://parts.digikey.com/1/parts/339460-conn-rcpt-50pos-100-sngl-horz-bcs-150-l-s-he.html">these</a> and heavily modified them.
</p>

<p>
Better choices for these headers might be:
</p>

<ul>
    <li> <a href="http://search.digikey.com/us/en/products/PPPC061LGBN-RC/S5481-ND/775939">6 Position</a>
    </li><li> <a href="http://search.digikey.com/us/en/products/PPPC081LGBN-RC/S5483-ND/775941">8 Position</a>
</li></ul>

<p>
They're pass through headers, so I aligned them by putting a header through the holes, then surface mounting the headers as the photos above show.
