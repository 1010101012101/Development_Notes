        <p>For this week's assignment I modified the <a href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/embedded_programming/hello.ftdi.44.png">Hello World PCB</a> to have an RGB led and a button.  I did all my electronics design in EagleCAD.</p>
        <p>First I threw the <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.14/tutorials/electronics_design/fab.lbr">fab.lbr</a> file into my <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/eagle-tutorial-how-to-add-a-new-package-to-a-component/new-library">Eagle/lbr folder</a>.  Then in the control panel I told eagle to use the fab.lbr library according to <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-install-and-setup-eagle/using-the-sparkfun-libraries">these</a> instructions.</p>
        <p><img src="img1.jpg"></p>
        <p>I started the board by inserting all the components from the original Hello World PCB into my schematic editor.  I used a combination of wires and nets to make the board more legible.</p>
        <p><img src="img2.jpg"></p>
        <p>I used the <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/using-eagle-schematic/tips-and-tricks">show tool</a> to verify that all my connections were set correctly in the eagle schematic editor. </p>
        <p>Next I switched to board layout and laid out my components roughly the same way that they are in the <a href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/embedded_programming/hello.ftdi.44.png">sample schematic</a>.  <br> </p>
        <p><img src="img3.jpg"></p>
        <p>I found a bunch of <a href="http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/CLV1A-FKB-CJ1M1F1BB7R4S3/CLV1A-FKB-CJ1M1F1BB7R4S3TR-ND/1987471">these</a> common anode RGB LEDs in the CBA shop (datasheet <a href="http://www.cree.com/~/media/Files/Cree/LED%20Components%20and%20Modules/HB/Data%20Sheets/CLV1AFKB(874).pdf">here</a>).  The forward current for the R, G, and B leds was 50, 25, and 25mA, respectively and the forward voltage was 2.0, 3.2, and 3.2V.  I placed one RGB led and three current limiting resistors in the schematic so that they could be controlled by pins B2, A2, and A3.  I also wired up a button and a pull down resistor to pin A7.</p>
        <p><img src="img4.jpg"></p>
        <p>I followed <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/using-eagle-board-layout">Sparkfun's instructions</a> to create by board layout in eagle.  I downloaded the <a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.14/tutorials/electronics_design/fablab_17mils.dru">fablab_17mils.dru</a> design rules file and loaded it into Eagle.  It checks to make sure that my design is mill-able on the modela with at least 17mil spacing in between all traces.  I <a href="http://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/eagle-autorouter/">set my default net class</a> to have 12mil traces with 18 mil clearance before running the autorouter.  After autorouting, I only had three traces left to route manually. </p>
        <p><img src="img5.jpg"></p>
        <p>For the manual routing, I held down the alt key to get eagle to snap components to a finer grid- allowing for more precise placement.  I used two zero ohm resistors to avoid collisions with existing traces.  I wasn't sure exactly how to handle this in Eagle, I didn't want the zero ohm resistors in my schematic, so I added them but didn't connect them to anything with nets.  If you look closely, you will see airwires going across them in the image below.</p>
        <p><img src="img6.jpg"></p>
        <p>To get the schematic ready for export I deselected all layers except the top layer:</p>
        <p><img src="img7.jpg">
            <img src="img8.jpg"></p>
        <p>I exported the schematic (File&gt;&gt;Export) as a png at 500 dpi.</p>
        <p><img src="img9.jpg">
            <img src="img10.jpg"></p>
        <p>I used Photoshop to generate the board outline.</p>
        <p><img src="img11.jpg"></p>
        <p>Milling the PCB went without incident.  I used the Modela in the CBA shop connected to the compiled fab modules.  </p>
        <p><img src="img12.jpg"></p>
        <p>One small problem I had was that the corners of my board outline were not milled, so I had to use a shard blade to score and snap the board out.  If I'd made my board outline a little thicker, this probably would not have happened.</p>
        <p><img src="img13.jpg"></p>
        <p>I populated the board according to the values set in my schematic.  One small change I made was to use 100Ohm resistors instead of 220Ohm for the LEDs, because I could not find any 220 - this should be fine and keep all the LEDs well within their limits.  I also made a 6 pin jumper cable for programming my board.</p>
        <p><img src="img14.jpg">
            <img src="img15.jpg"></p>
        <p>I used <a href="http://highlowtech.org/?p=1695">High Low Tech's tutorial</a> to get my board programmed.  Starting with the blink sketch provided by Arduino, I changed the led pin number to 2 to blink the red LED, 3 to blink the blue LED, and 8 to blink the green LED.  One thing I noticed was that I had to change the delay to 10 ms to get it to blink at a decent rate - I think delay() might be relying on timers that the attiny doesn't have, causing it to behave strangely/slowly.  </p>
        <p>Then I wrote a really simple sketch that turned on the red LED when the button was pressed to be sure the button was working.  Here is the important logic in that sketch:</p>
        <pre>currentButtonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);
digitalWrite(redLED, !currentButtonState);</pre><p>Then I wrote a sketch that allows the button to put the LED into several modes.  This sketch uses software button debouncing to turn the momentary button into a 6 state toggle switch.</p>

</pre><p>When wiring, I didn't want to mess with any of the pins connected to data because I was worried it would interfere with programming the board.  This meant that my LED was only hooked up to one of the 4 PWM pins on the attiny (stupidly, I connected the button to one of them because I didn't plan things out that well). When I have more time, I'd like to dive into <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/PortManipulation">port/pin manipulation</a> and timer interrupts for the attiny to see if I could get a nice fade effect through software. All this info can be found in the <a href="http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc8006.pdf">datasheet</a>.</p>
