SWUpdate supports local and remote updates, multiple update strategies and it can be well integrated in the Yocto build system by adding the meta-swupdate layer. It supports the common media on embedded devices such as as NOR / NAND flashes, UBI volumes, SD / eMMC, and can be easy extended to introduce project specific update procedures. Pre- and postinstall scripts are supported, and a LUA interpreter helps to customize the update process. An update package is described by the sw-description file, using the libconfig syntax or JSON. It is even possible to use LUA with a custom syntax. Here a short list of the main features: Install on embedded media (eMMC, SD, Raw NAND, NOR and SPI-NOR flashes) Allow delivery single image for multiple devices Multiple interfaces for getting software local storage integrated web server integrated REST client connector to hawkBit remote server download Software delivered as images, gzipped tarball, etc. Allow custom handlers for installing FPGA firmware, microcontroller firmware via custom protocols. Power-Off safe Hardware / Software compatibility.

I'm proposing a method using Buildroot and an initramfs such that you can simply drop a few files from a .zip onto a normal, FAT-formatted SD card to perform the extraction. There are several things really handy here, such as the ability to edit autorun.sh to be whatever script you want to run on your board at boot. In the archive, I only have the necessary autorun.sh for saving your eMMC content. The flip-side is provided here in the text such that you need to go through a couple of steps before you trash your eMMC. Steps to save The steps for saving off your eMMC contents to a file: Get a 4GB or larger uSD card that is FAT formatted. Make sure that the partition on the uSD card is marked as active. Download beagleboneblack-save-emmc.zip and extract the contents onto your uSD card. Eject uSD card from your computer, insert into powered-off BeagleBone Black and apply power to your board while holding down the S2 button (release button a couple seconds after boot). IMPORTANT: Due to the way the environment sets the partition mmcblk1, some newer boards (shipped with Debian 7.5 or newer) won't work with the autorun.sh. As a workaround, instead of holding down the S2 button, just power the board with the uSD card inserted. IMPORTANT: On Rev C BeagleBone Blacks from element14, you need to create a folder titled &quot;dtbs&quot; and copy am335x-boneblack.dtb into it in order for the SD card to be booted. IMPORTANT: On Rev C BeagleBone Greens from Seed Studio, you need to create a folder titled &quot;dtbs&quot; and copy am335x-boneblack.dtb to dtbs/am335x-bonegreen.dtb (note the name change) in order for the SD card to be booted. You'll notice USR0 (the LED closest to the S1 button in the corner) will (after about 20 seconds) start to blink steadily, rather than the double-pulse &quot;heartbeat&quot; pattern that is typical when your BeagleBone Black is running the typical Linux kernel configuration. It'll run for a bit under 10 minutes and then USR0 will stay ON steady. That's your cue to remove power, remove the uSD card and put it back into your computer. You should see a file called BeagleBoneBlack-eMMC-image-XXXXX.img.gz, where XXXXX is a set of random numbers. Save off this file to use for restoring your image later. NOTE: Because the date won't be set on your board, you might want to adjust the date on the file to remember when you made it. NOTE: Delete the file if you want to make room for a new backup image. NOTE: If you plan to use Windows Win32 Disk Imager, you'll need to uncompress the image. It is compressed due to some FAT (non-FAT32) partitions not being able to store more than 2GB files. NOTE: To mark a partition as active in Windows 7: Open command prompt and enter the following commands: diskpart -&gt; list disk -&gt; select disk x (where x is the uSD card) -&gt; list partition -&gt; select partition 1 (assuming the uSD card has 1 partition) -&gt; active. Performing restore/flashing To restore the file, make sure there is a valid BeagleBoneBlack-eMMC-image-XXXX.img file on the uSD card and edit autorun.sh with your favorite text editor to contain the following: #!/bin/sh echo timer &gt; /sys/class/leds/beaglebone\:green\:usr0/trigger gunzip -c /mnt/BBB-eMMC-XXXXX.img.gz | dd of=/dev/mmcblk1 bs=16M UUID=$(/sbin/blkid -c /dev/null -s UUID -o value /dev/mmcblk1p2) mkdir -p /mnt mount /dev/mmcblk1p2 /mnt sed -i &quot;s/^uuid=.*\$/uuid=$UUID/&quot; /mnt/boot/uEnv.txt umount /mnt sync echo default-on &gt; /sys/class/leds/beaglebone\:green\:usr0/trigger NOTE: Be certain to replace the 'XXXXX' above with the proper name of your image file. NOTE: You can share and use other people's image files, but be sure to have them uncompressed on the card or add decompression to the script. NOTE: The UUID replacement is required for recent Debian images. If you have something other than a 2 partition image, you might need to adjust or remove the lines that configure the UUID. They should be generally safe, but be aware that the newer u-boots that ship with BeagleBone Black attempt to use the UUID and pointing the '/dev/mmcblk1p2' to the right root partition is important. NOTE: if you have difficulty booting a Rev. C BBB with this tool mount the SD card and make the following changes: cd /mnt #or wherever you have mounted the card mkdir dtbs cp am335x-boneblack.dtb dtbs/am335x-boneblack.dtb # if you have a BeageBoneGreen just change the name: cp am335x-boneblack.dtb dtbs/am335x-bonegreen.dtb You may also try booting with the barrel jack (AC power) rather than the USB port.

The link to the source for the firmware is in the commit. Alternatives For many BeagleBone Debian users, there is a simple alternative of using the /opt/scripts/tools/eMMC/beaglebone-black-make-microSD-flasher-from-eMMC.sh to write an image from the on-board eMMC to a microSD card in a way that the microSD card becomes a &quot;flasher&quot; to write to other BeagleBone eMMCs. Simply boot off the on-board eMMC that you wish to copy, insert a blank microSD card at least 4GB, run the script as root and wait for the script to complete. At that point, you shut down your board and remove the microSD card. Booting off that microSD card on other BeagleBones should result in the typical &quot;flasher&quot; process writing the contents onto that BeagleBone's eMMC. The source code for the script is at https://github.com/RobertCNelson/boot-scripts/blob/master/tools/eMMC/beaglebone-black-make-microSD-flasher-from-eMMC.sh.

The command “fdisk -l” will list all the storage devices seen by the operating system: Here is without any devices in the uSD slot. Listed is the internal eMMC storage device (listing only relevant parts): fdisk-l-noSD After inserting a 32MB uSD card we see this additional device: fdisk-l-32MSD After inserting a 2 GB uSD card we see this device instead: fdisk-l-2GSD We realize that the any card inserted in the uSD slot is characterized by “/dev/mmcblk1p1”. “mmc” stands for “multimedia card” -both SD cards and eMMC devices conform to the “multimedia card” specification. “blk1” I think represents “block device 1” and “p1” is “partition 1” However, if the uSD card is already inserted during, we see the following: fdisk-l-beforeboot The device is assigned /dev/mmcblk0p1. It appears the the order the device numbers are assigned at boot time is uSD card first, then internal eMMC. Mounting the uSD card In order to access the contents on the uSD card, the device must be first mounted. First create a “mount point” (a folder). Here I use the directory /media which is already present. Under /media create a directory to mount the uSD card. I created /media/card, /media/usb and /media/nas to represent the 3 different places where music tracks can be stored. Use the command “mount” mount.card The “-v” flag in “mount” is optional. Means “verbose”. Notice that after mounting the uSD card, I can see the “smallmusic” directory and 1 mp3 track. Keep in mind that if the uSD card is already inserted at boot time, it is assigned “mmcblk0p1” instead of “mmcblk1p1” ACCESSING USB MEMORY STICK If digital audio is transmitted through the I2S interface, then the USB host can also be used for a USB memory device. The same procedure can be used to mount a usb memory stick: Insert a USB storage to the USB host connector Type “fdisk -l” to identify the device. Notice that it is /dev/sda1 Type mount /dev/sda1 /”mount point” in my case, mount /dev/sda1 /media/usb Inserting a USB storage device will show up as: fdiskUSB Since there is only one usb host port, a USB memory device will always appear as /dev/sda1 whether it is present during boot or not. AUTOMATING THE MOUNT PROCESS It becomes cumbersome to have to access the board through the command line in order to mount a storage device. For a music device, the ideal is to have these storage devices mounted automatically. I tried different ways to auto-mount the devices when they are inserted: Autofs: looks like the most promising but did not work in my installation while following this excellent guide [link] usbmount: works well with uSD cards and USB storage at any time after boot, but when deleting the X11 package, it wound fail to mount uSD cards. usbmount was last updated in 2007 and is currently unmaintained. Add mount instructions in /etc/fstab which is invoked only during boot time. For now the “best” option in my environment seems using /etc/fstab and ensuring the storage devices are present during boot. This seems a reasonable configuration for an audio player: Insert the storage devices and turn-on the device. Even if switching to another storage device requiring a reboot, the booting process is very short. usbmount has better functionality because it works after boot. I didn’t like the fact that it stopped working for SD cards after I removed the X11 package (which I do not need). I’ll wait for more help on autofs and then I think I’ll switch to autofs. For USB I added the following line to the /etc/fstab file. usbFstab Note the following: Add the “nofail” option. Without it the board will not be able to boot if no USB memory is present in the USB port. Ensure that the USB memory has a single partition since we are assuming it is always /dev/sda1. A newly formatted USB memory device will have a single partition For the uSD Card and assuming that the card is inserted prior to boot, I added the following line: fstab-card Insert a uSD card and a USB memory device, boot the board and they will be mounted under /media/card and /media/usb (or whatever directory you had specified in /etc/fstab.

This would mean that on each bout /etc/fstab will be read and all the disk partitions – mount points are to be mounted exactly in the same order and in the same places for the OS at the specified boot level. Maybe also the ‘df’ command, with all its switches …, will work. That’s much easy than using ‘fdisk -l’ … on my poor mind. That’s since BSD, mount, the first. I don’t remember about ‘df’. Several UNIX flavours have had changes for that last. Ciao. Salvo PS TU for all UR work, that’s really interesting from several points of view. BlgGear March 19, 2014 at 19:25 Reply Thanks for sharing. My concern is that as a music player, I would set it up totally headless. (of course in order to play a track, I would have to use the command line, but I have not thought of this part yet :-)). I did try autofs but couldn’t figure out why it would not work, so I gave up… Foundatron March 22, 2014 at 15:33 Reply Another great post! you mentioned “low noise power supplies”. Can you prove some links? Foundatron March 22, 2014 at 15:34 Reply errr….provide some links:) BlgGear March 22, 2014 at 22:14 Reply For the moment I am using a linear 5V, 1A supply that came with an old ZIP drive. A linear supply (those bigger and heavier transformer-based) are lower noise than the newer switching types. No trackbacks yet.

Jan 2012 in Machen Gestern Abend haben wir unsere Berliner Etsy Labs in eine Kalligrafie-Kreativschmiede verwandelt. Grafikdesignerin Sarah Hartwig zeigte uns, wie man aus einer Getränkedose einem Essstäbchen und Klebefolie einen „Cola Pen“ zaubert und diesen mit schwarzer Tinte zum Malen bringt. Falls ihr Lust bekommen habt, euren eigenen Stift herzustellen, dann findet ihr hier eine kleine Anleitung…. Die Tinte lässt sich jedoch nicht nur mithilfe eines Cola Pens auf Papier bringen, sondern auch andere Materialen wie Kiefernadeln, Walnüsse oder Holz sind dafür hervorragend geeignet. Weitere Anregungen erhaltet ihr auf Sarahs Webseite. Probiert es doch einfach mal aus. Noch ein kleiner Hinweis von mir: Zieht euch vielleicht Gummihandschuhe an, damit eure Finger danach nicht genauso schmutzig aussehen wie meine.

                   NS1:content=" About Sakis3g How to use Download Keep alive Comments Sakis3g About Sakis3g Sakis3g is a script which creates an Internet connection using 3G modems. The software works with most USB and Bluetooth modems. Sakis3g is frequently used in devices such as Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone Black. The script can be used via a graphical user interface or through command lines. How to use Sakis3g The instructions presented here should work on most Linux distributions. Feel free to post a comment at the bottom of the page if there are any issues. The first step is to make sure you have the ppp package installed. Then the Sakis3g package can be downloaded, unzipped, made executable and then run. First check that you have ppp installed sudo apt-get install ppp Now download the Sakis3g package sudo wget &quot;http://www.sakis3g.com/downloads/sakis3g.tar.gz&quot; -O sakis3g.tar.gz Then unzip the file sudo tar -xzvf sakis3g.tar.gz Make the file executable sudo chmod +x sakis3g And finally launch it ./sakis3g --interactive Sakis3g will start in an interactive mode. Select the right options for your modem and either choose a predefined APN or enter a custom APN. If one of the custom APN fields is empty (no user and/or no password required), then enter 0. If the connection is successful, you will get a confirmation message. If the modem is identified, but it fails to connect, the APN settings might be wrong. If the modem can't be configured, it may be possible that the modem requires additional configuration. Please enter your problem and modem details in the comments if the configuration fails. Download Sakis3g To directly download the latest version Sakis3g script, please click here: Download The script is suitable for all architectures with USB ports (i386, amd64, armv4t &amp; armv5t). The package includes usb-modeswitch, required to switch some 3G modems from CDROM mode to the modem mode. The software requires the ppp package to be installed and also possibly wvdial. Keep alive Sakis3g will not ensure the connection is kept alive. In poor signal areas it is very likely that the connection will drop after some time. In critical situations where the connection needs to be restored automatically, you can use UMTSkeeper, a script which ensures the connection is restored automatically. For more information about UMTSkeeper please click here. Note that UMTSkeeper already includes sakis3g. Make sure that the resetusb program included in UMTSkeeper executes properly on your Linux machine! It will not run by default on Raspberry Pi or Beaglebone Black! To check that resetusb works fine on your machine, run the following command in terminal from within the umtskeeper directory: sudo resetusb /dev/bus/usb/-port-/-dev-You can get the port and device number of the modem by typing lsusb in terminal. If an error occurs when running the command mentioned above, resetusb needs to be recompiled by using the following command: sudo gcc resetusb.c -o resetusb Donate If you've found this website useful and my comments helpful, you can donate any sum using the button below. Sponsors Analizoare de gaze | Kronstadt Energii Regenerabile Comments If you require assistance, please leave a comment below. Sakis3g script was developed by Sakis Dimopoulos and not by the author of this website. "

Description¶ Install packages from: PyPI (and other indexes) using requirement specifiers. VCS project urls. Local project directories. Local or remote source archives. pip also supports installing from &quot;requirements files&quot;, which provide an easy way to specify a whole environment to be installed. Overview¶ Pip install has several stages: Identify the base requirements. The user supplied arguments are processed here. Resolve dependencies. What will be installed is determined here. Build wheels. All the dependencies that can be are built into wheels. Install the packages (and uninstall anything being upgraded/replaced). Argument Handling¶ When looking at the items to be installed, pip checks what type of item each is, in the following order: Project or archive URL. Local directory (which must contain a setup.py, or pip will report an error). Local file (a sdist or wheel format archive, following the naming conventions for those formats). A requirement, as specified in PEP 440. Each item identified is added to the set of requirements to be satisfied by the install. Working Out the Name and Version¶ For each candidate item, pip needs to know the project name and version. For wheels (identified by the .whl file extension) this can be obtained from the filename, as per the Wheel spec. For local directories, or explicitly specified sdist files, the setup.py egg_info command is used to determine the project metadata. For sdists located via an index, the filename is parsed for the name and project version (this is in theory slightly less reliable than using the egg_info command, but avoids downloading and processing unnecessary numbers of files). Any URL may use the #egg=name syntax (see VCS Support) to explicitly state the project name. Satisfying Requirements¶ Once pip has the set of requirements to satisfy, it chooses which version of each requirement to install using the simple rule that the latest version that satisfies the given constraints will be installed (but see here for an exception regarding pre-release versions). Where more than one source of the chosen version is available, it is assumed that any source is acceptable (as otherwise the versions would differ). Installation Order¶ As of v6.1.0, pip installs dependencies before their dependents, i.e. in &quot;topological order&quot;. This is the only commitment pip currently makes related to order. While it may be coincidentally true that pip will install things in the order of the install arguments or in the order of the items in a requirements file, this is not a promise. In the event of a dependency cycle (aka &quot;circular dependency&quot;), the current implementation (which might possibly change later) has it such that the first encountered member of the cycle is installed last. For instance, if quux depends on foo which depends on bar which depends on baz, which depends on foo: pip install quux ... Installing collected packages baz, bar, foo, quux pip install bar ... Installing collected packages foo, baz, bar Prior to v6.1.0, pip made no commitments about install order. The decision to install topologically is based on the principle that installations should proceed in a way that leaves the environment usable at each step. This has two main practical benefits: Concurrent use of the environment during the install is more likely to work. A failed install is less likely to leave a broken environment. Although pip would like to support failure rollbacks eventually, in the mean time, this is an improvement. Although the new install order is not intended to replace (and does not replace) the use of setup_requires to declare build dependencies, it may help certain projects install from sdist (that might previously fail) that fit the following profile: They have build dependencies that are also declared as install dependencies using install_requires. python setup.py egg_info works without their build dependencies being installed. For whatever reason, they don't or won't declare their build dependencies using setup_requires. Requirements File Format¶ Each line of the requirements file indicates something to be installed, and like arguments to pip install, the following forms are supported: [[--option]...] &lt;requirement specifier&gt; [; markers] [[--option]...] &lt;archive url/path&gt; [-e] &lt;local project path&gt; [-e] &lt;vcs project url&gt; For details on requirement specifiers, see Requirement Specifiers. See the pip install Examples for examples of all these forms. A line that begins with # is treated as a comment and ignored. Whitespace followed by a # causes the # and the remainder of the line to be treated as a comment. A line ending in an unescaped \ is treated as a line continuation and the newline following it is effectively ignored. Comments are stripped before line continuations are processed. The following options are supported: -i, --index-url --extra-index-url --no-index -f, --find-links --no-binary --only-binary --require-hashes For example, to specify --no-index and 2 --find-links locations: --no-index --find-links /my/local/archives --find-links http://some.archives.com/archives If you wish, you can refer to other requirements files, like this: -r more_requirements.txt You can also refer to constraints files, like this: -c some_constraints.txt Example Requirements File¶ Use pip install -r example-requirements.txt to install: # ####### example-requirements.txt ####### # ###### Requirements without Version Specifiers ###### nose nose-cov beautifulsoup4 # ###### Requirements with Version Specifiers ###### # See https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#version-specifiers docopt == 0.6.1 # Version Matching.

Generally speaking, a requirement specifier is composed of a project name followed by optional version specifiers. PEP508 contains a full specification of the format of a requirement (pip does not support the url_req form of specifier at this time). Some examples: SomeProject SomeProject == 1.3 SomeProject &gt;=1.2,&lt;.2.0 SomeProject[foo, bar] SomeProject~=1.4.2 Since version 6.0, pip also supports specifiers containing environment markers like so: SomeProject ==5.4 ; python_version &lt; '2.7' SomeProject; sys_platform == 'win32' Environment markers are supported in the command line and in requirements files. Note Use quotes around specifiers in the shell when using &gt;, &lt;, or when using environment markers. Don't use quotes in requirement files. [1] Per-requirement Overrides¶ Since version 7.0 pip supports controlling the command line options given to setup.py via requirements files. This disables the use of wheels (cached or otherwise) for that package, as setup.py does not exist for wheels. The --global-option and --install-option options are used to pass options to setup.py. For example: FooProject &gt;= 1.2 --global-option=&quot;--no-user-cfg&quot; \ --install-option=&quot;--prefix='/usr/local'&quot; \ --install-option=&quot;--no-compile&quot; The above translates roughly into running FooProject's setup.py script as: python setup.py --no-user-cfg install --prefix='/usr/local' --no-compile Note that the only way of giving more than one option to setup.py is through multiple --global-option and --install-option options, as shown in the example above. The value of each option is passed as a single argument to the setup.py script. Therefore, a line such as the following is invalid and would result in an installation error. # Invalid. Please use '--install-option' twice as shown above. FooProject &gt;= 1.2 --install-option=&quot;--prefix=/usr/local --no-compile&quot; Pre-release Versions¶ Starting with v1.4, pip will only install stable versions as specified by PEP426 by default. If a version cannot be parsed as a compliant PEP426 version then it is assumed to be a pre-release. If a Requirement specifier includes a pre-release or development version (e.g. &gt;=0.0.dev0) then pip will allow pre-release and development versions for that requirement. This does not include the != flag. The pip install command also supports a --pre flag that will enable installing pre-releases and development releases. VCS Support¶ pip supports installing from Git, Mercurial, Subversion and Bazaar, and detects the type of VCS using url prefixes: &quot;git+&quot;, &quot;hg+&quot;, &quot;bzr+&quot;, &quot;svn+&quot;. pip requires a working VCS command on your path: git, hg, svn, or bzr. VCS projects can be installed in editable mode (using the --editable option) or not. For editable installs, the clone location by default is &quot;&lt;venv path&gt;/src/SomeProject&quot; in virtual environments, and &quot;&lt;cwd&gt;/src/SomeProject&quot; for global installs. The --src option can be used to modify this location. For non-editable installs, the project is built locally in a temp dir and then installed normally. The &quot;project name&quot; component of the url suffix &quot;egg=&lt;project name&gt;-&lt;version&gt;&quot; is used by pip in its dependency logic to identify the project prior to pip downloading and analyzing the metadata. The optional &quot;version&quot; component of the egg name is not functionally important. It merely provides a human-readable clue as to what version is in use. For projects where setup.py is not in the root of project, &quot;subdirectory&quot; component is used. Value of &quot;subdirectory&quot; component should be a path starting from root of the project to where setup.py is located. So if your repository layout is: pkg_dir/ setup.py # setup.py for package pkg some_module.py other_dir/ some_file some_other_file You'll need to use pip install -e vcs+protocol://repo_url/#egg=pkg&amp;subdirectory=pkg_dir. Git¶ pip currently supports cloning over git, git+https and git+ssh: Here are the supported forms: [-e] git+git://git.myproject.org/MyProject#egg=MyProject [-e] git+https://git.myproject.org/MyProject#egg=MyProject [-e] git+ssh://git.myproject.org/MyProject#egg=MyProject -e git+git@git.myproject.org:MyProject#egg=MyProject Passing branch names, a commit hash or a tag name is possible like so: [-e] git://git.myproject.org/MyProject.git@master#egg=MyProject [-e] git://git.myproject.org/MyProject.git@v1.0#egg=MyProject [-e] git://git.myproject.org/MyProject.git@da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709#egg=MyProject Mercurial¶ The supported schemes are: hg+http, hg+https, hg+static-http and hg+ssh. Here are the supported forms: [-e] hg+http://hg.myproject.org/MyProject#egg=MyProject [-e] hg+https://hg.myproject.org/MyProject#egg=MyProject [-e] hg+ssh://hg.myproject.org/MyProject#egg=MyProject You can also specify a revision number, a revision hash, a tag name or a local branch name like so: [-e] hg+http://hg.myproject.org/MyProject@da39a3ee5e6b#egg=MyProject [-e] hg+http://hg.myproject.org/MyProject@2019#egg=MyProject [-e] hg+http://hg.myproject.org/MyProject@v1.0#egg=MyProject [-e] hg+http://hg.myproject.org/MyProject@special_feature#egg=MyProject Subversion¶ pip supports the URL schemes svn, svn+svn, svn+http, svn+https, svn+ssh. You can also give specific revisions to an SVN URL, like so: [-e] svn+svn://svn.myproject.org/svn/MyProject#egg=MyProject [-e] svn+http://svn.myproject.org/svn/MyProject/trunk@2019#egg=MyProject which will check out revision 2019. @{20080101} would also check out the revision from 2008-01-01. You can only check out specific revisions using -e svn+.... Bazaar¶ pip supports Bazaar using the bzr+http, bzr+https, bzr+ssh, bzr+sftp, bzr+ftp and bzr+lp schemes. Here are the supported forms: [-e] bzr+http://bzr.myproject.org/MyProject/trunk#egg=MyProject [-e] bzr+sftp://user@myproject.org/MyProject/trunk#egg=MyProject [-e] bzr+ssh://user@myproject.org/MyProject/trunk#egg=MyProject [-e] bzr+ftp://user@myproject.org/MyProject/trunk#egg=MyProject [-e] bzr+lp:MyProject#egg=MyProject Tags or revisions can be installed like so: [-e] bzr+https://bzr.myproject.org/MyProject/trunk@2019#egg=MyProject [-e] bzr+http://bzr.myproject.org/MyProject/trunk@v1.0#egg=MyProject Finding Packages¶ pip searches for packages on PyPI using the http simple interface, which is documented here and there pip offers a number of Package Index Options for modifying how packages are found. pip looks for packages in a number of places, on PyPI (if not disabled via `--no-index`), in the local filesystem, and in any additional repositories specified via `--find-links` or `--index-url`. There is no ordering in the locations that are searched, rather they are all checked, and the &quot;best&quot; match for the requirements (in terms of version number - see PEP440 for details) is selected. See the pip install Examples. SSL Certificate Verification¶ Starting with v1.3, pip provides SSL certificate verification over https, to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks against PyPI downloads. Caching¶ Starting with v6.0, pip provides an on-by-default cache which functions similarly to that of a web browser. While the cache is on by default and is designed do the right thing by default you can disable the cache and always access PyPI by utilizing the --no-cache-dir option. When making any HTTP request pip will first check its local cache to determine if it has a suitable response stored for that request which has not expired. If it does then it simply returns that response and doesn't make the request. If it has a response stored, but it has expired, then it will attempt to make a conditional request to refresh the cache which will either return an empty response telling pip to simply use the cached item (and refresh the expiration timer) or it will return a whole new response which pip can then store in the cache. When storing items in the cache, pip will respect the CacheControl header if it exists, or it will fall back to the Expires header if that exists. This allows pip to function as a browser would, and allows the index server to communicate to pip how long it is reasonable to cache any particular item. While this cache attempts to minimize network activity, it does not prevent network access altogether. If you want a local install solution that circumvents accessing PyPI, see Installing from local packages. The default location for the cache directory depends on the Operating System: Unix ~/.cache/pip and it respects the XDG_CACHE_HOME directory. OS X ~/Library/Caches/pip. Windows &lt;CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA&gt;\pip\Cache Wheel Cache¶ Pip will read from the subdirectory wheels within the pip cache directory and use any packages found there. This is disabled via the same --no-cache-dir option that disables the HTTP cache. The internal structure of that is not part of the pip API. As of 7.0, pip makes a subdirectory for each sdist that wheels are built from and places the resulting wheels inside. Pip attempts to choose the best wheels from those built in preference to building a new wheel. Note that this means when a package has both optional C extensions and builds py tagged wheels when the C extension can't be built that pip will not attempt to build a better wheel for Pythons that would have supported it, once any generic wheel is built. To correct this, make sure that the wheels are built with Python specific tags - e.g. pp on Pypy. When no wheels are found for an sdist, pip will attempt to build a wheel automatically and insert it into the wheel cache. Hash-Checking Mode¶ Since version 8.0, pip can check downloaded package archives against local hashes to protect against remote tampering. To verify a package against one or more hashes, add them to the end of the line: FooProject == 1.2 --hash=sha256:2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824 \ --hash=sha256:486ea46224d1bb4fb680f34f7c9ad96a8f24ec88be73ea8e5a6c65260e9cb8a7 (The ability to use multiple hashes is important when a package has both binary and source distributions or when it offers binary distributions for a variety of platforms.) The recommended hash algorithm at the moment is sha256, but stronger ones are allowed, including all those supported by hashlib. However, weaker ones such as md5, sha1, and sha224 are excluded to avoid giving a false sense of security. Hash verification is an all-or-nothing proposition. Specifying a --hash against any requirement not only checks that hash but also activates a global hash-checking mode, which imposes several other security restrictions: Hashes are required for all requirements. This is because a partially-hashed requirements file is of little use and thus likely an error: a malicious actor could slip bad code into the installation via one of the unhashed requirements. Note that hashes embedded in URL-style requirements via the #md5=... syntax suffice to satisfy this rule (regardless of hash strength, for legacy reasons), though you should use a stronger hash like sha256 whenever possible. Hashes are required for all dependencies. An error results if there is a dependency that is not spelled out and hashed in the requirements file. Requirements that take the form of project names (rather than URLs or local filesystem paths) must be pinned to a specific version using ==. This prevents a surprising hash mismatch upon the release of a new version that matches the requirement specifier. --egg is disallowed, because it delegates installation of dependencies to setuptools, giving up pip's ability to enforce any of the above. Hash-checking mode can be forced on with the --require-hashes command-line option: $ pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.txt ... Hashes are required in --require-hashes mode (implicitly on when a hash is specified for any package). These requirements were missing hashes, leaving them open to tampering. These are the hashes the downloaded archives actually had. You can add lines like these to your requirements files to prevent tampering. pyelasticsearch==1.0 --hash=sha256:44ddfb1225054d7d6b1d02e9338e7d4809be94edbe9929a2ec0807d38df993fa more-itertools==2.2 --hash=sha256:93e62e05c7ad3da1a233def6731e8285156701e3419a5fe279017c429ec67ce0 This can be useful in deploy scripts, to ensure that the author of the requirements file provided hashes. It is also a convenient way to bootstrap your list of hashes, since it shows the hashes of the packages it fetched. It fetches only the preferred archive for each package, so you may still need to add hashes for alternatives archives using pip hash: for instance if there is both a binary and a source distribution. The wheel cache is disabled in hash-checking mode to prevent spurious hash mismatch errors. These would otherwise occur while installing sdists that had already been automatically built into cached wheels: those wheels would be selected for installation, but their hashes would not match the sdist ones from the requirements file. A further complication is that locally built wheels are nondeterministic: contemporary modification times make their way into the archive, making hashes unpredictable across machines and cache flushes. Compilation of C code adds further nondeterminism, as many compilers include random-seeded values in their output. However, wheels fetched from index servers are the same every time. They land in pip's HTTP cache, not its wheel cache, and are used normally in hash-checking mode. The only downside of having the wheel cache disabled is thus extra build time for sdists, and this can be solved by making sure pre-built wheels are available from the index server. Hash-checking mode also works with pip download and pip wheel. A comparison of hash-checking mode with other repeatability strategies is available in the User Guide. Warning Beware of the setup_requires keyword arg in setup.py. The (rare) packages that use it will cause those dependencies to be downloaded by setuptools directly, skipping pip's hash-checking. If you need to use such a package, see Controlling setup_requires. Warning Be careful not to nullify all your security work when you install your actual project by using setuptools directly: for example, by calling python setup.py install, python setup.py develop, or easy_install. Setuptools will happily go out and download, unchecked, anything you missed in your requirements file—and it’s easy to miss things as your project evolves. To be safe, install your project using pip and --no-deps. Instead of python setup.py develop, use... pip install --no-deps -e . Instead of python setup.py install, use... pip install --no-deps . Hashes from PyPI¶ PyPI provides an MD5 hash in the fragment portion of each package download URL, like #md5=123..., which pip checks as a protection against download corruption. Other hash algorithms that have guaranteed support from hashlib are also supported here: sha1, sha224, sha384, sha256, and sha512. Since this hash originates remotely, it is not a useful guard against tampering and thus does not satisfy the --require-hashes demand that every package have a local hash. &quot;Editable&quot; Installs¶ &quot;Editable&quot; installs are fundamentally &quot;setuptools develop mode&quot; installs. You can install local projects or VCS projects in &quot;editable&quot; mode: $ pip install -e path/to/SomeProject $ pip install -e git+http://repo/my_project.git#egg=SomeProject (See the VCS Support section above for more information on VCS-related syntax.) For local projects, the &quot;SomeProject.egg-info&quot; directory is created relative to the project path. This is one advantage over just using setup.py develop, which creates the &quot;egg-info&quot; directly relative the current working directory. Controlling setup_requires¶ Setuptools offers the setup_requires setup() keyword for specifying dependencies that need to be present in order for the setup.py script to run. Internally, Setuptools uses easy_install to fulfill these dependencies. pip has no way to control how these dependencies are located. None of the Package Index Options have an effect. The solution is to configure a &quot;system&quot; or &quot;personal&quot; Distutils configuration file to manage the fulfillment. For example, to have the dependency located at an alternate index, add this: [easy_install] index_url = https://my.index-mirror.com To have the dependency located from a local directory and not crawl PyPI, add this: [easy_install] allow_hosts = '' find_links = file:///path/to/local/archives/ Build System Interface¶ In order for pip to install a package from source, setup.py must implement the following commands: setup.py egg_info [--egg-base XXX] setup.py install --record XXX [--single-version-externally-managed] [--root XXX] [--compile|--no-compile] [--install-headers XXX] The egg_info command should create egg metadata for the package, as described in the setuptools documentation at http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html#egg-info-create-egg-metadata-and-set-build-tags The install command should implement the complete process of installing the package to the target directory XXX. To install a package in &quot;editable&quot; mode (pip install -e), setup.py must implement the following command: setup.py develop --no-deps This should implement the complete process of installing the package in &quot;editable&quot; mode. All packages will be attempted to built into wheels: setup.py bdist_wheel -d XXX One further setup.py command is invoked by pip install: setup.py clean This command is invoked to clean up temporary commands from the build. (TODO: Investigate in more detail when this command is required). No other build system commands are invoked by the pip install command. Installing a package from a wheel does not invoke the build system at all. Options¶ -c, --constraint &lt;file&gt;¶ Constrain versions using the given constraints file. This option can be used multiple times. -e, --editable &lt;path/url&gt;¶ Install a project in editable mode (i.e. setuptools &quot;develop mode&quot;) from a local project path or a VCS url. -r, --requirement &lt;file&gt;¶ Install from the given requirements file. This option can be used multiple times. -b, --build &lt;dir&gt;¶ Directory to unpack packages into and build in. -t, --target &lt;dir&gt;¶ Install packages into &lt;dir&gt;. By default this will not replace existing files/folders in &lt;dir&gt;. Use --upgrade to replace existing packages in &lt;dir&gt; with new versions. -d, --download &lt;dir&gt;¶ Download packages into &lt;dir&gt; instead of installing them, regardless of what's already installed. --src &lt;dir&gt;¶ Directory to check out editable projects into. The default in a virtualenv is &quot;&lt;venv path&gt;/src&quot;. The default for global installs is &quot;&lt;current dir&gt;/src&quot;. -U, --upgrade¶ Upgrade all specified packages to the newest available version. This process is recursive regardless of whether a dependency is already satisfied. --force-reinstall¶ When upgrading, reinstall all packages even if they are already up-to-date. -I, --ignore-installed¶ Ignore the installed packages (reinstalling instead). --no-deps¶ Don't install package dependencies. --install-option &lt;options&gt;¶ Extra arguments to be supplied to the setup.py install command (use like --install-option=&quot;--install-scripts=/usr/local/bin&quot;). Use multiple --install-option options to pass multiple options to setup.py install. If you are using an option with a directory path, be sure to use absolute path. --global-option &lt;options&gt;¶ Extra global options to be supplied to the setup.py call before the install command. --user¶ Install to the Python user install directory for your platform. Typically ~/.local/, or %APPDATA%Python on Windows. (See the Python documentation for site.USER_BASE for full details.) --egg¶ Install packages as eggs, not 'flat', like pip normally does. This option is not about installing from eggs. (WARNING: Because this option overrides pip's normal install logic, requirements files may not behave as expected.) --root &lt;dir&gt;¶ Install everything relative to this alternate root directory. --prefix &lt;dir&gt;¶ Installation prefix where lib, bin and other top-level folders are placed --compile¶ Compile py files to pyc --no-compile¶ Do not compile py files to pyc --no-use-wheel¶ Do not Find and prefer wheel archives when searching indexes and find-links locations. DEPRECATED in favour of --no-binary. --no-binary &lt;format_control&gt;¶ Do not use binary packages. Can be supplied multiple times, and each time adds to the existing value. Accepts either :all: to disable all binary packages, :none: to empty the set, or one or more package names with commas between them. Note that some packages are tricky to compile and may fail to install when this option is used on them. --only-binary &lt;format_control&gt;¶ Do not use source packages. Can be supplied multiple times, and each time adds to the existing value. Accepts either :all: to disable all source packages, :none: to empty the set, or one or more package names with commas between them. Packages without binary distributions will fail to install when this option is used on them. --pre¶ Include pre-release and development versions. By default, pip only finds stable versions. --no-clean¶ Don't clean up build directories. --require-hashes¶ Require a hash to check each requirement against, for repeatable installs. This option is implied when any package in a requirements file has a --hash option. -i, --index-url &lt;url&gt;¶ Base URL of Python Package Index (default https://pypi.python.org/simple). --extra-index-url &lt;url&gt;¶ Extra URLs of package indexes to use in addition to --index-url. --no-index¶ Ignore package index (only looking at --find-links URLs instead). -f, --find-links &lt;url&gt;¶ If a url or path to an html file, then parse for links to archives. If a local path or file:// url that's a directory, then look for archives in the directory listing. --process-dependency-links¶ Enable the processing of dependency links. Examples¶ Install SomePackage and its dependencies from PyPI using Requirement Specifiers $ pip install SomePackage # latest version $ pip install SomePackage==1.0.4 # specific version $ pip install 'SomePackage&gt;=1.0.4' # minimum version Install a list of requirements specified in a file. See the Requirements files. $ pip install -r requirements.txt Upgrade an already installed SomePackage to the latest from PyPI. $ pip install --upgrade SomePackage Install a local project in &quot;editable&quot; mode. See the section on Editable Installs. $ pip install -e . # project in current directory $ pip install -e path/to/project # project in another directory Install a project from VCS in &quot;editable&quot; mode. See the sections on VCS Support and Editable Installs. $ pip install -e git+https://git.repo/some_pkg.git#egg=SomePackage # from git $ pip install -e hg+https://hg.repo/some_pkg.git#egg=SomePackage # from mercurial $ pip install -e svn+svn://svn.repo/some_pkg/trunk/#egg=SomePackage # from svn $ pip install -e git+https://git.repo/some_pkg.git@feature#egg=SomePackage # from 'feature' branch $ pip install -e &quot;git+https://git.repo/some_repo.git#egg=subdir&amp;subdirectory=subdir_path&quot; # install a python package from a repo subdirectory Install a package with setuptools extras. $ pip install SomePackage[PDF] $ pip install SomePackage[PDF]==3.0 $ pip install -e .[PDF]==3.0 # editable project in current directory Install a particular source archive file. $ pip install ./downloads/SomePackage-1.0.4.tar.gz $ pip install http://my.package.repo/SomePackage-1.0.4.zip Install from alternative package repositories. Install from a different index, and not PyPI $ pip install --index-url http://my.package.repo/simple/ SomePackage Search an additional index during install, in addition to PyPI $ pip install --extra-index-url http://my.package.repo/simple SomePackage Install from a local flat directory containing archives (and don't scan indexes): $ pip install --no-index --find-links=file:///local/dir/ SomePackage $ pip install --no-index --find-links=/local/dir/ SomePackage $ pip install --no-index --find-links=relative/dir/ SomePackage Find pre-release and development versions, in addition to stable versions. By default, pip only finds stable versions. $ pip install --pre SomePackage [1] This is true with the exception that pip v7.0 and v7.0.1 required quotes around specifiers containing environment markers in requirement files.

                   NS1:content=" Home Close Menu Blog Downloads Community Help Forums Education Resources Training Menu Search Buy documentation &gt; installation &gt; installing-images &gt; linux Installing operating system images on Linux Please note that the use of the dd tool can overwrite any partition of your machine. If you specify the wrong device in the instructions below, you could delete your primary Linux partition. Please be careful. Run df -h to see what devices are currently mounted. If your computer has a slot for SD cards, insert the card. If not, insert the card into an SD card reader, then connect the reader to your computer. Run df -h again. The new device that has appeared is your SD card. The left column gives the device name of your SD card; it will be listed as something like /dev/mmcblk0p1 or /dev/sdd1. The last part (p1 or 1 respectively) is the partition number but you want to write to the whole SD card, not just one partition. You therefore need to remove that part from the name, getting, for example, /dev/mmcblk0 or /dev/sdd as the device name for the whole SD card. Note that the SD card can show up more than once in the output of df; it will do this if you have previously written a Raspberry Pi image to this SD card, because the Raspberry Pi SD images have more than one partition. Now that you've noted what the device name is, you need to unmount it so that files can't be read or written to the SD card while you are copying over the SD image. Run umount /dev/sdd1, replacing sdd1 with whatever your SD card's device name is (including the partition number). If your SD card shows up more than once in the output of df due to having multiple partitions on the SD card, you should unmount all of these partitions. In the terminal, write the image to the card with the command below, making sure you replace the input file if= argument with the path to your .img file, and the /dev/sdd in the output file of= argument with the right device name. This is very important, as you will lose all data on the hard drive if you provide the wrong device name. Make sure the device name is the name of the whole SD card as described above, not just a partition of it; for example, sdd, not sdds1 or sddp1, and mmcblk0, not mmcblk0p1. dd bs=4M if=2016-05-27-raspbian-jessie.img of=/dev/sdd Please note that block size set to 4M will work most of the time; if not, please try 1M, although this will take considerably longer. Also note that if you are not logged in as root you will need to prefix this with sudo. The dd command does not give any information of its progress and so may appear to have frozen; it could take more than five minutes to finish writing to the card. If your card reader has an LED it may blink during the write process. To see the progress of the copy operation you can run pkill -USR1 -n -x dd in another terminal, prefixed with sudo if you are not logged in as root. The progress will be displayed in the original window and not the window with the pkill command; it may not display immediately, due to buffering. Instead of dd you can use dcfldd; it will give a progress report about how much has been written. You can check what's written to the SD card by dd-ing from the card back to another image on your hard disk, truncating the new image to the same size as the original, and then running diff (or md5sum) on those two images. The SD card might be bigger than the original image, and dd will make a copy of the whole card. We must therefore truncate the new image to the size of the original image. Make sure you replace the input file if= argument with the right device name. diff should report that the files are identical. dd bs=4M if=/dev/sdd of=from-sd-card.img truncate --reference 2016-05-27-raspbian-jessie.img from-sd-card.img diff -s from-sd-card.img 2016-05-27-raspbian-jessie.img Run sync; this will ensure the write cache is flushed and that it is safe to unmount your SD card. Remove the SD card from the card reader.

                   NS1:content=" Home Packages Forums Wiki Bugs AUR Download pppd From ArchWiki Jump to: navigation, search ppp (Paul's PPP Package) is an open source package which implements the point-to-point protocol (PPP) on Linux and Solaris systems. It is implemented as single pppd daemon and acts as backend for xl2tpd, pptpd and netctl. 3G, L2TP and PPPoE connections are internally based on PPP protocol and therefore can be managed by ppp. Contents [hide] 1 Installation 2 Configuration 2.1 PPPoE 2.2 Starting pppd on boot 3 Tips and tricks 3.1 Do an auto redial 3.2 ISP auto-disconnect after 24h 3.2.1 Using cron 3.2.2 Using a systemd timer 4 Troubleshooting 4.1 Default route 4.2 Masquerading seems to be working fine but some sites do not work 4.3 pppd cannot load kernel module ppp_generic Installation Install the ppp package. Make sure that your kernel is compiled with PPPoE support (present in default kernel): $ zgrep CONFIG_PPPOE /proc/config.gz CONFIG_PPPOE=m Configuration PPPoE Create the connection configuration file: /etc/ppp/peers/your_provider plugin rp-pppoe.so # rp_pppoe_ac 'your ac name' # rp_pppoe_service 'your service name' # network interface eth0 # login name name &quot;someloginname&quot; usepeerdns persist # Uncomment this if you want to enable dial on demand #demand #idle 180 defaultroute hide-password noauth If usepeerdns option is used, pppd will create the /etc/ppp/resolv.conf file with obtained DNS addresses while establishing a connection. By default, the /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/00_dns hook script moves this file to /etc/resolv.conf, allowing the system to use these name servers. If this is undesirable (e.g. you are using a local caching DNS), edit the /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/00_dns.sh as you need. Put a line like this in /etc/ppp/pap-secrets or /etc/ppp/chap-secrets as required by the authentication method used by your ISP. It is OK to write these two files at the same time, pppd will automatically use the appropriate one: someloginname * yourpassword You can now start the link using the command: # pppd call your_provider Alternatively, you can use this # pon your_provider where your_provider is the exact name of your options file in /etc/ppp/peers. To see whether your PPPoE connection is started correctly, check the pppd output in system logs: # journalctl -b --no-pager | grep pppd On a successful connection, you will see something like the following: Jul 09 22:42:33 localhost pppd[239]: Plugin rp-pppoe.so loaded. Jul 09 22:42:33 localhost pppd[239]: RP-PPPoE plugin version 3.8p compiled against pppd 2.4.6 Jul 09 22:42:33 localhost network[184]: RP-PPPoE plugin version 3.8p compiled against pppd 2.4.6 Jul 09 22:42:33 localhost pppd[239]: pppd 2.4.6 started by root, uid 0 Jul 09 22:42:39 localhost pppd[239]: PPP session is 292 Jul 09 22:42:39 localhost pppd[239]: Connected to a0:f3:e4:4f:e3:b0 via interface enp4s0 Jul 09 22:42:39 localhost pppd[239]: Using interface ppp0 Jul 09 22:42:39 localhost pppd[239]: Connect: ppp0 &lt;--&gt; enp4s0 Jul 09 22:42:39 localhost pppd[239]: CHAP authentication succeeded: CHAP authentication success Jul 09 22:42:39 localhost pppd[239]: CHAP authentication succeeded Jul 09 22:42:39 localhost pppd[239]: peer from calling number A0:F3:E4:4F:E3:B0 authorized Jul 09 22:42:39 localhost pppd[239]: Cannot determine ethernet address for proxy ARP Jul 09 22:42:39 localhost pppd[239]: local IP address 10.6.2.137 Jul 09 22:42:39 localhost pppd[239]: remote IP address 10.6.1.1 Jul 09 22:42:39 localhost pppd[239]: primary DNS address 10.6.1.1 Jul 09 22:42:39 localhost pppd[239]: secondary DNS address 210.21.196.6 By default the configuration in /etc/ppp/peers/provider is treated as the default, so if you want to make &quot;your_provider&quot; the default, you can create a link like this # ln -s /etc/ppp/peers/your_provider /etc/ppp/peers/provider Now you can start the link by simply running: # pon To close a connection, use this # poff your_provider Starting pppd on boot Configure the ppp_generic module to load on boot. See Kernel modules#Automatic module handling for more information. Enable the systemd service ppp@your_provider.service. Tips and tricks Do an auto redial If pppd is running, you can force a connection reset by sending the SIGHUP signal to the process: # export PPPD_PID=$(pidof pppd) # kill -s HUP $PPPD_PID And you have redialed the connection. Note: Make sure you have persist option enabled in your /etc/ppp/peers/provider tab. Additionally you might want to set holdoff 0 to reconnect without waiting. ISP auto-disconnect after 24h Note: If you are not running your computer always on (running 24/7) then you can skip this step. If you use a flat-rate always-on connection on a computer, some providers restart your connection after 24h. That makes sure that the IP is rotated every 24h. To compensate, you can use an dynamic DNS service in combination with inadynAUR[broken link: archived in aur-mirror] to compensate for the rotating IP address. But to avoid disconnects when you do not need it, you might try to restart the connection using a cron job or systemd timer at a time of day you know no one will be using the connection (e.g. at 4 AM). Using cron As root, do the following: Create a bash script similar to this and give it a name (e.g. pppd_redial.sh): #!/bin/bash message=&quot;Restarting the PPP connection @:&quot; $(date) pppd_id=$(pidof pppd) kill -s HUP $pppd_id echo $message Give it execute permissions and put it on a path visible to root. Then create a cron job using crontab -e. Check that your EDITOR env variable is set if the command fails. So add anywhere in the file, 0 4 * * * /bin/bash /root/pppd_redial.sh Confirm that cronie service is up and running. If this is not the case, just enable and start it. Save and exit. Your PPPoE connection will now restart every day at 4AM. Using a systemd timer An alternative way to force a reconnect is using a systemd timer and the poff script (in particular its -r option). Simply create a .service and .timer files with the same name: ppp-redial.timer [Unit] Description=Reconnect PPP connections daily [Timer] OnCalendar=*-*-* 05:00:00 [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target ppp-redial.service [Unit] Description=Reconnect PPP connections [Service] Type=simple ExecStart=/usr/bin/poff -r Now just enable and start the timer and systemd will cause a restart at the specified time. Troubleshooting Default route If you have a preconfigured default route before the pppd is started, the default route is kept, so take a look in /var/log/errors.log and if you have something like: pppd[nnnn]: not replacing existing default route via xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx and xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is not the correct route for you Create a new script in /etc/ppp/ip-pre-up.d with this content: /etc/ppp/ip-pre-up.d/10-route-del-default.sh #!/bin/sh /usr/bin/route del default Note: Make sure you have a script named 'ip-pre-up' which launches *.sh in 'ip-pre-up.d' like other launch scripts do. Restart the pppd service. Masquerading seems to be working fine but some sites do not work The MTU under pppoe is 1492 bytes. Most sites use an MTU of 1500. So your connection sends an ICMP 3:4 (fragmentation needed) packet, asking for a smaller MTU, but some sites have their firewall blocking that. Enabling the PMTU clamping in iptables can solve that: iptables -I FORWARD -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN -j TCPMSS --clamp-mss-to-pmtu Now, for some reason, just trying to save the resulting iptables configuration with iptables-save and restoring it later, does not work. It has to be executed after the other iptables configuration had been loaded. So, here is a systemd unit to solve it: pmtu-clamping.service [Unit] Description=PMTU clamping for pppoe Requires=iptables.service After=iptables.service [Service] Type=oneshot ExecStart=/usr/bin/iptables -I FORWARD -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN -j TCPMSS --clamp-mss-to-pmtu [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target And enable it. pppd cannot load kernel module ppp_generic When starting PPTP client, the pppd process cannot locate the appropriate module: Couldn't open the /dev/ppp device: No such device or address Please load the ppp_generic kernel module. The solution is to edit the /etc/modprobe.d/modules.conf file and change alias char-major-108 ppp to alias char-major-108 ppp_generic or just add such alias if it does not exist. The correct module will be loaded after reboot.

Within this environment there are plenty of applications and utilities. In your projects you may want to auto-load one or more of these applications when you run startx to save you having to launch them manually. Popular choices might include LXTerminal, Scratch, Midori and Leafpad. There are two methods you can choose. For most people either one will work but if in doubt use Method 1. In the examples below I’ve added two applications (LXTerminal and Leafpad) but you can add however many you need. Start by booting your Pi to the command prompt. Method 1 This method uses a global list of autostart applications that applies to all user accounts. They will load whenever LXDE is loaded regardless of what user is logged in at the time. Usually this user is the default ‘Pi’ account. Use the following command to launch the nano text editor and edit the autostart file : sudo nano /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart Note : The newer Raspbian image changed the folder “LXDE” to “LXDE-pi” so the line above has been updated. After the last line add a line for each application you wish to autorun. For example if I add lines for LXTerminal and Leafpad my file looks like this : @lxpanel --profile LXDE @pcmanfm --desktop --profile LXDE @lxterminal @leafpad @xscreensaver -no-splash@ To save and exit the nano editor press CTRL-X, Y and then ENTER. You can use your preferred text editor if nano isn’t your first choice. Method 2 The alternative method is to create a configuration file that is unique to the currently logged in user. First you need to edit this text file : sudo nano ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE/autostart As in Method 1 this file represents a list of commands to be executed when the GUI loads. It is usually blank when you first edit it so just add the applications you need to auto-load: @lxterminal @leafpad To save and exit the nano editor press CTRL-X, Y and then ENTER. Test Once your configuration file has been updated you are ready to test. startx The LXDE desktop should load and your chosen applications should launch. Both Methods At The Same Time? Since v0.4.9 If both files are present, lxsession only executes the local file. This means you can no longer use both methods at the same time. Method 2 will take priority over Method 1. Auto-run Minecraft Assuming you have already installed Minecraft on your Pi you can auto-run it as well. When I am in a Python-Minecraft mood I launch Minecraft and a terminal window ready for executing scripts using the following lines : @~/mcpi/minecraft-pi @lxterminal This assume the Minecraft executable is located in ~/mcpi/ (same as /home/pi/mcpi/). Auto-run Python Scripts You can auto-launch your own Python scripts by adding the line : @/usr/bin/python /home/pi/example.py This works best with Method 2 as in this example the Python script is stored in the home directory of the default Pi user. If another user is logged in they wouldn’t have access to this directory so LXDE may not be able to autoload it. Whichever method you used just type startx from the command line and your chosen applications should load automatically. LXDE Desktop Note 1 : The order that you place the application commands doesn’t always mean they will load in that order as different applications will take different amounts of time to load completely. I would tend to put the larger applications first so they have as much time as possible to fire up. i.e. Midori before LXTerminal. Note 2 : Make sure your commands come before the @xscreensaver line.

I’d like to be able to get a python script that outputs text (generated from sensor outputs) to automatically run in a terminal window. Is there an easy way to accomplish that? Reply Matt on May 4, 2014 10:16 am It runs in the background … but you can launch LXTerminal instead and pass it a command line parameter to run a Python script. Haven’t tested it but you could try something like : @lxterminal -e ‘/usr/bin/python /home/pi/myscript.py’ -t ‘MyTitle’ Reply Paul Adomshick on May 6, 2014 4:13 am Much appreciated. I’ll try that. Reply AJ on December 2, 2015 3:35 am IMPORTANT: this line has to be added before the @xscreensaver line. Finally worked for me after reading about that here: https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=91&amp;t=65607 Reply Matt on December 3, 2015 7:23 pm Thanks, I’ve added a note at the bottom of the post. Reply Don Sorensen on May 4, 2014 8:16 pm Looks like a “code” tag got misplaces in your first snippet above. I’m pretty sure the lines “To save and exit the nano editor press CTRL-X, Y and then ENTER. You can use your preferred text editor if nano isn’t your first choice.” don’t belong in the autostart file. I’m sorry if it sounds picky, but I’ve been fighting the way Wordpad puts tags into posts for about a week now. Thought you’d like to know. Great site you’ve got here. Thank you for going through the trouble. Reply Matt on May 4, 2014 8:45 pm Thanks Don. I spotted that just before I published it … then obviously forgot to actually correct it! Thanks for pointing it out. It’s sorted now. Reply Jeremy on January 11, 2015 7:23 pm I couldn’t figure out why I couldn’t get this to work. In the latest raspbian image I downloaded (around Dec 30, 2014) they changed the path for the autostart file that is used. This in method #1: sudo nano /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart is now this: sudo nano /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart I hope that saves someone some time. Reply goodsayan on January 12, 2015 11:15 am folder LXDE has changed, Thanks Jeremy! Reply Claudio on January 13, 2015 11:18 pm THANK YOU! This saved me really time! Reply Daniel on January 16, 2015 3:29 am As Jeremy was saying, with the changes to the new image for Raspbian, it also effect the per user basis. I tried to figure it out for hours why my apps were not auto starter per user and you have to change the folder ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE to ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi for it to work properly. Hopes this helps. Reply Ben on January 17, 2015 2:28 pm Thanks Jeremy – I am trying to use the user autostart (to start pipresents on startup) and it didn’t work until i created: ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart Reading the above I guess this is new – I downloaded and installed NOOBS today, 17th Jan 2015. Hope this helps. Reply Carlos on February 18, 2015 9:39 pm Thanks all, I was having issues with this as well… I had set the pi to autostart into GUI (thru raspi-config) and all the instructions never made this work!!! However, figured out that if I disabled the autostart into GUI (via raspi-config) and run the command startx, it started working… any ideas how to make it boot the pi into GUI and have auto start of an application. My second issue is that I can now see my python script trying to execute (by running startx manually), but can’t start since input() has an EOF error… so I basically want to boot to GUI and ready for keyboard input. Something relatively easy, but has been taking me several days to figure because of all the oddities of Raspian/Pi Thanks, -Carlos Reply David van Wyk on February 24, 2015 3:07 pm Hi Guys, I am busy with an application that utilises the GPIO and it needs root priviliges, but I want it to auto start on boot. Do I need something extra, as on the command line ‘sudo’? I usually have to open the current folder as root and then I can start my application by double clicking. The above code doesn’t start my application up. Thanks. Reply Howard on April 14, 2015 10:09 am I used the following command to change the file ownership to pi and switch back to root afterward. chown pi:pi [filename] Reply David van Wyk on June 7, 2015 10:15 am Howard, I am not quite with you? I have since also upgraded to the Rpi 2B, but still having trouble starting my app. Now on the Rpi 2B I cant switch a window to root user, the option was removed. So my app doesn’t even start on normal double click anymore. It only runs if I remove gpio references from the code. How do I run a GUI with GPIO (root privileges) on Rpi 2B and more especially how can I autostart the app. I changed the file ownership to root, still doesnt work. Reply Henry Hansel on February 25, 2015 12:05 pm I too have been battling this on a RPI2 running Rasbian. My app uses GPIO and tkinter so I need X running. My intention is to auto boot to desktop and then for my application to launch covering the OS like a virtual machine. Strange behavior is that after locating the path .config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/ and creating my autostart file my python program will auto launch about 50% of the time on boot. I have not been able to determine why it will not the other times? I hope that someone can finally put a nail in this, I am dead in the water with this project until I can get 100% autostart to work. Thanks for all the input. Henry Reply Henry Hansel on March 1, 2015 12:01 pm Finally, I think that I have got autostart to work 100% of the time. I had to modify my autostart file in /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart to read: @/usr/bin/python3.2/myscript.py myscript.py resides in home/pi I added python3.2 for it to work, apparently it was trying to run my python3 script with python2 even though the shebang statement at the top of the script calls for python3. I am a linux noob so any insight on why this works would be appreciated. Henry Reply Ashley Burt on March 17, 2015 8:03 pm I just put the commands I needed to autorun into the users .profile in their home directory. Worked like a champ. Reply Rebecca on April 11, 2015 4:51 pm Is it possible to have multiple python scripts set to run at the start up of the GUI? I have tried just adding in another @/usr/bin/python /home/pi/example.py line to the autostart file but it doesn’t run the second python script Reply Frank on October 6, 2015 2:35 pm I was having issues trying to get the R Pi2 to launch a website on boot I ended up making the change to this config file to make it work sudo nano /home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart It worked like a charm. I had a hard time finding this solution and i hope it helps others. Reply Sal on October 26, 2015 5:18 am Frank thank you spent hours and hours looking for this solution, editing sudo nano /home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart Worked perfect! THANKS!!!! Reply Mark Baker on October 28, 2015 3:15 pm I’ve modified /home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart adding @xfreerdp server1 to automatically start a RDP session to a terminal server. It works perfectly if I manually login as pi but as soon as I reconfigure it to automatically login as pi into the desktop it stops working. If I add @leafpad to the autostart file it works but not the @xfreerdp Any suggestions? Reply Peter Triandafillou on January 24, 2016 10:42 pm This thread has been very helpful – thanks to all the contributors. I have a question: I added a line to start an lxterminal to run my program, and it works. However, my program accesses a Sense Hat, and it needs to start with sudo to run properly. Is there a way to specify the user password in the autostart line so that it doesn’t need to be entered? I’m developing an application that would be better off without a keyboard. Thanks! Reply Alex Cahill on February 11, 2016 10:59 pm Annonyingly I took me 2 days to figure out that method 1 no longer works. https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/LXDE#Autostart “Note: If both files are present, lxsession only executes the local file as of v0.4.9” Reply Matt on February 15, 2016 8:27 pm Method should work as long as there are no local files defined. Thanks for the tip, I’ve modified the article to mention the local file take priority over the global file. Reply Peter on February 23, 2016 12:54 pm I have a small problem. I want to autostart two programs and of cause it works with mentioned method no.1. The problem is, I want to start them in two different virtuell desktops, unfortunately both programs are starting only on one desktop and I really do not find a way to start on the defined desktops. Any idea? Reply jordan on March 12, 2016 11:09 pm THANK YOU I have been trying to find a way to get this to work, and i’ve seen other tutorials like this, but only using method 1 and I could never get it to work. Method 2 worked perfectly for me. Thank you again! Reply ALI on April 10, 2016 6:39 pm Can I run a shell file placed on Desktop on reboot?? How to do that?

                   NS1:content=" Home Packages Forums Wiki Bugs AUR Download USB 3G Modem From ArchWiki Jump to: navigation, search Related articles wvdial Direct Modem Connection 3G and GPRS modems with pppd Category:Modems Tango-edit-clear.pngThis article or section needs language, wiki syntax or style improvements.Tango-edit-clear.png Reason: does not conform to Help:Style (Discuss in Talk:USB 3G Modem#) A number of mobile telephone networks around the world offer mobile internet connections over UMTS (or EDGE or GSM) using a portable USB modem device. Contents [hide] 1 Remove the PIN 2 Device identification 3 Mode switching 4 Connection 4.1 Network Manager 4.2 wvdial 4.3 netctl 4.4 sakis3g 4.5 Low connection speed 4.5.1 QoS parameter 4.5.2 Baud parameter 4.6 Monitor used bandwith 5 Reading SMS 5.1 command line script 6 Fix image quality Remove the PIN First of all use your SIM card in a normal phone and disable the PIN request if present. If the SIM card asks the PIN wvdial will not work. Failing that, you can also use mmcli to unlock the SIM card: # mmcli -i SIMNUMBER --pin=XXXX where SIMNUMBER can be found using mmcli -L and mmcli -m X. Device identification Examine the output of $ lsusb which will show the vendor and product IDs of the device. Note that some devices will show two different product IDs at different times as explained below. Mode switching Often these devices will have two modes (1) USB flash memory storage (2) USB Modem. The first mode, sometimes known as ZeroCD, is often used to deliver an internet communications program for another operating system and is generally of no interest to Linux users. Additionally some have a slot into which the user can insert an additional flash memory card. A useful utility for switching these devices into modem mode is usb_modeswitch, available in the official repositories. Udev rules are supplied with the package in /lib/udev/rules.d/40-usb_modeswitch.rules. This contains entries for many devices, which it will switch to modem mode upon insertion. When a device is switched, its product ID may change to a different value. The vendor ID will remain unchanged. This can be seen in the output of lsusb. Some devices are supported in the USB serial kernel module called &quot;option&quot; (after the Option devices, but not limited to just those) and may be used without usb_modeswitch. Udev itself included a utility called /lib/udev/modem-modeswitch. In udev 157 this was renamed to /lib/udev/mobile-action-modeswitch and morphed into a tool that only switches Mobile Action cables. For other devices use usb_modeswitch. Note: You can find an alternative way to do this base on eject command here. Connection Network Manager After installing usbutils and usb_modeswitch, you just need to install modemmanager to make the modem work with NetworkManager. Make sure both NetworkManager and ModemManager services are running, see systemd#Using units for details. Make sure mobile-broadband-provider-info and nm-connection-editor are installed. A system restart might be necessary for ModemManager to detect the USB modem. After you restart the NetworkManager-applet and plug the modem in again NetworkManager should recognize the modem in the menu without further configuration. Setting up the modem in NetworkManager is self-explanatory, you should only need the login-information provided by your network provider. Whilst running ModemManager gammu will not work. SMS and Ussd codes can be still used with modem-manager-gui. wvdial See main article: wvdial netctl Netctl can be used to establish a connection using a USB modem. An example configuration file provided by netctl is located at /etc/netctl/examples/mobile_ppp. See the netctl article for more information. sakis3g There may be the chance that the modem stick is supported by sakis3g which is an all in one command line script and automates all the steps above. Install sakis3gAUR from the AUR. Low connection speed Someone claims that the connection speed under Linux is lower than Windows: [1] A short summary for possible solutions which are not fully verified. In most of conditions, the low speed is caused by bad receiver signals and too many people in cell. But you still could use the following method to try to improve the connection speed. QoS parameter The AT+CGEQMIN and AT+CGEQREQ commands can be used to set the QoS. It is also possible to decrease and limit the connect speed. Add the following Init command in /etc/wvdial.conf: Init6 = AT+CGEQMIN=1,4,64,640,64,640 Init7 = AT+CGEQREQ=1,4,64,640,64,640 Baud parameter Baud parameter in wvdial.conf could be used to increase the connection speed. Baud = 460800 But the official Huawei E261 windows application set the Baud=9600 under Windows Vista. More verifications are needed to double check this point. Monitor used bandwith Frequently a 3G connection obtained via a mobile phone operator comes with restricted bandwidth, so that you are only allowed to use a certain bandwidth per time (e.g. 1GB per month). While it is quite straight-forward to know which type of network applications are pretty bandwidth extensive (e.g. video streaming, gaming, torrent, etc.), it may be difficult to keep an overview about overall consumed bandwidth. A number of tools are available to help with that. Two console tools are vnstat, which allows to keep track of bandwith over time, and iftop to monitor bandwidth of individual sessions. If you are a KDE user, knemo might help. All are available in the official repositories. Reading SMS This was tested on a Huawei EM770W (GTM382E) 3g card integrated into an Acer Aspire AS3810TG laptop. $ pacman -S gnokii $ mkdir -p $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gnokii Usually the configuration directory is ~/.config/gnokii. $ cp /etc/gnokiirc ~/.config/gnokii/config edit ~/.config/gnokii/config as follows: port = /dev/ttyUSB0 You may have to use a different port depending on your configuration, for example /dev/ttyUSB1 or something else: model = AT connection = serial You need to be part of the uucp group to use /dev/ttyUSB0, for example if your user is called &quot;x&quot;: # gpasswd -a x uucp $ newgrp uucp The newgrp command allows you to take advantage of the new group assignment immediately without having to logout/login. Then launch gnokii: $ xgnokii Click on the &quot;SMS&quot; icon button, a window opens up. Then click: &quot;messages-&gt;activate sms reading&quot;. Your messages will show up in the window. command line script A small command line script using gnokii to read SMS on your SIM card (not phone memory) without having to start a GUI: $ gnokii --getsms SM 0 end 2&gt;&amp;1|grep Text -A1 -B3|grep -v Text What it does: gnokii # invoke gnokii --getsms SM 0 end # read SMS from SM-memory location (=SIM card) starting at 0 and reading all occupied memory locations (&quot;end&quot;) 2&gt;&amp;1 # connect STDERR to STDOUT to make sure the output from the --getsms command can be piped to grep |grep Text # pipe output from gnokii to grep, anchoring at output containing &quot;Text&quot; -A1 -B3 # print one line after the matched pattern and three lines before the matched pattern |grep -v Text # grep result to another grep to exclude the &quot;Text&quot; line (-v for inverting the pattern) Granted this does not work very well if your SMS contains the word &quot;Text&quot;, but you may adapt the script to your liking. Fix image quality If you are getting low quality images while browsing the web over a mobile broadband connection with the hints &quot;shift+r improves the quality of this image&quot; and &quot;shift+a improves the quality of all images on this page&quot;, follow these instructions: Install tinyproxy, available in the official repositories. Edit /etc/tinyproxy/tinyproxy.conf and insert the following two lines: AddHeader &quot;Pragma&quot; &quot;No-Cache&quot; AddHeader &quot;Cache-Control&quot; &quot;No-Cache&quot; Start tinyproxy: systemctl start tinyproxy Configure your browser to use localhost:8888 as a proxy server and you are all done. This is especially useful if you are using, for example, Google Chrome which, unlike Firefox, does not allow you to modify the Pragma and Cache-Control headers.

Post navigation ← Previous Next → BeagleBone and USB GSM Stick Posted on 19/11/2012 by Mark More sysadmin than electronics today! I have an O2 USB modem and I was wondering about getting the BeagleBone hooked up to it. It would be cool to have the BeagleBone “phone home” if is was out in the field logging, or whatever. Front side of my USB GSM modem As you can see form the photo of the back-side it’s a Huawei Mobile Broadband E1752C USB modem. The back side of the Huawei Mobile Broadband E1752C USB stick It turns out to be really easy to use this (or any other USB GSM modem) with Ubuntu. It a little “old school” without a GUI to work in, but hay, command line is king after all!.. It brings back memories of using pppd and chat scripts when I used Linux to connect over a copper phone line to the “Internet!”. On the O2 network here in Ireland my /etc/ppp/peers/o2 file looks like this: debug connect &quot;/usr/sbin/chat -v -f /etc/chatscripts/o2&quot; lock local user &quot;o2&quot; password &quot;o2&quot; ttyUSB0 noauth defaultroute noipdefault usepeerdns ipcp-max-failure 5 lcp-echo-failure 5 lcp-echo-interval 30 persist #auth refuse-chap refuse-mschap refuse-mschap-v2 refuse-eap # compression novjccomp nobsdcomp noaccomp nopcomp novj noccp And my chat script looks like this: ECHO ON TIMEOUT 10 ABORT 'BUSY' ABORT 'NO ANSWER' ABORT 'ERROR' ABORT 'NO CARRIER' &quot;&quot; AT OK AT+CPIN=XXXX TIMEOUT 5 ERROR-AT-OK AT+CGDCONT=1,&quot;IP&quot;,&quot;open.internet&quot; OK &quot;ATD*99#&quot; CONNECT &quot;&quot; Nice little trick here for the PIN entry.. You need it the first time the modem boots up, but not for re-connecting the “TIMEOUT 5 ERROR-AT-OK” will allow the PIN code to fail (because it already been entered) and not stop the script. As I want to remote connect to BeagleBone, I’ve got it to send it’s IP address back to base (every time the PPP interface comes up). You will need to set up shared SSH keys between your server and the Bone to get this to work without a password. Then I created the following little script ( /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/001updateIP ): #!/bin/sh # # scp the current IP address back to base... # (MMcK 2012-11-19) # /sbin/ifconfig -a \ | awk '/inet addr/ { print $2 }' \ | awk -F: '{ print $2 }' \ &gt; /tmp/bone.ipaddr /usr/bin/scp -q /tmp/bone.ipaddr &lt;me&gt;@&lt;my server&gt;: Now every time the Bone comes online over the PPP interface I can connect to it by looking up it’s new IP address.

                   NS1:content=" Apr 5 ARDUINO UNO I/O PORT PROGRAMMING ARDUINO UNO I/O PORT PROGRAMMING Hello readers, today I will discuss with you about the three important registers that are associated with Arduino Uno (ATMEGA 328). They are PORT register, DDR (Data Direction register) and PIN register. Arduino Uno board has 3 ports namely PORTB, PORTC and PORTD. PORTB occupies pin number (8 to 13) PORTC occupies analog pins (A0 to A5) PORTD occupies digital pins (0 to 7) DDR register is used to set the direction of the PORT. Any port pin can be configured as input pin or an output pin. To understand how we can set the direction of a particular port pins let’s see some of the examples- If we write DDRB = B00111111; then PORTB pins (PB0 to PB5) are configured as output port pins. DDRB = B00000001; then PB0 is configured as output port pins and PB1 to PB5 pins are configured as input pins. So it’s quite clear that if it is required to set a port pin as i/p pin then write 0 to the corresponding port pin position in DDR register and for configuring a port pin as o/p pin then write 1 to the corresponding port pin position in DDR register. PORT register is used for assigning the value on to a particular port. For example- PORTB = B00111111; then all pins of PORTB are set to HIGH level. PORTB = B00111100; then PB0 and PB1 are reset to LOW level and PB2 to PB5 are set to HIGH level. PIN register The status of the i/p port pins can be read from the PIN register. This register can only be read and each port has its own corresponding PIN register, PORTA has PINA, PORTB has PINB and PORTC has PINC register. Now after understanding the role of different registers associated with i/o functionality of ports, let’s develop some examples to get used to the usage of these registers. Consider that PORTB has six LED’s connected to it as shown in figure below- Circuit Diagram- Figure 1 Circuit showing 6 LEDs connected to PORTB Now it is required to blink these six LEDs after every 1 second. To do this task first in the setup() function the directions of PORTB pins has to be configured as i/p pins and then in the loop() function PORTB can be assigned values. The complete code is given below- Code for blinking six led’s connected on PORTB every 1 second- void setup() { DDRB = B00111111; // Initialize PORTB data direction register PB0 to PB5 configured as o/p pins } void loop() { PORTB = B00111111; // assign value to PORTB making all pins high delay(1000); // delay of 1 sec PORTB = B00000000; // assign value to PORTB making all pins low delay(1000); // delay of 1 sec } Similarly readers can try other simple programs like led flashing pattern from right to left or from left to right using shift left (&lt;&lt;) and shift right operator (&gt;&gt;). One simple loop() body for blinking the leds from left to right can be- void loop() { int m; PORTB = B00000001; // make PB0 high delay(1000); // 1 sec delay for(m=0;m&lt;5;m++) { PORTB = PORTB&lt;&lt;1; // shift left delay(1000); // 1 sec delay } } Now let’s analyze some of the examples in which PIN register is used to read the status of a port. Assume that an active low switch is connected to pin 13 and a led is connected to pin 12 of arduino. The default state of the pin 13 is high and the default state of pin 12 is low. It is required that when switch is pressed the LED should glow and when it is released then the led should remain in the off state. The circuit diagram for demonstrating this problem is shown below- Figure 2 Circuit showing a button connected on pin 13 and an led connected on pin 12 The following arduino code can be used to read the status of a button- byte temp; // define a temporary variable to hold the status of port pins void setup() { DDRB = B00000010; // configure PB0 as i/p and PB1 as o/p pins } void loop() { temp = PINB &amp; B00000001; // check the status of port pins using simple and operation if (temp == B00000001) // check the status of temporary variable temp which stores the status of //PORTB { PORTB = B00000000; // assign this value to PORTB } // if switch is pressed then else block is executed else { PORTB = B00000010; } } So here a temporary variable temp is used to check the status of i/p and temp variable is assigned the value as- temp = PINB &amp; B00000001; If switch is not pressed then temp will have the value of B00000001 as PB0 i/p pin is high. When switch is pressed then i/p pin PB0 becomes low and so “and” operation will make temp value as B00000000. Note- Assigning a port pin value using digitalWrite() function is an easier method instead of using PORTB value assignment but if you need to set more than one pin to logic high then you need to write individual statements of digitalWrite() for individual pins and this means that all pins will not be raised to logic high at the same time though that delay is very small but can create certain performance issues when a port pin is driving a heavy load with the help of interfacing circuits. Assigning values to a complete port using port value assignment strategy can remove this delay and all the pins can be raised to logic high at the same time. THNAKS FOR READING…….

The name of the development board is ATMEL ATMEGA168PB XPLAINED MINI. I got this board few days back and implemented few of the applications that I used to develop on other platforms using different microcontroller. ATMEL has done great work in bringing a new microcontroller based development board that is Arduino compatible and cost less than 10$, isn’t it great. The development board is based on microcontroller ATMega168PB which can be called as the heart of the entire development board but there is one more thing which makes it even more special and that is the presence of In Circuit Debugger which is a requirement of today’s Embedded designers so that the task of debugging can be performed in real time on the actual h/w. A microcontroller based development board costing less than 10$ and with the ICD (In Circuit Debugger) is a very good choice for developing microcontroller based applications. Fig.1 below shows pictorial view of the ATMega168PB Xplained Mini Evaluation Kit from ATMEL:- Fig.1 ATMega168PB Xplained Mini Evaluation Kit The top view showing different pins on board is shown below in Fig.2- Fig.2 Top view of the evaluation kit showing different pins The following breakout I/O port pins are visible onboard:- PORTD pins PD0 to PD7 (8 pins) PORTC pins PC0 to PC5 (6 pins) PORTB pins PB0 to PB5 (6 pins) However microcontroller ATMEGA168PB has PORTC pins PC0 to PC6 (pin number 23 to 29), PORTD pins PD0 to PD7 (pin number 30, 31, 32, 1, 2, 9, 10, 11) PORTB pins PB0 to PB7 (pin number 12 to 17 and pin number 7 and 8) and PORTE pins PE0 to PE3 (pin number 3, 6, 19, 22). So it’s clear that every pin of the microcontroller is not seen on the board and if some application demands the use of these left out pins then some arrangement must be made in order to bring these pin out connections from the microcontroller. Apart from the I/O port pins there are some other pins that are available like AREF for setting the reference voltage for the A/D conversion and dedicated ISP connection pins are also available in order to program the microcontroller using external ISP programmer. Breakout pins for VCC and GND connections are also available for connections with the external peripheral devices. This is very useful because if the board has enough number of GND and VCC pins then it becomes easy to interface number of peripherals taking the supply voltage from the common VCC and having common GND. If there is not enough number of pins available for GND and VCC then the h/w designer either combines different supply voltage wires together or then route it to the common VCC pin or they make a separate breakout board for connections of VCC and GND pins. It’s good that the board has enough number of VCC and GND breakout pins on board. It is a pint to note that some of the port pins have some special functionality besides functioning as I/O pins. The special features include ADC channels, SPI pins, I2C pins etc. Readers can refer to the detailed pin diagram shown in Fig.3 below for the same:- Fig.3 ATMega168PB Microcontroller ATMega168PB microcontroller has 16KB of flash memory, 512 bytes of EEPROM, 1KB RAM. The total pin count is 32. The detailed features are given below for the reference of the readers:- The description of the features is extracted from the data sheet of the ATMega168PB microcontroller. After understanding the features and pin diagram of the ATMega168PB microcontrollers, let’s develop a code for blinking the led connected on board on pin number PB5. For developing the hex file I have used Atmel Studio software, again a great job from Atmel. The software can be used as an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for developing applications on all the AVR architecture based microcontrollers and also for developing applications for the ARM based MCU’s from ATMEL. I will surely post a separate tutorial for the instructions on using the Atmel studio software for developing an application. The code given below is tested on the kit and it works fine in which led connected to port pin PB5 blinks after every 1 second. The comments are also given in the code for better understanding of the readers. Code- #include &lt;avr/io.h&gt; // header file #define F_CPU 8000000 // define the clock frequency as 8MHZ #include &lt;util/delay.h&gt; // header file so as to use _delay_ms() function in the code int main(void) // main function starts from here { DDRB = (1&lt;&lt;5); // configure PB5 as o/p pin PORTB = (1&lt;&lt;5); // enable the pull up connected on PB5 while(1) { PORTB ^= (1&lt;&lt;5); // toggle PB5 using xor operation _delay_ms(1000); // give delay of 1000ms } } Brief Explanation of the code- First include the relevant header files in the program, I have included avr/io.h and util/delay.h header files. Header files are always included at the top of the program and have specific purpose. util/delay.h contains the definition of the delay function and in order to use the built in delay function (_delay_ms( ) ) this header file must be included in the code. Avr/io.h is included to use the I/O functionality of the microcontroller. It is necessary to define the clock frequency in the code. It’s not a mandatory thing to do but a good practice that must be followed by the s/w designers. Here the definition of clock frequency is given by- #define F_CPU 8000000 // Indicating the clock frequency of 8MHz. In the main function two important registers are utilized ie. DDRB (Data Direction Register of PORTB) and PORTB register DDRB register is used for configuring the PORTB pins as i/p or o/p. If 1 is written to a particular position of DDRB register then that port pin is configured as o/p pin and if 0 is written then that particular port pin is configured as i/p pin. Since the on board LED is connected to PORTB pin 5 and so the instruction for configuring it as o/p can be written as- DDRB = (1&lt;&lt;5) // configures PB5 as o/p pin Weak pull ups are available internally on the port pins and they can be enabled. Here the pull up of PORTB pin PB5 is enabled by writing PORTB = (1&lt;&lt;5) //enables pull up on PB5 In the infinite loop the blinking action is performed by utilizing the XOR operation. The instruction for toggling the port pin PB5 is given as- PORTB ^= (1&lt;&lt;5); // toggle PB5 using xor operation Note: Logic 1 XOR Logic 1 is Logic 0 Logic 1 XOR Logic 0 is Logic 1. The LED remains in a particular state for the time delay defined by _delay_ms( ) function. Here time delay of 1 second is specified using the instruction _delay_ms(1000) indicating 1000 ms delay. So reader’s that’s it with the LED blinking code, now download ATMEL Studio on your System, get ATMega168PB Xplained Mini Evaluation Kit and start experimenting.

DDRB = B00000001; then PB0 is configured as output port pins and PB1 to PB5 pins are configured as input pins. So it’s quite clear that if it is required to set a port pin as i/p pin then write 0 to the corresponding port pin position in DDR register and for configuring a port pin as o/p pin then write 1 to the corresponding port pin position in DDR register. PORT register is used for assigning the value on to a particular port. For example- PORTB = B00111111; then all pins of PORTB are set to HIGH level. PORTB = B00111100; then PB0 and PB1 are reset to LOW level and PB2 to PB5 are set to HIGH level. PIN register The status of the i/p port pins can be read from the PIN register. This register can only be read and each port has its own corresponding PIN register, PORTA has PINA, PORTB has PINB and PORTC has PINC register. Now after understanding the role of different registers associated with i/o functionality of ports, let’s develop some examples to get used to the usage of these registers. Consider that PORTB has six LED’s connected to it as shown in figure below- Circuit Diagram- Figure 1 Circuit showing 6 LEDs connected to PORTB Now it is required to blink these six LEDs after every 1 second. To do this task first in the setup() function the directions of PORTB pins has to be configured as i/p pins and then in the loop() function PORTB can be assigned values. The complete code is given below- Code for blinking six led’s connected on PORTB every 1 second- void setup() { DDRB = B00111111; // Initialize PORTB data direction register PB0 to PB5 configured as o/p pins } void loop() { PORTB = B00111111; // assign value to PORTB making all pins high delay(1000); // delay of 1 sec PORTB = B00000000; // assign value to PORTB making all pins low delay(1000); // delay of 1 sec } Similarly readers can try other simple programs like led flashing pattern from right to left or from left to right using shift left (&lt;&lt;) and shift right operator (&gt;&gt;). One simple loop() body for blinking the leds from left to right can be- void loop() { int m; PORTB = B00000001; // make PB0 high delay(1000); // 1 sec delay for(m=0;m&lt;5;m++) { PORTB = PORTB&lt;&lt;1; // shift left delay(1000); // 1 sec delay } } Now let’s analyze some of the examples in which PIN register is used to read the status of a port. Assume that an active low switch is connected to pin 13 and a led is connected to pin 12 of arduino. The default state of the pin 13 is high and the default state of pin 12 is low. It is required that when switch is pressed the LED should glow and when it is released then the led should remain in the off state. The circuit diagram for demonstrating this problem is shown below- Figure 2 Circuit showing a button connected on pin 13 and an led connected on pin 12 The following arduino code can be used to read the status of a button- byte temp; // define a temporary variable to hold the status of port pins void setup() { DDRB = B00000010; // configure PB0 as i/p and PB1 as o/p pins } void loop() { temp = PINB &amp; B00000001; // check the status of port pins using simple and operation if (temp == B00000001) // check the status of temporary variable temp which stores the status of //PORTB { PORTB = B00000000; // assign this value to PORTB } // if switch is pressed then else block is executed else { PORTB = B00000010; } } So here a temporary variable temp is used to check the status of i/p and temp variable is assigned the value as- temp = PINB &amp; B00000001; If switch is not pressed then temp will have the value of B00000001 as PB0 i/p pin is high. When switch is pressed then i/p pin PB0 becomes low and so “and” operation will make temp value as B00000000. Note- Assigning a port pin value using digitalWrite() function is an easier method instead of using PORTB value assignment but if you need to set more than one pin to logic high then you need to write individual statements of digitalWrite() for individual pins and this means that all pins will not be raised to logic high at the same time though that delay is very small but can create certain performance issues when a port pin is driving a heavy load with the help of interfacing circuits.

SMS based control of appliances is a very popular application and the one with very much utility for different domains. Sometimes it becomes difficult to imagine and believe that your mobile phone can act as a remote for the commonly used home appliances and you are always connected to your home through your mobile phone no matter in which part of the world you are. SMS service can be used to control different appliances of our home and for that it is quite obvious that there must be an intelligent system installed at home which will receive the sms, read its content and finally will be able to perform the desired action for switching on/off the appliances. This type of intelligent system can be easily designed using microcontroller, gsm modem and some electro-mechanical relays. Fig. below shows a simple block diagram of the home automation system design using arduino uno development platform. Block Diagram Working GSM module (SIM900) is interfaced with arduino using serial pins (0 and 1). AT commands are sent to gsm modem for configuring it in sms mode and also to route the new incoming message to the serial reception pin of the arduino. The incoming message is decoded by the arduino and is compared with the predefined codes. If the match is found then the corresponding action for that code will be performed by the arduino. The following codes are used- D1N----------device 1 on D1F----------device 1 off D2N----------device 2 on D2F----------device 2 off DAN----------all devices on DAF----------all devices off If the received message contents are D1N then relay 1 will be triggered through BC547 transistor and device 1 is switched on, here transistor BC547 acts as a relay driver and it drives the SPDT relay. Similarly for other codes the corresponding programmed functions are performed. RELAY A relay is an electrically controllable switch widely used in industrial controls, automobiles, and appliances. Fig. below shows a SPDT relay- As shown in the above figure a SPDT relay has 5 terminals out of which two are for the coil, one for common, one for normally open contact and one for normally closed contact. When the coil terminal is energized then due to the magnetic force the common terminal contact is pulled from normally closed position to normally open position. A simple npn transistor can be used to energize the coil terminals of the relay. Fig. below shows the connection diagram of BC547 transistor with the SPDT relay for controlling a lamp. A button is connected at the base terminal with a resistor R2. When the button is pressed then the emitter base junction gets forward biased and transistor switches to “ON” state. In this state the relay coil gets energized and the common terminal of the relay gets shifted to the normally open terminal where a lamp is connected. The common terminal is connected to the voltage at which it is desired to operate the device which is connected on the normally open terminal. So the device will remain in the “ON” state till the button is in the pressed state. When the button is released then the emitter base junction will not get the enough forward bias voltage to turn the transistor to “ON” state and because of this the transistor switches to off state and the relay coil will get de- energized. The magnetic force collapses and the common terminal of the relay is pulled back to the normally closed position and the device switches to “OFF” state. AT COMMANDS to initialize GSM modem AT+CNMI, New Message Indications to TE This command selects the procedure, how receiving of new messages from the network is indicated to the DTE when DTE is active. AT+CNMI=[&lt;mode&gt;[,&lt;mt&gt;[,&lt;bm&gt;[,&lt;ds&gt;[,&lt;bfr&gt;]]]]] Here I have used the command- AT+CNMI=2,2,0,0,0 &lt;mode&gt; value here is 2 which indicates buffer unsolicited result codes in the modem when modem-DTE link is reserved (e.g. in on-line data mode) and flush them to the DTE after reservation. Otherwise forward them directly to the DTE. The rules for storing received sms depends on its coding scheme, preferred memory storage (using command at+cpms) settings and the value of &lt;mt&gt; field that is specified in the at+cnmi command. Here I have used &lt;mt&gt; field value as 2 and this indicates that SMS-DELIVERs (except class 2 messages and messages in the message waiting indication group (store message)) are routed directly to the DTE using unsolicited result code +CMT: &lt;bm&gt; field is et to 0 and this indicates that no CBM (Cell Broadcast Message) indications are routed to the DTE. &lt;ds&gt; field is also set to 0 and this indicates that no SMS-STATUS-REPORTs are routed to the DTE. &lt;bfr&gt; field is set to 0 and this means modem buffer of unsolicited result codes defined within this command is flushed to the DTE when &lt;mode&gt; 1 - 3 is entered (OK response shall be given before flushing the codes) AT+CMGF, SMS Format AT+CMGF=&lt;mode&gt; mode = 0: PDU mode mode = 1: Text mode Here I have used the command AT+CMGF=1 and this configures the modem in the sms mode.

For sending the SMS using android mobile phone an application can be designed for easy user interface. The system can also be equipped to give feedback messages indicating the status of all the appliances on demand and also on the successful execution of the issued command. I will discuss the app designing fundamentals for sending the SMS in my upcoming articles.

For example take the case of a simple temperature monitoring system in which it is desired to get a notification SMS on a mobile phone when temperature value exceeds 70 degree celcius or getting a SMS notification on breach of security. All these type of applications can be very easily tackled with the help of a GSM modem. Two most popular GSM modules that are used in embedded applications are SIM300 and SIM900. In this article I will explain the concept of interfacing 8051 microcontroller with SIM300 GSM module. Fig. below shows a SIM300 GSM module- AT commands are used to control GSM modem, AT is the abbreviation for “attention” and microcontroller can interact with the GSM modem by using AT commands. AT command set is very huge and here I will be explaining few AT commands that are quite often used in various embedded system applications. The general syntax of AT command is – AT &lt;command name&gt; &lt;carriage return&gt; Every AT command begins with a prefix AT and it ends with a carriage return. AT commands that are used in SMS and calling applications are given below- • ATà TO INITIATE THE GSM MODEM • ATD98XXXXXXX;à THIS WILL ESTABLISH THE CALL TO MOBILE NUMBER (98XXXXXXXX) • ATAàTO ANSWER THE CALL • ATHàTO DISCONNECT THE CALL • AT+CMGF=1àINITITATE THE GSM MODEM IN TEXT MODE • AT+CMGS=“98XXXXXXXX” &gt;TYPE YOUR MESSAGE HERE CRTL+ZàTO SEND MESSAGE • AT+CMGR=MESSAGE NUMBER IN INBOX MESSAGE AT POSITION MESSAGE NUMBER WILL BE DISPLAYED If the AT command given by microcontroller to GSM modem is executed successfully by the GSM modem then OK return code will be given back to microcontroller otherwise error code will be returned back which will indicate the cause of unsuccessful execution of the given command. Circuit Diagram- Working Details- SIM300 GSM modem is interfaced with 8051 microcontroller via RXD and TXD pins (P3.0 and P3.1 respectively). In order to send sms via GSM modem it is required to configure the GSM modem using AT commands. Readers must have good understanding of the serial communication programming fundamentals and if you are not aware of the same then you are recommended to go through my other post on “Serial Communication in 8051 Microcontroller”. As shown in the circuit diagram there is a push button connected on port pin P1.0 of 8051 microcontroller. Port pin P1.0 is configured as i/p pin and is pulled up using a 10K resistor. Default state of pin P1.0 is logic ‘1’ and when push button is pressed then the state of port pin P1.0 goes to logic ‘0’. It is required to send the SMS with the message body as “hello sir” to a predefined mobile phone number whenever push button is pressed. The code for this is given below- Code- #include&lt;reg51.h&gt; #include&lt;stdio.h&gt; sbit sw=P1^0; // delay subroutine starts here void delay() { int i,j; for(j=0;j&lt;40;j++) for(i=0;i&lt;15000;i++); } // main function starts here void main() { sw=1; // initialize P1^0 as an i/p pin if(sw==0) // if switch is pressed then send the SMS { TMOD=0X20; // Timer 1 in mode2 TH1=0XFD; // TH1 is loaded for 9600bps baud rate generation SCON=0X50; // Serial communication in mode 1 with receive enable TR1=1; // Start Timer TI=1; // Since printf( ) is used so TI flag has to be raised printf(&quot;at&quot;); // initiate the GSM modem printf(&quot;\n&quot;); printf(&quot;\r&quot;); delay(); printf(&quot;at+cmgf=1&quot;); // initiate GSM modem in text mode printf(&quot;\n&quot;); printf(&quot;\r&quot;); delay(); printf(&quot;at+cmgs=\&quot;098XXXXXXXX\&quot;&quot;); // send sms to the specified mobile number printf(&quot;\n&quot;); printf(&quot;\r&quot;); delay(); printf(&quot;Hello Sir&quot;); // body of the SMS delay(); SBUF=0x1A; // ASCII code for ctrl+z while(TI==0); // wait for the transmission to complete TI=0; // clear the transmit interrupt flag delay(); } } The code is tested on Proteus simulation platform and the snap shot of the commands that are sent to the virtual terminal from the 8051 microcontroller is shown below- Caution: During testing on Proteus platform make sure that you set the clock frequency of crystal oscillator as 11.0592 MHz, Otherwise baud rate mismatch will happen and will cause the erroneous interpretation of the instructions sent by 8051 microcontroller.

Bluetooth technology is very popular these days and almost all smart phones have this feature. In this work I am designing a robot which will have a Bluetooth module for communication with the smart phone. HC05 is one of the most popular serial Bluetooth module available and it can be directly interfaced with any microcontroller. Here I am using 8051 microcontroller which is interfaced with HC05 bluetooth module and L293D motor driver IC. The block diagram of the project is shown below- HC05 Bluetooth module Specifications- Bluetooth protocol: Bluetooth Specification v2.0+EDR Frequency: 2.4GHz ISM band Power supply: +3.3VDC 50mA Modulation: GFSK (Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying) Emission power: 4dBm, Class 2 Sensitivity: -84dBm at 0.1% BER Speed: Asynchronous: 2.1Mbps (Max) / 160 kbps Synchronous: 1Mbps/1Mbps Security: Authentication and encryption Profiles: Bluetooth serial port Power supply: +3.3VDC 50mA Working temperature: -20 +75 Centigrade Dimension: 26.9mm x 13mm x 2.2 mm The serial o/p of the Bluetooth module will be received by 8051 microcontroller which has been programmed to receive the data serially. The received data from the Bluetooth module is compared with the predefined data by 8051 microcontroller and if the match is found then the required action will be performed. If serially ‘1’ is received then the robot will move forward If serially ‘2’ is received then the robot will move backward If serially ‘3’ is received then the robot will move towards right If serially ‘4’ is received then the robot will move towards left If serially ‘5’ is received then the robot will stop L293D Motor Driver IC It is one of the most widely used dc motor driver IC and is available in 16 pin DIP package. Motor needs high current i/p signal which cannot be provided by microcontroller directly and so in between microcontroller and dc motor a motor driver IC is required for converting a low current control signal into a high current signal which can drive the dc motor. L293D is a dual H bridge IC and it performs the job of current amplification. Two dc motors can be easily driven in any direction using L293D IC. It has two H bridge’s which works independently to control the dc motor and that’s why the name dual H bridge is given to it. It is a known fact that if it is required to change the direction of rotation of dc motor one has to change the direction of flow of current and this can be easily achieved by reversing the polarity of applied voltage. Fig. below shows the H bridge using switches- Fig. H bridge using switches The following situations arise- If switches S1, S4 are closed and S2, S3 are open then the motor will rotate in clock wise direction. If S2, S3 are closed and S1, S4 are open then the motor will rotate in the anti clockwise direction. If S2, S4 are closed and S1, S3 are open or vice versa the it will create a direct path b/w power supply and ground leading to short circuit condition and this must be avoided. If S1, S2 are closed and S3, S4 are open or vice versa then there will be no difference in potential across the two ends of the motor and so it will not rotate. The pin diagram of L293D motor driver IC is shown below- IN1, IN2, IN3, IN4 are connected to microcontroller, motor M1 is connected b/w pin number 3 and 6 and similarly the other motor M2 is connected b/w pin number 11 and 14. EN1 and EN2 are two enable pins for the buffers which are there inside the IC. To enable the buffers EN1 and EN2 are required to be connected to +5V. Vs is motor supply voltage pin and this is required to be connected to the voltage at which motors are required to be operate, if it is required to operate the motors on 12V then this pin must be connected to the +12V power supply. Pin numbers 4, 5, 12, 13 are connected to Ground. Pin number 16 is Vss and is connected to +5V supply. In this work IN1 is connected to P2.0, IN2 is connected to P2.1, IN3 is connected to P2.2 and IN4 is connected to P2.3 of the 8051 microcontroller. Circuit Diagram- Code- The code for the robot contol is given below- #include&lt;reg51.h&gt; // define the o/p ports to be connected to L293D sbit op1=P2^0; sbit op2=P2^1; sbit op3=P2^2; sbit op4=P2^3; // temp is a variable used here for storing the serially received data byte unsigned char temp; //main program begins from here void main() { // initialization commands for serial communication TMOD=0x20; TH1=0XFD; SCON=0X50; TR1=1; // infinite loop starts from this point for serial data reception while(1) { while(RI==0); // wait until some data byte is received serially temp=SBUF; // store the data byte in the temporary variable RI=0; // clear te RI flag for next data byte reception // now put comparative statements using if loop if(temp=='1') // move the robot forward { op1=1; op2=0; op3=1; op4=0; } if(temp=='2') // move the robot backward { op1=0; op2=1; op3=0; op4=1; } if(temp=='3') // move the robot towards right { op1=1; op2=0; op3=0; op4=0; } if(temp=='4') // move the robot towards left { op1=0; op2=0; op3=1; op4=0; } if(temp=='5') // stop the robot { op1=0; op2=0; op3=0; op4=0; } } } Android App for controlling the Robot The App is designed using MIT App Inventor. The screen shot of the MIT app inventor designer window is shown below- In MIT app inventors block window the entire logic is designed. To set up the Bluetooth connection he following blocks are required to be connected- To send ‘1’ on button 1 click the following blocks are connected- Similarly one can connect the blocks for the actions that are required to be performed on the click of the remaining buttons. The app is tested in the emulator as well as on the hardware, the screen shot of the emulator is shown below- Note- 1.The distance within which the robot can be controlled is around 10 meters and this is because of the range limitation of the bluetooth device. 2. The bluetooth of the mobile phone must be in the on condition and mobile phone must be paired up with the HC05 bluetooth module before starting the android app for controlling the robot. Thats it, Now arrange the required stuff and make your own bluetooth controlled robot using Android...

Proteus software now also supports Arduino simulations, It’s a great news for all those who use proteus software for simulating microcontroller based applications. Three Arduino boards are currently supported by proteus software- Arduino Uno R3 Arduino MEGA2560 R3 Arduino MEGA1280 You first need to add the arduino library files in the proteus library. Download Arduino proteus library and extract these two files- ARDUINO.IDX, ARDUINO.LIB Copy these files and paste them in the location- C:\Archivos de programa\Hielazo Electronics\Proteus 7 Professional\LIBRARY That’s it now you are ready to use Arduino in Proteus, yes it’s that simple. Now I will discuss with you Arduino code for blinking an led connected to pin 13 and its simulation on proteus- Step 1- Write the Arduino code in Arduino IDE for blinking an led as given below- void setup() { pinMode(13,OUTPUT); // configure pin 13 as output } void loop() { digitalWrite(13,HIGH); // make pin 13 high delay(1000); // delay of 1 sec digitalWrite(13,LOW); // make pin 13 low delay(1000); // give delay of 1 sec } Step 2- For generating hex file click on Files and then Preferences Click OK Step 3- Now compile your Arduino code (Ctrl+R) to generate the hex file. Step 4- Copy the path of the hex file generated above, here in this case the path is- C:\Users\DUTTA\AppData\Local\Temp\build1767933099525274361.tmp\ledblink.cpp.hex Step 5- Open proteus software and in the part search option type- arduino uno Select ARDUINO UNO R3 and click OK Step 6- Now connect an led to pin 13 as shown in the circuit diagram below- Step 7- Double click on Arduino Uno, a new window will pop up and in this window paste the path of hex file copied in step 4 a s shown below- Click OK button Step 8- Click on play button in proteus and see the effect. Led connected on pin 13 will start blinking every 1 sec. A proteus snap shot during run time is shown below- That’s it……… Now try simulating your Arduino applications in Proteus.

UMESH DUTTA Posted 2nd November 2014 by Umesh Dutta 1 View comments Oct 25 Electronic Voting Machine Using Arduino VOTING MACHINE USING ARDUINO Hello readers, before I give you a brief about the topic that I am going to discuss with you today, I would like to share with you a very small story. Few days back I was posted on Election duty as a presiding officer and this news was not less than an earthquake for me but then a senior colleague of mine told me that one should do it at least once in a life time. I went for it and believe me it is really tough and demanding duty. I spent two days away from home and during that time there was one thing which was more precious than my own life, Can you guess what that thing was? It was the Electronic Voting Machine (EVM). Now after spending two days with this machine I thought I should also design a one for my own use and today I will discuss with you the design of EVM using Arduino. Generally EVM has two parts- Control Unit Ballot Unit Control unit stores all the votes in the memory and is generally battery operated. Control unit also contains important buttons like result, close, print, clear. Ballot unit contains buttons of the contesting parties. A connecting cable is used for connecting ballot unit with the control unit. Fig. below shows a pictorial block diagram of the EVM machine that I have designed. Three buttons are provided for the three contesting parties (PARTY-A , PARTY-B, PARTY-C). Voters can use these buttons to vote for their party. So these three buttons are accessible to the voters. Voters are not given the access of the rest of the four buttons. Total button can be pressed any time to get the count of the total number of votes that are polled so far. Close button if pressed closes the voting process and if this button is pressed then PARTY-A, B and C buttons will become in effective and pressing of these three buttons will not have any effect on the system. Once close button is pressed, Result button can be pressed to check the results of the poll. One Result button is pressed the machine will tell you the exact number of votes that are polled for each of the three contesting parties and it will also tell the result of the poll that is which party has won the election. The machine is programmed to also indicate the vote difference b/w the winning party and the first runner up party. In case tie happens b/w any two parties, or b/w all three contesting parties then the machine will show the tie result on the lcd screen. Clear button is also provided and if this button is pressed then entire memory of the machine gets empty and all the stored vote count becomes zero. So clear and total button can be pressed any time during the voting process and if these buttons are pressed corresponding action that is programmed into the system will happen. Close button must be pressed before result button is pressed to get the result. The vote count is saved in the on chip EEPROM of the Arduino and so if power cut occurs then also the votes that are entered into the system will remain safe and again when the system is powered up the voting will begin from the previous state. The circuit diagram drawn on proteus software is shown below- All the buttons are connected to the digital pins of the arduino except for one (Clear button) which is connected to analog pin A0. Though clear button is connected to analog channel pin A0 it actually is working as a digital pin. PC0/ADC0 is the name of pin A0 so A to D conversion channel is an alternative functionality of this pin and it surely can behave as a normal digital input/output pin. 16*2 LCD display is interfaced with arduino to display the information to the user. The software code was written in arduino IDE and was tested both on proteus software and on actual hardware and it worked perfectly in both these cases. The entire software code of the Electronic Voting Machine is given below- Code- #include&lt;LiquidCrystal.h&gt; // lcd library #include &lt;EEPROM.h&gt; //EEPROM library LiquidCrystal lcd(13,12,11,10,9,8); // lcd control and data lines // button pin definitions int result=5; int closed=6; int total=7; int clearbutton=A0; int a=4; int b=3; int c=2; // temporary variables used in program int v1; int v2; int v3;

// v3 stores the vote count of party C pinMode(a,INPUT); // declaration of buttons as input pinMode(b,INPUT); pinMode(c,INPUT); pinMode(total,INPUT); pinMode(closed,INPUT); pinMode(result,INPUT); pinMode(clearbutton,INPUT); digitalWrite(a,HIGH); //default status of buttons when not pressed is high digitalWrite(b,HIGH); digitalWrite(c,HIGH); digitalWrite(total,HIGH); digitalWrite(closed,HIGH); digitalWrite(result,HIGH); digitalWrite(clearbutton,HIGH);

UMESH DUTTA Posted 25th October 2014 by Umesh Dutta 5 View comments Oct 24 Password Protected System Using Arduino Password Protected System Using Arduino Hello readers, in this article I am going to discuss with you the fundamentals and programming art involved behind the design of password protected systems. These systems are very commonly used in our day to day life like in ATM machines, Electronic safe lock, door lock etc. These systems in common involve keypad input unit for entering the password and a display unit (generally an lcd display unit) for visual display of information, some switching mechanism to activate the motors in case of locks and a programmed microcontroller that will process the input information and take the appropriate action. So in order to design these systems the designer must have a good knowledge of programming for interfacing these peripherals with the microcontroller. So before I start explaining you all these concepts lets define an aim that is required to be achieved. Aim- To design a password protected system based on Arduino. The system will have a 16*2 lcd display for visual display of information, an led for indication and a 4*3 keypad for entering the information. If correct password is entered by the user then the lcd should display correct password and led should glow for 3 seconds. If user enters an incorrect password then lcd should show access denied and if user enters an incorrect password 3 times consecutively then system should lock. Now the aim is quite clear and for achieving it the first step is to understand how 4*3 keypad works. Fig. below shows how a 4*3 keypad can be constructed using micro switch:- It has 4 rows denoted here by r1, r2, r3, r4 and 3 columns denoted here by c1, c2, c3. Pictorial view of 4*3 keypad used in proteus is shown below- Every number has a unique column number and a unique row number for example digit ‘9’ has row number r3 and column number c3, similarly for digit ‘4’ row number is r2 and column number is c1. Whenever a key is pressed the row and column number corresponding to that digit will get shorted and so if we want to identify that which key is pressed, we just need to identify the row and column numbers that gets shorted. Fig. below shows one such case- The circuit diagram drawn in proteus is shown below- In programming declare all the column pins as inputs and all row pins as output. pinMode(r1,OUTPUT); pinMode(r2,OUTPUT); pinMode(r3,OUTPUT); pinMode(r4,OUTPUT); pinMode(c1,INPUT); pinMode(c2,INPUT); pinMode(c3,INPUT); Ground all the rows and make all column pins high.

Fig. below shows the run time snap shot when correct password was entered. Access Granted message is printed on the lcd display and led connected to pin number 13 remains on for 3 seconds and then it goes to off state. When wrong password is entered 3 times then the system will be locked and user needs to press reset button so that system begins executing program from the start. The snap shot under no more trials condition is given below- This project demonstrates the concepts used in designing password protected systems using Arduino. This idea can be extended to meet your demands and I hope that after reading this article you will be in a position to do just that and if not then don’t panic your help is just one click away.

UMESH DUTTA Posted 24th October 2014 by Umesh Dutta 0 Add a comment Oct 24 ARDUINO SERIAL COMMUNICATION Serial Communication in Arduino Arduino UNO has a built in UART for serial communication. Rx and TX pins (0 &amp; 1 respectively) in Arduino Uno can be used for communicating data serially with any peripheral device (like Bluetooth, GSM, GPS etc.). There are some built in functions that readers should understand before writing Arduino code for serial data transmission and reception. Some of the commonly used functions in serial data transmission and reception are discussed below- Serial.println() Prints data to the serial port as human-readable ASCII text followed by a carriage return character (ASCII 13, or '\r') and a newline character (ASCII 10, or '\n'). Syntax Serial.println(val) Serial.println(val, format) Parameters val: the value to print - any data type format: specifies the number base (for integral data types) or number of decimal places (for floating point types) Returns size_t (long): println() returns the number of bytes written, though reading that number is optional Example- Serial.println(“UMESH DUTTA”) will transmit UMESH DUTTA through the Tx pin of Arduino Uno. Serial.println(78, HEX) gives &quot;4E&quot; Serial.print() Syntax Serial.print(val) Serial.print(val, format) Parameters val: the value to print - any data type format: specifies the number base (for integral data types) or number of decimal places (for floating point types) Returns size_t (long): print() returns the number of bytes written, though reading that number is optional. For example- Serial.print(78, BIN) gives &quot;1001110&quot; Serial.println(1.23456, 2) gives &quot;1.23&quot; Serial.print(&quot;INDIA&quot;) gives &quot;INDIA&quot; Serial.write() This function writes binary data to the serial port. This data is sent as a byte or series of bytes. Syntax Serial.write(val) Serial.write(str) Serial.write(buf, len) Parameters val: a value to send as a single byte str: a string to send as a series of bytes buf: an array to send as a series of bytes len: the length of the buffer Returns byte write() will return the number of bytes written, though reading that number is optional Serial.write(32); // send a byte with the value 32 int bytesSent = Serial.write(“Delhi”); //send the string “Delhi” and return the length of the string. Serial.begin() Syntax Serial.begin(speed) Serial.begin(speed, config) Description Sets the data rate in bits per second (baud) for serial data transmission. For communicating with the computer, use one of these rates: 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 14400, 19200, 28800, 38400, 57600, or 115200. You can, however, specify other rates - for example, to communicate over pins 0 and 1 with a component that requires a particular baud rate. An optional second argument configures the data, parity, and stop bits. The default is 8 data bits, no parity, one stop bit. Example- Serial.begin(9600); // specifies 9600bpds baud rate for communication of data Serial.available() Syntax Serial.available() Description Get the number of bytes (characters) available for reading from the serial port. This is the data that's already arrived and stored in the serial receive buffer (which holds 64 bytes). Example- If some serial data is received and some action is required to be performed at that point of time then the coding can take the following form- if (Serial.available()&gt;0) { ………….do something…………. } Serial.read() Syntax Serial.read() Decription Reads incoming serial data. Returns the first byte of incoming serial data available (or -1 if no data is available) Example- if (Serial.available()&gt;0) { temp = Serial.read(); // reads the serially received data and stores it in temporary variable temp } Serial.end() Syntax Serial.end() Description Disables serial communication, allowing the RX and TX pins to be used for general input and output. To re-enable serial communication, call Serial.begin(). There are some other functions that are associated with serial communication and for understanding the left out functions I recommend you to refer the below given link- http://arduino.cc/ Now after understanding most of the functions that are associated with serial communication in Arduino Uno, I will discuss with you some of the programming examples and after going through these examples you will get the answer of question - Where to use which function? Problem1- Two led’s are connected to pin number 13 (led1) and 12(led2) of arduino uno. If serial data ‘1’ is received then led1 should glow, led2 should remain off. If serial data ‘2’ is received then led2 should glow, led1 should remain off. If serial data ‘3’ is received then both led1 and led2 should remain on. If serial data ‘4’ is received then both led1 and led2 should remain off. Circuit Diagram in proteus- Code- char temp; void setup() { Serial.begin(9600); // Baud rate of 9600bps pinMode(12,OUTPUT); //pin 12 declared as output pinMode(13,OUTPUT); // pin 13 declared as output delay(10); // delay of 10ms } void loop() { while(!Serial.available()); // stay on this line if no data is received serially if(Serial.available()&gt;0) // check if some data is available to be read { temp=Serial.read(); // read the incoming serial data byte and store in temp if(temp=='1') { digitalWrite(13,HIGH); digitalWrite(12,LOW); } if(temp=='2') { digitalWrite(13,LOW); digitalWrite(12,HIGH); } if(temp=='3') { digitalWrite(13,HIGH); digitalWrite(12,HIGH); } if(temp=='4') { digitalWrite(13,LOW); digitalWrite(12,LOW); } } The above given code was tested in proteus simulation software and on actual hardware. The code worked perfectly fine in both the cases. A snap shot of proteus simulation during run time is shown below- Caution- Take Crystal frequency of 16MHz in proteus and for that connect a crystal oscillator b/w pin 9 and 10. Double click on Arduino and a new window will pop up. In this window make sure that clock Frequence is 16MHz ad CKSEL Fuses is set at (0000)Ext. Clock. A snap shot of these settings is given below- Problem 2 LM 35 temperature sensor output is connected to analog channel A0 of Arduino Uno. Show the digital output of the temperature on virtual terminal of proteus (Send the temperature readings serially after every 1 second). Circuit diagram- Code- float value; void setup() { Serial.begin(9600); // begin serial communication with baud rate of 9600bps } void loop() { Serial.print(&quot;temperature:&quot;);//print string temperature on serial port value=analogRead(A0); // read the analog voltage of channel A0 value = ((value * 5000.0)/1024.0)/10.0;// software caliberation Serial.println(value,2); // print the temperature serially with 2 decimal places delay(1000); // delay of 1 second } A snap shot during proteus simulation is shown below- I hope that these examples will prove to be useful for the readers in grasping the programming concepts of Arduino serial communication. These fundamentals will be required when you perform GSM module (SIM900) interfacing with arduino for SMS sending or receiving applications, GPS, Bluetooth and many other applications that require the use of serial communication. I will post the articles on all these real time applications very soon. THANKS FOR READING………… UMESH DUTTA Posted 24th October 2014 by Umesh Dutta 0 Add a comment Oct 23 Serial Communication in 8051 Microcontroller SERIAL COMMUNICATION IN 8051 Hello readers, today I am writing about serial communication of data in one of the most widely used microcontroller (8051). Lot of applications require microcontrollers to either accept the data in serial form or o/p the data in serial form. Microcontrollers can communicate data in either parallel form or serial form. In parallel communication, data is transferred over more than one wire for example if 8 wires of one microcontroller are connected to any other peripheral device or another microcontroller then at a particular time 8 data bits are transferred. On the other hand in serial communication, data is transferred in bit by bit manner over a single wire. For example if a microcontroller 1 is transferring data to another microcontroller 2 in serial form then TXD pin of microcontroller 1 will be connected to RXD pin of microcontroller 2 and data is transferred from microcontroller 1 to microcontroller 2 in bit by bit manner over a single wire. If microcontroller 2 wants to send some data to microcontroller 1 then for that TXD pin of microcontroller 2 must be connected to RXD pin of microcontroller 1 and again data bits will be transferred over a single wire. So it is clear that for full duplex communication of data two wires are involved and for simplex communication only one wire will be involved. Parallel communication requires more number of wires than serial communication but it has higher speed of data transfer as more than one bit is transferred at a given time. Serial communication is preferred when the distance b/w transmitter and receiver is large and it is required to save the cabling cost and reduce h/w complexity but definitely this comes at the cost of reduced speed of data transfer. Fig. 1 below shows parallel data transmission- Fig.1 Parallel data transmission Fig.2 below shows serial data transmission- Fig.2 serial data transmission In serial communication parallel to serial converter and serial to parallel converter module is required. In 8051 in built UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) module performs the job of serial communication of data. Data communication process can be synchronous or asynchronous. The following points clearly discriminates between these two modes of data transfer- Synchronous data transfer: sender and receiver use the same clock signal supports high data transfer rate needs clock signal between the sender and the receiver requires master/slave configuration Asynchronous data transfer: sender provides a synchronization signal to the receiver before starting the transfer of each message does not need clock signal between the sender and the receiver slower data transfer rate In 8051 microcontroller serial communication of data is performed with the help of following special purpose registers- 1. SBUF (Serial buffer register) 2. SCON (serial control register) 3. TMOD (Timer mode register) 4. TCON (Timer control register) 5. TH1 (Timer1 register higher byte) Before going further it is extremely important to first understand these registers and their importance with reference to serial communication. 1. SBUF (Serial buffer register) It is an 8-bit register and is used for serial communication of data in 8051 microcontroller. Whatever data is required to be transmitted via TXD line must be placed in the SBUF register. Similarly the received data via RXD line is saved in SBUF register. When data is written to SBUF register then it is framed in b/w start and stop bit before it is transmitted via TXD line and similarly during reception of data start and stop bits are removed and actual data bits are extracted from the received frame and then it is placed in the SBUF register. 2. SCON (Serial control register) SM0, SM1 Serial port mode specifier REN (Receive enable) set/cleared by software to enable/disable reception. TI Transmit interrupt flag. RI Receive interrupt flag. SM2 = TB8 = RB8 =0 (not widely used) SM1 and SM0 determine the framing of data. Only mode 1 is compatible with COM port of PC. 3. TMOD (Timer mode register) Both timer 0 and timer 1 use the same register, called TMOD, to set the various timer modes. TMOD is an 8-bit register in which the lower 4-bits are set aside for timer 0 and the upper 4-bits are set aside for timer 1. In each case, the lower 2 bits are used to set the timer mode and the upper two bits are used to specify the operation. C/T- If this bit is set then counter operation is performed (for counting applications) and if this bit is clear then timer operation is performed (for delay generation ). The clock source for timer is the crystal oscillator that is connected to the 8051 micro-controller. Crystal oscillator also determines the speed at which the timer ticks. 4. TCON (Timer Control Register) 5. TH1 (Timer 1 register high byte) Timer 1 high byte register is loaded with appropriate value for baud rate generation. Timer 1 in mode 2 is used for baud rate generation. Concept of Baud Rate Generation in 8051 Micro-controller 8051 divides the crystal oscillator frequency by 12 to get the machine cycle frequency. UART divides the machine cycle frequency by 32 and sends it to Timer 1 to set the baud rate. Timer 1, mode 2 (8-bit, auto-reload) Define TH1 to set the baud rate. XTAL = 11.0592 MHz The system frequency = 11.0592 MHz / 12 = 921.6 kHz Timer 1 has 921.6 kHz/ 32 = 28,800 Hz as source Baud rate = 28,800/3= 9,600 bps So TH1 must be loaded with value of FDH (-3) for the generation of baud rate of 9600 bps. For the crystal oscillator frequency of 11.0592MHz the below given table can be used as a reference for getting the value that is required to be loaded into TH1 register for the desired baud rate generation. Baud Rate TH1 (Decimal) TH1 (Hex) 9600 -3 FD 4800 -6 FA 2400 -12 F4 1200 -24 E8 What is the significance/Importance of TI and RI flags? When 8051 is transmitting serial data then TI flag (Transmit Interrupt Flag) plays a very important role. This flag must be monitored to check whether data transfer operation is executed successfully or not. This bit is set by the hardware at the beginning of the stop bit in mode 1. This flag bit must be cleared by software. In embedded C the instructions that can be used to monitor the status of TI flag is- SBUF = ’U’; // load SBUF with the data that is required to be transmitted While (TI ==0); //stay on this line till TI=0 (wait until transmitted) TI=0; // clear TI flag Similarly during reception RI flag (Receive Interrupt Flag) plays a very important role. This flag must be monitored to check whether any data is received or not. This flag bit is set in half way through the stop bit in mode 1 and must be cleared by the software. The instructions that can be used to monitor the status of RI flag in embedded C are- While (RI==0); // stay on this line till RI=0 (wait to receive) temp = SBUF; //read SBUF and store it in some temp variable P2 = temp; // put the received data on port 2 RI=0; // clear the RI flag In simple terms TI = 1 indicates that data is transferred successfully and RI = 1 indicates that data byte is received successfully. Programming Steps for Serial data transmission- Step 1- Load TMOD register with 0X20 (timer 1 in mode2) In embedded C- TMOD = 0X20; In Assembly Language- MOV TMOD, #20H Step 2- Load TH1 with a value for the required baud rate generation (refer to baud rate table) TH1=0XFD (for 9600bps baud rate). In embedded C- TH1 = 0XFD; In Assemble Language- MOV TH1, #0FDH Step 3- Load SCON with 0X50 (serial mode 1 with REN = 1), receive operation is enabled. In Embedded C- SCON=0X50; In Assembly Language- MOV SCON, #50H Step 4- Set TR1 bit to start timer 1. In Embedded C- TR1=1; In Assembly Language- SETB TR1 Step 5- Clear the transmit interrupt flag before transmitting any data. This is just to make sure that UART is ready to transfer a new byte of data. In Embedded C- TI=0; In Assembly Language- CLR TI Step 6- Load the data to be transmitted in SBUF register In Embedded C- SBUF = ‘U’; // example ‘U’ us loaded in SBUF In Assembly Language- MOV SBUF, #’U’ Step 7- Monitor the TI flag to check whether the data has been transmitted successfully or not. In embedded C- while (TI==0); In Assembly Language- Here: JNB TI, Here Step 8- To transfer the next data byte, go to step 5, and start again. It does not mean that one should repeat all the steps for transmitting 1 byte of data. In embedded C you can create a function for doing steps 5 to 7 and pass data to be transmitted dynamically to the function. In assembly program one can make a subroutine and it can be called any time whenever data is required to be transmitted. Programming Steps for Serial data reception- Step1- Load TMOD register with 0X20 (timer 1 in mode2) In embedded C- TMOD = 0X20; In Assembly Language- MOV TMOD, #20H Step 2-Load TH1 with a value for the required baud rate generation (refer to baud rate table) TH1=0XFD (for 9600bps baud rate). In embedded C- TH1 = 0XFD; In Assemble Language- MOV TH1, #0FDH Step 3- Load SCON with 0X50 (serial mode 1 with REN = 1), receive operation is enabled. In Embedded C- SCON=0X50; In Assembly Language- MOV SCON, #50H Step 4- Set TR1 bit to start timer 1. In Embedded C- TR1=1; In Assembly Language- SETB TR1 Step 5- Clear the receive interrupt flag before receiving any data. This is just to make sure that UART is ready to receive a new byte of data. In Embedded C- RI=0; In Assembly Language- CLR RI Step 6- Monitor the RI flag to check whether the data has been received successfully or not. In embedded C- while (RI==0); In Assembly Language- Here: JNB RI, Here Step 7- When RI becomes 1 it means that a data byte is received and so the received data byte must be stored in some temporary variable for further processing. temp = SBUF; Storing the SBUF value in a temporary variable is one way to save the SBUF value you can use your own way to make sure that the data byte received is moved to the safe place. Step 8- To receive the next data byte, go to step 5. Again note that you can make your program modular with the use of function in embedded C for performing the repetitive job of step 5 to 7. In Assembly language you can make subroutine for performing steps 5 to 7. I hope that these concepts will be useful for the readers to start the programming of real time applications which involve serial data communication using 8051 micro-controller. In the upcoming articles I will share such applications along with proteus simulations for better understanding. THANKS FOR READING......................

Juli (vor 7 Tagen) an mich Lieber Tommy, hier -wie per Whatsapp angekündigt- unser Ruanda Plan als Excel-Dokument. Ein paar Punkte dazu: 1. Wir kommen am Freitag, den 5. August abends an und fahren ins &quot;Five to Five Hotel&quot;. Dort sind wir 3 Nächte. Wir können uns also am Wochenende (6 &amp; 7 August) in Kigali treffen. Klara und ich würden gerne sehen, wo Du lebst und arbeitest und so was alles..... Wir bekommen unseren wagen am Samstag Vormittag. 2. Am Montag fahren wir für 2 Tage zum Kivu-Lake und kommen am Mittwoch, den 10. August zurück. Dann übernachten wir in Kigali für eine Nacht im &quot;Hotel des Mille Colines&quot; aus dem Film &quot;Hotel Ruanda&quot;. 3. Ab DONNERSTAG, den 11. August müsstest Du dann Urlaub nehmen!!! Dann fahren wir morgens nach Musanze (Ruhengeri). Am Freitag, den 12. August machen wir dann unseren Gorilla Treck.... Am Samstag, den 13. August sind wir auch noch im/am Vulcano Nationalpark. Mal sehen, was wir dann machen... (Golden Monkeys, Fossey Grab oder so...) Am Sonntag, den 14. August fahren wir zurück nach Kigali. 4. Was wir dann in der folgenden Woche ( ab 15. August) machen, steht noch nicht fest. Wie Du in dem Excel-Plan siehst, haben wir noch nichts geplant, noch nichts gebucht. Es gibt ja noch weitere Nationalparks und wir wollen noch auf einen der Vulkane steigen. Alles klar??? Die Hotel-Adressen und so stehen im Excel-Sheet. Wie ist das Wetter? Wie viel regnet es? Ab August soll es ja trockener werden... Viele Grüße aus Düsseldorf.

We won't show you that ad again. Why didn't you like it? Uninteresting Misleading Offensive Repetitive Other Oops! I didn't mean to do this. up vote 14 down vote favorite 5 I'm trying to find a way to automatically login to Facebook without browser using Python. I experimented with &quot;requests&quot; lib. Tried several ways: URL = 'http://m.facebook.com' requests.get(URL, auth = ('email@domain.com', 'mypassword')) ... form_data = {'email': 'email@domain.com', 'pass' : 'mypassword' } requests.post(URL, data = form_data) ... requests.post(URL + '?email=email@domain.com&amp;pass=mypassword') The last method fills &quot;email&quot; box on a page but &quot;pass&quot; box remains empty... Could someone help me with this please? Is it possible to emulate FB login using requests? Thanks! python facebook facebook-login python-requests share|improve this question asked Feb 21 '14 at 7:48 alexryabkov 76115 Which library does request come from? urllib2? – Torxed Feb 21 '14 at 7:57 1 @Torxed, Maybe python-requests (Authentication - Requests documentation). – falsetru Feb 21 '14 at 8:31 @falsetru Doh yea figures, thought it was some odd tag of from urllib.request :) – Torxed Feb 21 '14 at 8:33 add a comment | 4 Answers 4 active oldest votes up vote 14 down vote You need to send a complete form. The easiest way to find out what Facebook expects is to use something like Google Chrome's developer tools to monitor your web requests. To make your life easier I've monitored my own login on Facebook, and reproduced it below (with private information redacted, obviously) with the unimportant information stripped: Request URL:https://m.facebook.com/login.php?refsrc=https%3A%2F%2Fm.facebook.com%2F&amp;refid=8 Request Method:POST Form Data: lsd:AVqAE5Wf charset_test:€,´,€,´,水,Д,Є version:1 ajax:0 width:0 pxr:0 gps:0 m_ts:1392974963 li:cxwHUxatQiaLv1nZEYPp0aTB email:... pass:... login:Log In As you can see, the form contains a lot of fields. All of these need to be provided to allow you to log in. Email and password will be provided by your code. The rest of the fields actually have their values set by the HTML that Facebook serves you. This means, to emulate a browser login you need to perform the following steps: Do a GET to the login page (https://m.facebook.com/) Use a HTML parsing library (e.g. BeautifulSoup) to parse the HTML and find the default values of the form fields. The default values are all in &lt;input&gt; HTML elements below the #login_form element. You'll want to find them by name (e.g. charset_test) and then pull out their value attribute. Working out how to do this is outside the scope of this answer, so I'm not going to go into it. Combine the default values of the form fields with your email and password, like so: data = { 'lsd': lsd, 'charset_test': csettest, 'version': version, 'ajax': ajax, 'width': width, 'pxr': pxr, 'gps': gps, 'm_ts': mts, 'li': li, } data['email'] = email data['pass'] = pass data['login'] = 'Log In' Send your login using a Requests Session: s = requests.Session() r = s.post(url, data=data) r.raise_for_status() Send all your future HTTP traffic through that Session. As you can see, this is a non-trivial way of doing things. That's because it's not expected that programs will use the website to log in: instead, you're expected to use their SDK or their web API instead. share|improve this answer answered Feb 21 '14 at 9:43 Lukasa 3,0081019 1 Thank you very much! BTW, I've just found a library called &quot;mechanize&quot;, looks like it can do FB login simpler that with &quot;requests&quot;. – alexryabkov Feb 21 '14 at 10:58 Yeah, mechanize will make this substantially easier. – Lukasa Feb 21 '14 at 13:28 This works for me! Thank you so much! – Charles Chow Sep 20 '15 at 20:48 add a comment | No problem. We won't show you that ad again. Why didn't you like it? Uninteresting Misleading Offensive Repetitive Other Oops! I didn't mean to do this. up vote 6 down vote I was also searching for answer. Doing it with requests is pain. So, i used mechanize. import mechanize browser = mechanize.Browser() browser.set_handle_robots(False) cookies = mechanize.CookieJar() browser.set_cookiejar(cookies) browser.addheaders = [('User-agent', 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.7 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/7.0.517.41 Safari/534.7')] browser.set_handle_refresh(False) url = 'http://www.facebook.com/login.php' self.browser.open(url) self.browser.select_form(nr = 0) #This is login-password form -&gt; nr = number = 0 self.browser.form['email'] = YourLogin self.browser.form['pass'] = YourPassw response = self.browser.submit() print response.read() It works. mechanize.browser is emulated browser, so you don't need to send all form values. It will send them as normal browser, you should provide only login and password. Good luck! share|improve this answer edited Nov 11 '15 at 9:52 Liam 8531522 answered Jun 27 '15 at 17:59 rzaaeeff 147212 2 When I use this code I get a FB error page saying that I don't have cookies enabled. – Sparr Jul 9 '15 at 16:44 1 Did you manage to solve your problem? I'm facing the cookies issue as well, no solution so far. Thanks. – Neria Nachum Apr 20 at 11:22 add a comment | up vote 1 down vote First of all, you need ALL the form data. You can't just send user+pass, the server won't allow it. Secondly you will need to take care and use the cookies recieved from Facebook in order for this to work. But all in all, yes you can use request or any other library. But i would reccomend using their API instead. share|improve this answer answered Feb 21 '14 at 7:58 Torxed 9,13553867 add a comment | up vote 0 down vote I can say it's quite annoying to log in to Facebook without using their API. They also like to change everything so often it is quite the job to maintain the code. I did this a while ago, but I don't think my code is up to speed with current Facebook. However it should be a useful starting-point: https://gitorious.org/blogsmashonfb/blogsmashonfb/source/4f7ee94a56fdffe9392485df8999e340f97f4bbe: It has two parts, a webcrawler and a Facebook-handler (the latter is what you are interested in). One major issue you have in your code is that you must first visit Facebook, because they send you a login form with hidden elements that you need to send back. share|improve this answer edited Feb 21 '14 at 9:44 answered Feb 21 '14 at 9:38 deinonychusaur 2,42611330 add a comment | Your Answer draft saved draft discarded Sign up or log in Sign up using Google Sign up using Facebook Sign up using Email and Password Post as a guest Name Email discard By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service.

                   NS1:content=" Search: Python ConfigParserExamples ConfigParserExamples FrontPage RecentChanges FindPage HelpContents ConfigParserExamples Page Immutable Page Comments Info Attachments User Login Basic configparser usage These are some examples on using ConfigParser, assuming the following INI file... [SectionOne] Status: Single Name: Derek Value: Yes Age: 30 Single: True [SectionTwo] FavoriteColor = Green [SectionThree] FamilyName: Johnson [Others] Route: 66 &gt;&gt;&gt; import ConfigParser &gt;&gt;&gt; Config = ConfigParser.ConfigParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; Config &lt;ConfigParser.ConfigParser instance at 0x00BA9B20&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Config.read(&quot;c:\\tomorrow.ini&quot;) ['c:\\tomorrow.ini'] &gt;&gt;&gt; Config.sections() ['Others', 'SectionThree', 'SectionOne', 'SectionTwo'] &gt;&gt;&gt; Explanation: We first import the configparser, tell it to read the file, and get a listing of the sections. Sections are listed in square brackets []. Next, we are going to get some settings, after defining a helper function. The Function: def ConfigSectionMap(section): dict1 = {} options = Config.options(section) for option in options: try: dict1[option] = Config.get(section, option) if dict1[option] == -1: DebugPrint(&quot;skip: %s&quot; % option) except: print(&quot;exception on %s!&quot; % option) dict1[option] = None return dict1 Now the code: &gt;&gt;&gt; Name = ConfigSectionMap(&quot;SectionOne&quot;)['name'] &gt;&gt;&gt; Age = ConfigSectionMap(&quot;SectionOne&quot;)['age'] &gt;&gt;&gt; print &quot;Hello %s. You are %s years old.&quot; % (Name, Age) Hello Derek. You are 30 years old. This works great most of the time, but what about the &quot;Value: Yes&quot; and &quot;Single: True&quot; values? Those are booleans. They can be either True or False, Yes or No, 1 or 0, on or off. To read a boolean value, you use: Config.getboolean(section, option) Example, continuing from above: &gt;&gt;&gt; single = Config.getboolean(&quot;SectionOne&quot;, &quot;single&quot;) &gt;&gt;&gt; single True You can also use getint(section, option) to get a number as an int. This may be easier to use than int(Config.get(section, option)) There is also getfloat which is used the same as getint, but, as you guessed, returns a float instead of an int. Notes on reading an INI file lines beginning with a semicolon ';' a pound sign '#' or the letters 'REM' (uppercase or lowercase) will be ignored. You may use these for comments if you want. You cannot put a comment on an option line. It will only be treated as a comment if it is at the beginning of the line! Writing an INI file When you write to an INI file, you will wipe out all comments. Assuming the config file doesn't exist yet, this is the code to create one: # lets create that config file for next time... cfgfile = open(&quot;c:\\next.ini&quot;,'w') # add the settings to the structure of the file, and lets write it out... Config.add_section('Person') Config.set('Person','HasEyes',True) Config.set('Person','Age', 50) Config.write(cfgfile) cfgfile.close() Advanced configparser usage ExtendedInterpolation Using ExtendedInterpolation one can make use of cross-chapter flexible parameter values. For instance, using the following ini file: [SectionOne] Param1: Hello Param2: World [SectionTwo] Param1: ${SectionOne:Param1} ${SectionOne:Param2} [SectionThree] Alpha: One Bravo: Two Charlie: ${Alpha} Mississippi By setting _interpolation to ExtendedInterpolation() the values become dynamic. &gt;&gt;&gt; import configparser &gt;&gt;&gt; settings = configparser.ConfigParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; settings._interpolation = configparser.ExtendedInterpolation() &gt;&gt;&gt; settings.read('settings.ini') ['settings.ini'] &gt;&gt;&gt; settings.sections() ['SectionOne', 'SectionTwo', 'SectionThree'] &gt;&gt;&gt; settings.get('SectionTwo', 'Param1') 'Hello World' &gt;&gt;&gt; settings.get('SectionThree', 'Charlie') 'One Mississippi' CategoryDocumentation ConfigParserExamples (last edited 2016-04-11 04:17:05 by bignose) MoinMoin Powered Python Powered GPL licensed Valid HTML 4.01 Unable to edit the page?

Apr 24, 2016 - 11:23 AM Fivestar widget 1 2 3 4 5 Total votes: 0 Type: Complete code Compiler/Assembler: WinAVR (GNU GCC) I've finished these 2 classes to manage I/O pins. I wanted 3 main things with these libs: - Abstraction, so they work with every 8bit AVR mcu. - To manage different active levels for each pin (useful for pullup pins and such). - Faster than arduino libs. A sample blink.cpp program looks like this: int main() { Pin led(Port::B, 5, OUTPUT); while(true) { led.high(); delay(1000); led.low(); delay(1000); } } If you want to invert the output of that pin, pass the active level to the constructor as this (or use the &quot;mode()&quot; function): int main() { Pin led(Port::B, 5, OUTPUT, LOW); while(true) { led.high(); delay(1000); led.low(); delay(1000); } } That way, when issuing a: led.high() the output will be 0 volts accordingly. Another example, reading the state of a button: int main() { Pin led(Port::B, 5, OUTPUT); Pin button(Port::D, 2, INPUT_PULLUP, LOW); while(true) { if (button.active()) { led.toggle(); delay(200); } } } For reading a pin we use the &quot;active()&quot; function. This function also understands different activation levels. In this case we used a internal pull up resistor for the button, so 0 volts means the button is pressed. That's why the button object has LOW in the active level parameter. Other functions are: - Pin::high() -&gt; sets that pin to a HIGH &quot;logical&quot; value. - Pin::low() -&gt; sets that pin to a LOW &quot;logical&quot; value. - Pin::toggle() -&gt; toggle the state of an output pin. - Pin::active() -&gt; returns a boolean indicating if that input pin is HIGH or LOW depending on the activation level. - Pin::mode() -&gt; change the pin mode and activation level. The Port class shouldn't be used directly, but you can. The different Port variables (A, B, C...) are automatically declared if the assosiated PORTX is defined. I've added up to PORTG (atmega256). I think this is the maximum port for any 8bit AVR device. These libs are GPL v2. Hope you find the code useful.

Ansible is a configuration management and provisioning tool, similar to Chef, Puppet or Salt. I've found it to be one of the simplest and the easiest to get started with. A lot of this is because it's &quot;just SSH&quot;; It uses SSH to connect to servers and run the configured Tasks. One nice thing about Ansible is that it's very easy to convert bash scripts (still a popular way to accomplish configuration management) into Ansible Tasks. Since it's primarily SSH based, it's not hard to see why this might be the case - Ansible ends up running the same commands. We could just script our own provisioners, but Ansible is much cleaner because it automates the process of getting context before running Tasks. With this context, Ansible is able to handle most edge cases - the kind we usually take care of with longer and increasingly complex scripts. Ansible Tasks are idempotent. Without a lot of extra coding, bash scripts are usually not safety run again and again. Ansible uses &quot;Facts&quot;, which is system and environment information it gathers (&quot;context&quot;) before running Tasks. Ansible uses these facts to check state and see if it needs to change anything in order to get the desired outcome. This makes it safe to run Ansible Tasks against a server over and over again. Here I'll show how easy it is to get started with Anible. We'll start basic and then add in more features as we improve upon our configurations. Install Of course we need to start by installing Ansible. Tasks can be run off of any machine Ansible is installed on. This means there's usually a &quot;central&quot; server running Ansible commands, although there's nothing particularly special about what server Ansible is installed on. Ansible is &quot;agentless&quot; - there's no central agent(s) running. We can even run Ansible from any server; I often run Tasks from my laptop. Here's how to install Ansible on Ubuntu 14.04. We'll use the easy-to-remember ppa:ansible/ansible repository as per the official docs. sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:ansible/ansible sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install -y ansible Managing Servers Ansible has a default inventory file used to define which servers it will be managing. After installation, there's an example one you can reference at /etc/ansible/hosts. I usually copy and move the default one so I can reference it later: sudo mv /etc/ansible/hosts /etc/ansible/hosts.orig Then I create my own inventory file from scratch. After moving the example inventory file, create a new /etc/ansible/hosts file, and define some servers to manage. Here's we'll define two servers under the &quot;web&quot; label: [web] 192.168.22.10 192.168.22.11 That's good enough for now. If needed, we can define ranges of hosts, multiple groups, reusable variables, and use other fancy setups, including creating a dynamic inventory. For testing this article, I created a virtual machine, installed Ansible, and then ran Ansible Tasks directly on that server. To do this, my hosts inventory file simply looked like this: [local] 127.0.0.1 This makes testing pretty easy - I don't need to setup multiple servers or virtual machines. A consequence of this is that I need to tell Ansible to run Tasks as user &quot;vagrant&quot; and use password-based (rather than key-based) authentication. Basic: Running Commands Once we have an inventory configured, we can start running Tasks against the defined servers. Ansible will assume you have SSH access available to your servers, usually based on SSH-Key. Because Ansible uses SSH, the server it's on needs to be able to SSH into the inventory servers. It will attempt to connect as the current user it is being run as. If I'm running Ansible as user vagrant, it will attempt to connect as user vagrant on the other servers. If Ansible can directly SSH into the managed servers, we can run commands without too much fuss: $ ansible all -m ping 127.0.0.1 | success &gt;&gt; { &quot;changed&quot;: false, &quot;ping&quot;: &quot;pong&quot; } We can see the output we get from Ansible is some JSON which tells us if the Task made any changes and the result. If we need to define the user and perhaps some other settings in order to connect to our server, we can. When testing locally on Vagrant, I use the following: ansible all -m ping -s -k -u vagrant Let's cover these commands: all - Use all defined servers from the inventory file -m ping - Use the &quot;ping&quot; module, which simply runs the ping command and returns the results -s - Use &quot;sudo&quot; to run the commands -k - Ask for a password rather than use key-based authentication -u vagrant - Log into servers using user vagrant Modules Ansible uses &quot;modules&quot; to accomplish most of its Tasks. Modules can do things like install software, copy files, use templates and much more. Modules are the way to use Ansible, as they can use available context (&quot;Facts&quot;) in order to determine what actions, if any need to be done to accomplish a Task. If we didn't have modules, we'd be left running arbitrary shell commands like this: ansible all -s -m shell -a 'apt-get install nginx' Here, the sudo apt-get install nginx command will be run using the &quot;shell&quot; module. The -a flag is used to pass any arguments to the module. I use -s to run this command using sudo. However this isn't particularly powerful. While it's handy to be able to run these commands on all of our servers at once, we still only accomplish what any bash script might do. If we used a more appropriate module instead, we can run commands with an assurance of the result. Ansible modules ensure indempotence - we can run the same Tasks over and over without affecting the final result. For installing software on Debian/Ubuntu servers, the &quot;apt&quot; module will run the same command, but ensure idempotence. ansible all -s -m apt -a 'pkg=nginx state=installed update_cache=true' 127.0.0.1 | success &gt;&gt; { &quot;changed&quot;: false } This will use the apt module to update the repository cache and install Nginx (if not installed). The result of running the Task was &quot;changed&quot;: false. This shows that there were no changes; I had already installed Nginx. I can run this command over and over without worrying about it affecting the desired result. Going over the command: all - Run on all defined hosts from the inventory file -s - Run using sudo -m apt - Use the apt module -a 'pkg=nginx state=installed update_cache=true' - Provide the arguments for the apt module, including the package name, our desired end state and whether to update the package repository cache or not We can run all of our needed Tasks (via modules) in this ad-hoc way, but let's make this more managable. We'll move this Task into a Playbook, which can run and coordinate multiple Tasks. Basic Playbook Playbooks can run multiple Tasks and provide some more advanced functionality that we would miss out on using ad-hoc commands. Let's move the above Task into a playbook. Playbooks and Roles in Ansible all use Yaml. Create file nginx.yml: --- - hosts: local tasks: - name: Install Nginx apt: pkg=nginx state=installed update_cache=true This Task does exactly the same as our ad-hoc command, however I chose to specify my &quot;local&quot; group of servers rather than &quot;all&quot;. We can run it with the ansible-playbook command: $ ansible-playbook -s nginx.yml PLAY [local] ****************************************************************** GATHERING FACTS *************************************************************** ok: [127.0.0.1] TASK: [Install Nginx] ********************************************************* ok: [127.0.0.1] PLAY RECAP ******************************************************************** 127.0.0.1 : ok=2 changed=0 unreachable=0 failed=0 Use use -s to tell Ansible to use sudo again, and then pass the Playbook file. We get some useful feedback while this runs, including the Tasks Ansible runs and their result. Here we see all ran OK, but nothing was changed. I have Nginx installed already. I used the command $ ansible-playbook -s -k -u vagrant nginx.yml to run this playbook locally on my Vagrant installation. Handlers A Handler is exactly the same as a Task (it can do anything a Task can), but it will run when called by another Task. You can think of it as part of an Event system; A Handler will take an action when called by an event it listens for. This is useful for &quot;secondary&quot; actions that might be required after running a Task, such as starting a new service after installation or reloading a service after a configuration change. --- - hosts: local tasks: - name: Install Nginx apt: pkg=nginx state=installed update_cache=true notify: - Start Nginx handlers: - name: Start Nginx service: name=nginx state=started We can add a notify directive to the installation Task. This notifies any Handler named &quot;Start Nginx&quot; after the Task is run. Then we can create the Handler called &quot;Start Nginx&quot;. This Handler is the Task called when &quot;Start Nginx&quot; is notified. This particular Handler uses the Service module, which can start, stop, restart, reload (and so on) system services. Here we simply tell Ansible that we want Nginx to be started. Note that Ansible has us define the state you wish the service to be in, rather than defining the change you want. Ansible will decide if a change is needed, we just tell it the desired result. Let's run this Playbook again: $ ansible-playbook -s nginx.yml PLAY [local] ****************************************************************** GATHERING FACTS *************************************************************** ok: [127.0.0.1] TASK: [Install Nginx] ********************************************************* ok: [127.0.0.1] NOTIFIED: [nginx | Start Nginx] *********************************************** ok: [127.0.0.1] PLAY RECAP ******************************************************************** 127.0.0.1 : ok=2 changed=0 unreachable=0 failed=0 We get the similar output, but this time the Handler was run. Notifiers are only run if the Task is run. If I already had Nginx installed, the Install Nginx Task would not be run and the notifier would not be called. We can use Playbooks to run multiple Tasks, add in variables, define other settings and even include other playbooks. More Tasks Next we can add a few more Tasks to this Playbook and explore some other functionality. --- - hosts: local vars: - docroot: /var/www/serversforhackers.com/public tasks: - name: Add Nginx Repository apt_repository: repo='ppa:nginx/stable' state=present register: ppastable - name: Install Nginx apt: pkg=nginx state=installed update_cache=true when: ppastable|success register: nginxinstalled notify: - Start Nginx - name: Create Web Root when: nginxinstalled|success file: dest={{ '{{' }} docroot {{ '}}' }} mode=775 state=directory owner=www-data group=www-data notify: - Reload Nginx handlers: - name: Start Nginx service: name=nginx state=started - name: Reload Nginx service: name=nginx state=reloaded There are now three Tasks: Add Nginx Repository - Add the Nginx stable PPA to get the latest stable version of Nginx, using the apt_repository module. Install Nginx - Installs Nginx using the Apt module. Create Web Root - Finally, create a web root directory. Also new here are the register and when directives. These tell Ansible to run a Task when something else happens. The &quot;Add Nginx Repository&quot; Task registers &quot;ppastable&quot;. Then we use that to inform the Install Nginx Task to only run when the registered &quot;ppastable&quot; Task is successful. This allows us to conditionally stop Ansible from running a Task. We also use a variable. The docroot variable is defined in the var section. It's then used as the destination argument of the file module which creates the defined directory. This playbook can be run with the usual command: ansible-playbook -s nginx.yml # Or, as I ran on my Vagrant machine: ansible-playbook -s -k -u vagrant nginx.yml Next we'll take Ansible further and by organizing the Playbook into a Role while also showing some more functionality. Roles Roles are good for organizing multiple, related Tasks and encapsulating data needed to accomplish those Tasks. For example, installing Nginx may involve adding a package repository, installing the package and setting up configuration. We've seen installation in action in a Playbook, but once we start configuring our installations, the Playbooks tend to get a little more busy. The configuration portion often requires extra data such as variables, files, dynamic templates and more. These tools can be used with Playbooks, but we can do better immediately by organizing related Tasks and data into one coherent structure: a Role. Roles have a directory structure like this: rolename - files - handlers - meta - templates - tasks - vars Within each directory, Ansible will search for and read any Yaml file called main.yml automatically. We'll break apart our nginx.yml file and put each component within the corresponding directory to create a cleaner and more complete provisioning toolset. Files First, within the files directory, we can add files that we'll want copied into our servers. For Nginx, I often copy H5BP's Nginx component configurations. I simply download the latest from Github, make any tweaks I want, and put them into the files directory. nginx - files - - h5bp As we'll see, these configurations will be added via the copy module. Handlers Inside of the handlers directory, we can put all of our Handlers that were once within the nginx.yml Playbook. Inside of handlers/main.yml: --- - name: Start Nginx service: name=nginx state=started - name: Reload Nginx service: name=nginx state=reloaded Once these are in place, we can reference them from other files freely. Meta The main.yml file within the meta directory contains Role meta data, including dependencies. If this Role depended on another Role, we could define that here. For example, I have the Nginx Role depend on the SSL Role, which installs SSL certificates. --- dependencies: - { role: ssl } If I called the &quot;nginx&quot; Role, it would attempt to first run the &quot;ssl&quot; Role. Otherwise we can omit this file, or define the Role as having no dependencies: --- dependencies: [] Template Template files can contain template variables, based on Python's Jinja2 template engine. Files in here should end in .j2, but can otherwise have any name. Similar to files, we won't find a main.yml file within the templates directory. Here's an example Nginx virtual host configuration. Note that it uses some variables which we'll define later in the vars/main.yml file. Nginx virtual host file found at templates/serversforhackers.com.conf: server { # Enforce the use of HTTPS listen 80 default_server; server_name *.{{ '{{' }} domain {{ '}}' }}; return 301 https://{{ '{{' }} domain {{ '}}' }}$request_uri; } server { listen 443 default_server ssl; root /var/www/{{ '{{' }} domain {{ '}}' }}/public; index index.html index.htm index.php; access_log /var/log/nginx/{{ '{{' }} domain {{ '}}' }}.log; error_log /var/log/nginx/{{ '{{' }} domain {{ '}}' }}-error.log error; server_name {{ '{{' }} domain {{ '}}' }}; charset utf-8; include h5bp/basic.conf; ssl_certificate {{ '{{' }} ssl_crt {{ '}}' }}; ssl_certificate_key {{ '{{' }} ssl_key {{ '}}' }}; include h5bp/directive-only/ssl.conf; location /book { return 301 http://book.{{ '{{' }} domain {{ '}}' }}; } location / { try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args; } location = /favicon.ico { log_not_found off; access_log off; } location = /robots.txt { log_not_found off; access_log off; } location ~ \.php$ { fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$; fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock; fastcgi_index index.php; include fastcgi_params; # fastcgi.conf for version 1.6.1+ fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name; fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info; fastcgi_param ENV production; } # Nginx status # Nginx Plus only #location /status { # status; # status_format json; # allow 127.0.0.1; # deny all; #} location ~ ^/(fpmstatus|fpmping)$ { access_log off; allow 127.0.0.1; deny all; include fastcgi_params; # fastcgi.conf for version 1.6.1+ fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock; } } This is a fairly standard Nginx configuration for a PHP application. There are three variables used here: domain ssl_crt ssl_key These three will be defined in the variables section. Variables Before we look at the Tasks, let's look at variables. The vars directory contains a main.yml file which simply lists variables we'll use. This provides a convenient place for us to change configuration-wide settings. Here's what the vars/main.yml file might look like: --- domain: serversforhackers.com ssl_key: /etc/ssl/sfh/sfh.key ssl_crt: /etc/ssl/sfh/sfh.crt These are three variables which we can use elsewhere in this Role. We saw them used in the template above, but we'll see them in our defined Tasks as well. Tasks Let's finally see this all put together into a series of Tasks. Inside of tasks/main.yml: --- - name: Add Nginx Repository apt_repository: repo='ppa:nginx/stable' state=present register: ppastable - name: Install Nginx apt: pkg=nginx state=installed update_cache=true when: ppastable|success register: nginxinstalled notify: - Start Nginx - name: Add H5BP Config when: nginxinstalled|success copy: src=h5bp dest=/etc/nginx owner=root group=root - name: Disable Default Site when: nginxinstalled|success file: dest=/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default state=absent - name: Add SFH Site Config when: nginxinstalled|success register: sfhconfig template: src=serversforhackers.com.j2 dest=/etc/nginx/sites-available/{{ '{{' }} domain {{ '}}' }}.conf owner=root group=root - name: Enable SFH Site Config when: sfhconfig|success file: src=/etc/nginx/sites-available/{{ '{{' }} domain {{ '}}' }}.conf dest=/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/{{ '{{' }} domain {{ '}}' }}.conf state=link - name: Create Web root when: nginxinstalled|success file: dest=/var/www/{{ '{{' }} domain {{ '}}' }}/public mode=775 state=directory owner=www-data group=www-data notify: - Reload Nginx - name: Web Root Permissions when: nginxinstalled|success file: dest=/var/www/{{ '{{' }} domain {{ '}}' }} mode=775 state=directory owner=www-data group=www-data recurse=yes notify: - Reload Nginx This is a longer series of Tasks, which makes for a more complete installation of Nginx. The Tasks, in order of appearance, accomplish the following: Add the nginx/stable repository Install &amp; start Nginx, register successful installation to trigger remaining Tasks Add H5BP configuration Disable the default virtual host by removing the symlink to the default file from the sites-enabled directory Copy the serversforhackers.com.conf.j2 virtual host template into the Nginx configuration Enable the virtual host configuration by symlinking it to the sites-enabled directory Create the web root Change permission for the project root directory, which is one level above the web root created previously There's some new modules (and new uses of some we've covered), including copy, template, &amp; file. By setting the arguments for each module, we can do some interesting things such as ensuring files are &quot;absent&quot; (delete them if they exist) via state=absent, or create a file as a symlink via state=link. You should check the docs for each module to see what interesting and useful things you can accomplish with them. Running the Role Before running the Role, we need to tell Ansible where our Roles are located. In my Vagrant server, they are located within /vagrant/ansible/roles. We can add this file path to the /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg file: roles_path = /vagrant/ansible/roles Assuming our nginx Role is located at /vagrant/ansible/roles/nginx, we'll be all set to run this Role! Remove the ssl dependency from meta/main.yml before running this Role if you are following along. Let's create a &quot;master&quot; yaml file which defines the Roles to use and what hosts to run them on: File server.yml: --- - hosts: all roles: - nginx In my Vagrant example, I use the host &quot;local&quot; rather than &quot;all&quot;. Then we can run the Role(s): ansible-playbook -s server.yml # Or as I do with my Vagrant VM: ansible-playbook -s -k -u vagrant server.yml Here's the output from the run of the Nginx Role: PLAY [all] ******************************************************************** GATHERING FACTS *************************************************************** ok: [127.0.0.1] TASK: [nginx | Add Nginx Repository] ****************************************** changed: [127.0.0.1] TASK: [nginx | Install Nginx] ************************************************* changed: [127.0.0.1] TASK: [nginx | Add H5BP Config] *********************************************** changed: [127.0.0.1] TASK: [nginx | Disable Default Site] ****************************************** changed: [127.0.0.1] TASK: [nginx | Add SFH Site Config] ******************************************* changed: [127.0.0.1] TASK: [nginx | Enable SFH Site Config] **************************************** changed: [127.0.0.1] TASK: [nginx | Create Web root] *********************************************** changed: [127.0.0.1] TASK: [nginx | Web Root Permissions] ****************************************** ok: [127.0.0.1] NOTIFIED: [nginx | Start Nginx] *********************************************** ok: [127.0.0.1] NOTIFIED: [nginx | Reload Nginx] ********************************************** changed: [127.0.0.1] PLAY RECAP ******************************************************************** 127.0.0.1 : ok=8 changed=7 unreachable=0 failed=0 Awesome, we put all the various components together into a coherent Role and now have Nginx installed and configured! Facts Before running any Tasks, Ansible will gather information about the system it's provisioning. These are called Facts, and include a wide array of system information such as the number of CPU cores, available ipv4 and ipv6 networks, mounted disks, Linux distribution and more. Facts are often useful in Tasks or Tempalte configurations. For example Nginx is commonly set to use as any worker processors as there are CPU cores. Knowing this, you may choose to set your template of the nginx.conf file like so: user www-data www-data; worker_processes {% verbatim %}{{ ansible_processor_cores }}{% endverbatim %}; pid /var/run/nginx.pid; # And other configurations... Or if you have a server with multiple CPU's, you can use: user www-data www-data; worker_processes {% verbatim %}{{ ansible_processor_cores * ansible_processor_count }}{% endverbatim %}; pid /var/run/nginx.pid; # And other configurations... Ansible facts all start with anisble_ and are globally available for use any place variables can be used: Variable files, Tasks, and Templates. Example: NodeJS For Ubuntu, we can get the latest stable NodeJS and NPM from NodeSource, which has teamed up with Chris Lea. Chris ran the Ubuntu repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js, but now provides NodeJS via NodeSource packages. To that end, they have provided a shells script which installs the latest stable NodeJS and NPM on Debian/Ubuntu systems. This shellscript is found at https://deb.nodesource.com/setup. We can take a look at this and convert it to the following tasks from a NodeJS Role: --- - name: Ensure Ubuntu Distro is Supported get_url: url='https://deb.nodesource.com/node/dists/{% verbatim %}{{ ansible_distribution_release }}{% endverbatim %}/Release' dest=/dev/null register: distrosupported - name: Remove Old Chris Lea PPA apt_repository: repo='ppa:chris-lea/node.js' state=absent when: distrosupported|success - name: Remove Old Chris Lea Sources file: path='/etc/apt/sources.list.d/chris-lea-node_js-{% verbatim %}{{ ansible_distribution_release }}{% endverbatim %}.list' state=absent when: distrosupported|success - name: Add Nodesource Keys apt_key: url=https://deb.nodesource.com/gpgkey/nodesource.gpg.key state=present - name: Add Nodesource Apt Sources List Deb apt_repository: repo='deb https://deb.nodesource.com/node {% verbatim %}{{ ansible_distribution_release }}{% endverbatim %} main' state=present when: distrosupported|success - name: Add Nodesource Apt Sources List Deb Src apt_repository: repo='deb-src https://deb.nodesource.com/node {% verbatim %}{{ ansible_distribution_release }}{% endverbatim %} main' state=present when: distrosupported|success - name: Install NodeJS apt: pkg=nodejs state=latest update_cache=true when: distrosupported|success There's a few tricks happening there. These mirror the bash script provided by Node Source. First we create the Ensure Ubuntu Distro is Supported task, which uses the ansible_distribution_release Fact. This gives us the Ubuntu release, such as Precise or Trusty. If the resulting URL exists, then we know our Ubuntu distribution is supported and can continue. We register distrosupported so we can test if this step was successfully on subsequent tasks. Then we run a series of tasks to remove NodeJS repositories in case the system already has ppa:chris-lea/node.js added. These only run when if the distribution is supported via when: distrosupported|success. Note that most of these continue to use the ansible_distribution_release Fact. Finally we get the debian source packages and install NodeJS after updating the repository cache. This will install the latest stable of NodeJS and NPM. We know it will get the latest version available by using state=latest when installing the nodejs package. Vault We often need to store sensitive data in our Ansible templates, Files or Variable files; It unfortunately cannot always be avoided. Ansible has a solution for this called Ansible Vault. Vault allows you to encrypt any Yaml file, which typically boil down to our Variable files. Vault will not encrypt Files and Templates. When creating an encrypted file, you'll be asked a password which you must use to edit the file later and when calling the Roles or Playbooks. For example we can create a new Variable file: ansible-vault create vars/main.yml Vault Password: After entering in the encryption password, the file will be opened in your default editor, usually Vim. The editor used is defined by the EDITOR environmental variable. The default is usually Vim. If you are not a Vim user, you can change it quickly by setting the environmental variabls: export EDITOR=nano ansible-vault edit vars/main.yml T&gt; The editor can be set in the users profile/bash configuration, usually found at ~/.profile, ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc or similar, depending on the shell and Linux distribution used. Ansible Vault itself is fairly self-explanatory. Here are the commands you can use: $ ansible-vault -h Usage: ansible-vault [create|decrypt|edit|encrypt|rekey] \ [--help] [options] file_name Options: -h, --help show this help message and exit For the most part, we'll use ansible-vault create|edit /path/to/file.yml. Here, however, are all of the available commands: create - Create a new file and encrypt it decrypt - Create a plaintext file from an encrypted file edit - Edit an already-existing encrypted file encrypt - Encrypt an existing plain-text file rekey - Set a new password on a encrypted file Example: Users I use Vault when creating new users. In a User Role, you can set a Variable file with users' passwords and a public key to add to the users' authorized_keys file (thus giving you SSH access). T&gt; Public SSH keys are technically safe for the general public to see - all someone can do with them is allow you access to their own servers. Public keys are intentionally useless for gaining access to a sytem without the paired private key, which we are not putting into this Role. Here's an example variable file which can be created and encrypt with Vault. While editing it, it's of course in plain-text: admin_password: $6$lpQ1DqjZQ25gq9YW$mHZAmGhFpPVVv0JCYUFaDovu8u5EqvQi.Ih deploy_password: $6$edOqVumZrYW9$d5zj1Ok/G80DrnckixhkQDpXl0fACDfNx2EHnC common_public_key: ssh-rsa ALongSSHPublicKeyHere Note that the passwords for the users are also hashed. You can read Ansible's documentation on generating encrypted passwords, which the User module requires to set a user password. As a quick primer, it looks like this: # The whois package makes the mkpasswd # command available on Ubuntu $ sudo apt-get install -y whois # Create a password hash $ mkpasswd --method=SHA-512 Password: This will generate a hashed password for you to use with the user module. Once you have set the user passwords and added the public key into the Variables file, we can make a Task to use these encrypted variables: --- - name: Create Admin User user: name=admin password={% verbatim %}{{ admin_password }}{% endverbatim %} groups=sudo append=yes shell=/bin/bash - name: Add Admin Authorized Key authorized_key: user=admin key=&quot;{% verbatim %}{{ common_public_key }}{% endverbatim %}&quot; state=present - name: Create Deploy User user: name=deploy password={% verbatim %}{{ deploy_password }}{% endverbatim %} groups=www-data append=yes shell=/bin/bash - name: Add Deployer Authorized Key authorized_key: user=deploy key=&quot;{% verbatim %}{{ common_public_key }}{% endverbatim %}&quot; state=present These Tasks use the user module to create new users, passing in the passwords set in the Variable file. It also uses the authorized_key module to add the SSH pulic key as an authorized SSH key in the server for each user. Variables are used like usual within the Tasks file. However, in order to run this Role, we'll need to tell Ansible to ask for the Vault password so it can unencrypt the variables. Let's setup a provision.yml Playbook file to call our user Role: --- - hosts: all sudo: yes roles: - user To run this Playbook, we need to tell Ansible to ask for the Vault password, as we're running a Role which contains an encrypted file: ansible-playbook --ask-vault-pass provision.yml Recap Here's what we did: Installed Ansible Configured Ansible inventory Ran idempotent ad-hoc commands on multiple servers simultaneously Created a basic Playbook to run multiple Tasks, using Handlers Abstracted the Tasks into a Role to keep everything Nginx-related organized Saw how to set dependencies Saw how to register Task &quot;dependencies&quot; and run other Tasks only if they are successful Saw how to use more templates, files and variables in our Tasks Saw how to incorporate Ansible Facts Saw how to use Ansible Vault to add security to our variables We covered a lot of ground, and it will get you pretty far. However, there are many more tools provided by Ansible to explore! If this edition piqued your interest, the Servers for Hackers eBook will go into more depth with Ansible and many other topics! Additional Resources Many more example Roles in the Servers for Hackers Github repo. Use Ansible Vault to encrypt secure data, making it more safe if your playbooks or Roles end up in version control or are otherwise shared See the Module Index for more information on available modules There are a lot of useful things you can do with Ansible.

I'd looked at ansible several times before but hadn't the time or inclination before to dig into it to understand and this tutorial was very useful. see more 5 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook − + Avatar Massimiliano Adamo • a month ago thanks man! see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook − + Avatar Raz M • 5 months ago Hi, I'm trying to make the tasks that create users work (Vaults), but Ansible complains about the following: The offending line appears to be: name: admin password: {%verbatim%}{{ admin_password }}{%endverbatim%} ^ here We could be wrong, but this one looks like it might be an issue with missing quotes. Always quote template expression brackets when they start a value. For instance: with_items: - {{ foo }} Should be written as: with_items: - &quot;{{ foo }}&quot; I couldn't find much info about that. I tried various combination, but if I add the double quotes, Ansible complains about unknown variable (%verbatim%) see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook − + Avatar Raz M Raz M • 5 months ago Solved my issue. 1- Moved my &quot;secret.yml&quot; to roles/user/vars/main.yml 2- Removed the &quot;{%verbatim%}&quot; and &quot;{%end_verbatim%}&quot; &lt;- I haven't found documentation about what these verbs are for 3- Added double quotes to all variables (&quot;{{ admin_password }}&quot;) Works like a charm! see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook − + Avatar Raz M • 5 months ago Outstanding!

The likely issue is running that command exactly as you see it is that we aren't telling it to use &quot;sudo&quot;, which is needed for running an apt-get command. You can use -s flag to have it use sudo, and -K to have it ask you the sudo password, if a password is required. But I'd suggest just moving on and using the &quot;apt&quot; module. see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook − + Avatar chollie fideloper • a year ago ansible mygroup -s -K -B 3600 -m apt -a &quot;upgrade=dist&quot; I'm no expert but if password is requied you still need to send in -K when running it as an adhoc command see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook − + Avatar Itamar Gal • a year ago Thanks for the great tutorial!

What is the best way to duplicate the BBB? My understanding of options: SD-Card: Programming each board by inserting a prepared SD card containing an image and pressing the &quot;boot&quot; switch while powering up. How should I prepare that .img file or the SD card from my master BBB? The image should copy to the on-board eMMC, so that the SD-card can be removed afterwards. USB: Programming by connecting the board over USB to a (Win7) PC. Is it possible to write the full on-board eMMC from the PC? With which app to do the writing? How to prepare the image which will be written, starting from the master BBB? Ethernet: Programming over LAN after boot-up with default angstrom distro. Is it even possible over LAN? How to do the writing? How to prepare the image which will be written, starting from the master BBB? Which is possible/best? Edit: My current solution is to flash with a standard image (from the BeagleBoe website) and then have a script do all modifications as expected. This includes disabling many services I don't need, installing applications and configuring stuff etc. If there is an easier way for making a SD card with a full image on it, I'm still interested. linux embedded-linux boot beagleboard beagleboneblack share|improve this question edited Oct 22 '14 at 10:20 asked Jul 24 '13 at 12:51 Philipp 1,37942138 1 check these scripts: github.com/RobertCNelson/tools/tree/master/scripts – Ottavio Campana Jul 24 '13 at 14:16 1 New user @Master tried found this and found it worked on Angstrom Rev 6, but on Rev C Debian board, &quot;it simply doesn't start when booting while holding the S2 Button pressed, all of the LEDs remain turned off and nothing else happen until I Restart the BBB normally.&quot; Anyone have any thoughts? – Chris Stratton Jul 30 '14 at 19:15 @ChrisStratton I'm having the same problems. It backs up a copy of the eMMC to the SD card, but I can't get S2 to work when I go to boot…have you had any luck? – Robert C Edwards Aug 6 '14 at 15:26 1 @RobertCEdwards - I was merely relaying a comment from someone else who had improperly posted it as an answer. I have not personally experimented with one of these particular boards. – Chris Stratton Aug 6 '14 at 15:28 add a comment | 5 Answers 5 active oldest votes up vote 9 down vote accepted For anyone else that needs this, the best answer I've found to this is to do the following: First setup your master Beaglebone Black the way you want it. Backup the eMMC FAT format a 4GB or larger SD card (must be a MBR/bootable formatted microSD card) Download beagleboneblack-save-emmc.zip and extract the contents onto your SD card Note: this is an image from Jason Krinder at his github https://github.com/jadonk/buildroot using the save-emmc-0.0.1 tag Put the card into your powered off Beaglebone Black Power on your Beaglebone Black while holding the S2 Button The USR0 led will blink for about 10 minutes, when it's steady on you have an SD card with a copy of your eMMC in a .img file Use the eMMC to flash a new Beaglebone Black On the SD card edit autorun.sh #!/bin/sh echo timer &gt; /sys/class/leds/beaglebone\:green\:usr0/trigger dd if=/mnt/&lt;image-file&gt;.img of=/dev/mmcblk1 bs=10M sync echo default-on &gt; /sys/class/leds/beaglebone\:green\:usr0/trigger where &lt;image-file&gt; is the image file you got after copying backing up your eMMC Insert the card into your powered off Beaglebone Black Power on your Beaglebone Black while holding the S2 Button The Beaglebone Black should go into rebuilding mode and within about 20 minutes you'll have a newly flashed Beaglebone Black (when all 4 USR LEDs are solid) with a copy of your original eLinux reference used for this article - http://elinux.org/BeagleBone_Black_Extracting_eMMC_contents share|improve this answer edited Mar 13 '15 at 19:50 Visser 412310 answered May 10 '14 at 15:41 Paul Ryan 1,099721 1 Thanks for the edit. This is correct that the S2 button needs to be held until the USR lights start flashing (about 3-10 seconds). – Paul Ryan Jul 4 '14 at 23:22 I was running into problems getting the BBB to boot from the SD card. Turns out you need to mark the SD partition as active in order to boot from it. See Talk section from eLinux article referenced above. – Robert C Edwards Aug 6 '14 at 16:17 I would also recommend, to disconnect everything connected to the board (e.g. USB adapters, eth cable etc.) before powering it on. I was getting just two leds blinking briefly and the nothing before removing every connected device. – Luca Lenardi Feb 18 '15 at 20:35 I'm trying the above instructions and can't get it to work. I have a BBB Rev B. I have a 8GB SD card formatted FAT32. I don't see how you can format it just FAT as I think that only supports 2GB partitions. In either case neither windows 7 nor OSX will allow me to format it non-32 FAT. I disconnect all cables, put the card in, hold down S2 and plug the power in. After about 10 seconds the USR0 LED comes on solid (no flashing), USR2 just barley flashes. I leave it for hours and come back and USR0 is still on solid. I take card out, BBB-eMMC-2967.img is only 10 bytes. What is wrong? – Timothy Vann Feb 26 '15 at 5:20 Anyone know why this wouldn't work on the older 2G version of BBB? I have it working fine with the newer 4G version, but when I try to run it on a 2G one, it goes to a solid LCD immediately, and I only get a 1K image file. I wrote the contents of ls /dev/ to the card and noticed that there mmcblk1 is not there, only mmcblk0 (the SD card). Why would the eMMC not mount on the 2G version when it works fine on the 4G version? – Shawn Jacobson May 19 '15 at 14:29 | show 6 more comments No problem. We won't show you that ad again.

I didn't mean to do this. up vote 6 down vote I have the same need and am using dd and nc (NetCat) to save directly on my desktop without having to use an intermediary SD Card. You can do this over the USB connection, or ethernet connection, by changing the IP address in the steps below. After setting up your BBB with the applications you want, the basic steps are: On the desktop, run this command in a terminal: nc -l 19000|bzip2 -d|dd bs=16M of=BBB.img On the BeagleBone Black, run this command in a terminal (you can SSH into it, or do it directly from the BBB): dd bs=16M if=/dev/mmcblk0|bzip2 -c|nc 192.168.7.1 19000 The 192.168.7.1 address is for the USB connection. (BBB is 192.168.7.2) If you're doing this over an ethernet connection, you should use your desktop's IP address. This is taken from instructions here. Finally, follow any method to install onto the next BBB. Here's an example of how to flash the emmc. share|improve this answer answered Sep 5 '14 at 12:36 SevakPrime 38338 this almost worked, I spent a while before realizing that you need to actually do nc -l -p 19000 or that won't work on Linux Debian – joël Nov 12 '14 at 19:34 SevakPrime, I did manage to get my image BBB.img, and copied it on microSD, inserted in BBB, hold S2 while power it up but I am still not able to flash it back to my eMMC. I may be missing something in your workflow – joël Nov 13 '14 at 1:47 @joelmaranhao, copying it as a file to the microSD card won't work. You need to write it as an image to the microSD card. (See step #5 in the second link above.) See this link for how to write an image: embeddedarm.com/support/faqs.php?item=10 – SevakPrime Nov 13 '14 at 20:08 I didn't formulate my sentence correctly, that is actually exactly what I have done. I used the dd command to write the image, I didn't copy the file img onto the microSD. May be it's an issue with the revision of my BBB – joël Nov 16 '14 at 5:36 1 Is it safe to use dd to capture an image of an active system that is writing back to the device constantly? – kevinc Nov 17 '14 at 16:50 | show 1 more comment up vote 1 down vote As noted at the bottom of the eLinux article, there is a much easier way if you are running the Debian distribution: Boot master BBB with no SD card in Insert SD card Log in (e.g. with serial terminal, SSH etc.) and run sudo /opt/scripts/tools/eMMC/beaglebone-black-make-microSD-flasher-from-eMMC.sh. LEDs will flash in sequence whilst SD card is being written. When the LEDs stop and the script terminates, remove the SD card. Insert SD card into new BBB then power on. eMMC will be flashed; LEDs on new BBB will flash in sequence until complete. share|improve this answer answered Mar 22 at 12:02 emorris 345 add a comment | up vote 0 down vote Copying your emmc Image back to a SD card is a bit tricky, since it will need to be formated in a certain way to get it to mount. Here are some tips to get that working: http://dev.gentoo.org/~armin76/arm/beagleboneblack/install_emmc.xml#expand What might be easier is using an USB thumb drive, or USB SD card reader. Note, currently there are some issues hot-plugging USB devices, so boot with it plugged in. You can copy your entire FS to the USB drive, then compress it. Create a new bootable linux sd image, and put your compressed FS on there and use one of the scripts Ottavio linked to to copy over the compressed image. you can make a systemd service to launch the script on startup. share|improve this answer answered Aug 21 '13 at 7:29 stbtrax 504 add a comment | up vote 0 down vote We have noticed that on Beaglebones with the Jan 23rd 2015 release of Debian, the only way to successfully copy the image from SD is not to hold the boot button down when powering up. share|improve this answer answered Feb 1 at 16:17 Julian Gold 553322 add a comment | protected by Community♦ Aug 28 '14 at 9:31 Thank you for your interest in this question.

However, sometimes you want to create your own custom image. And, if you find yourself doing that more than sometimes - like myself - you will want a repeatable process for generating the custom images. For that I recommend using Robert C. Nelson's OMAP Image Builder, available on GitHub. Using the config files already in the project as a reference, you can easily generate your own custom BBB OS image. In this post I'll provide you with an overview of the OMAP Image Builder project so you know what's what, and walk you through making your own custom OS image for the BBB. Requirements and recommendations Hardware It is highly recommended you use actual ARM7 hardware for building images. If you don't have access to something beefier than a BBB, and you don't want to buy a another (more expensive) board, check out Scaleway. They provide bare-metal ARM computers via a service similar to Linode or DigitalOcean. If you want a non-cloud option, the Wandboard Quad with an attached SATA drive is probably your best value. Software I've used Ubuntu or Debian as the host OS when creating all of my images. You can probably get a Redhat-based distro to work, but I can't vouch for it. I doubt you can use OSX, but I'd love to be proven wrong. Skills This post is targeted towards those who are generally familiar with Linux, and are comfortable with Bash scripting. You'll probably be asked to install a number of missing packages and dependencies, so you should be familiar with how to install software through a CLI package manager. Also if you aren't familiar with chroot, Google it, as it is an essential concept in the image-creation process. OMAP Image Builder overview Building an image with the OMAP Image Builder is essentially a two-step process. Generate an OS filesystem in a chroot jail with custom attributes defined in a config file: ./RootStock-NG.sh -c your_config_file Turn that filesystem into an image that can be copied to a microSD card: ./setup_sdcard.sh [a] [bunch] [of] [options] You can see some examples in the project README. Structure If you haven't done so yet, open the OMAP Image Builder GitHub project in a new tab. We'll be referring back to it. Here is the project structure: omap-image-builder/ ├── configs ├── docs ├── LICENSE ├── machinekit ├── publish ├── readme.md ├── RootStock-NG.sh ├── scripts │ ├── chroot.sh │ ├── debootstrap.sh │ └── install_dependencies.sh ├── target │ ├── boot │ ├── chroot │ ├── init_scripts │ ├── keyring │ └── other └── tools ├── hwpack └── setup_sdcard.sh I've omitted all the files except the few we're interested in. So what's important? RootStock-NG.sh - This is main script for building root filesystem. Input is a config. configs/ - This folder contains the config files that can be used with RootStock-NG.sh target/ - This folder contains scripts, referenced in the config files, that can be optionally accessed while building the filesystem or by setup_sdcard.sh. target/chroot/ - This folder contains scripts that can be executed from within the generated filesystem without knowledge of the host. target/boot - Various boot configs. setup_sdcard.sh - Script that generates the image file from what RootStock-NG.sh makes. Configs and chroot scripts These configs are the input for RootStock-NG.sh. They may also refer to other scripts which will be executed at some point during the build process. In the configs folder you will find a template config file, but without guiding documentation, making it difficult to tell what each variable's purpose is, or what format its value should take. Rather than using that template to make a new config, it is often easier to take a preexisting config file, copy it, and edit it. Let's take a closer look at bb.org-debian-wheezy-console.conf. There are a lot of variables, though there are only a few that you will probably want to change. deb_include - These are the packages that are installed by debootstrap, an application that installs a complete Debian base system in a subdirectory. deb_exclude - These are the packages that would be installed...but you don't want. deb_additional_pkg - Packages listed here are not installed natively by debootstrap, and will likely fail if done in QEMU on non-ARM7 hardware. Remember that warning about building on ARM7? This partly why. It's best to try to install packages via deb_include. rfs_username, rfs_fullname, and rfs_password - I think 'rfs' stands for &quot;root filesystem&quot;. This is where you define the default username and password. chroot_script - The script in target/chroot/ that you want to execute from inside the chroot while building an image. This where you can install python packages, clone git repos, setup configs, etc. all from inside the chroot. Open up the chroot script, beagleboard.org-console.sh that is bb.org-debian-wheezy-console.conf. This a bit confusing, but this is what you use to install system packages. I recommend looking at the other scripts in this folder to see what they do. chroot_after_hook - This isn't currently used by any of the configs in the configs/ folder, but it's essentially like chroot_script; however, the script resides in the project root, and is executed outside of the chroot. This is useful if you have something on the host computer that you need to add to the chroot. Look at the chroot.sh and see where chrootafterhook is called. setup_sdcard.sh setupsdcard.sh is not particularly well documented, but luckily there are a couple good examples of how to use it in beaglboard.orgimage.sh. I personally haven't strayed from these, but if you read the script, you will see that there are a lot more options available. I haven't verified this with the author, but I assume this is the script that is used to generate the official BeagleBone Black images. In the script you can see this function: generic_img () { cd \${base_rootfs}/ sudo ./setup_sdcard.sh \${options} mv *.img ../ cd .. } and a little further down you can see it being used to make the bb.org-debian-wheezy-console image: options=&quot;--img-2gb BBB-eMMC-flasher-\${base_rootfs} --dtb beaglebone --boot_label BEAGLEBONE --enable-systemd --bbb-flasher --bbb-old-bootloader-in-emmc --hostname beaglebone&quot; generic_img Let's look at some of the options used. img-2gb - This is basically defining how big the image will be. Important for BeagleBone Black owners as the latest generation (rev C) has a 4GB eMMC, while past generations had a 2GB eMMC. dtb - I think this is where you say which hardware profile to use from tools/hwpack. bbb-flasher - make it an eMMC flasher (flash the eMMC with the image), as opposed to booting off the SD card. All together now Ok let's make a custom image! This is what we're going to do: Clone the repo Make a custom config file Make a custom chroot script Generate our root filesystem Make an eMMC flasher image out of the root filesystem Compress the image so you can easily send it to all your friends Step 1: Clone that repo Git clone the OMAP Image Builder project. If you're unfamiliar with git, Atlassian has this great guide. git clone https://github.com/RobertCNelson/omap-image-builder.git &amp;&amp; cd omap-image-builder Step 2: Create a custom config Copy a config you like to a different name: cp configs/bb.org-debian-wheezy-console.conf configs/custom-image.conf In configs/custom-image.conf add or remove some packages from deb_include. I love htop, nmap, and moon-buggy, so I'm adding those. Change any of the other variables that you feel comfortable changing. Feel free to look at other configs for inspiration. ... deb_include=&quot;ca-certificates dosfstools dbus initramfs-tools linux-base \ openssh-server patch rsync sudo systemd wget htop nmap moon-buggy&quot; ... Step 3: Create a custom chroot script Copy a chroot script you like to a different name: cp target/chroot/beagleboard.org-console.sh target/chroot/custom-image.sh Open the config file you just made, and make sure to change chroot_script to point at your new script: chroot_script=&quot;custom-image.sh&quot; Ok, back to custom-image.sh. Let's install some more python packages. In your new config, find the function install_pip_pkg. Here it is in the original script. I like ipython and ipdb, so i'm going add those here: pip install Adafruit_BBIO ipython ipdb At the bottom of the script, uncomment #install_pip_pkgs. Step 4: Generate the root filesystem ./RootStock-NG.sh -c custom-image Get a coffee... this will take a while. Step 5: Generate an .img file Finished? No errors? Cool, let's make an image. The last step made a deploy/ directory. The root filesystem is in there. cd deploy In there you will see a folder with the name of the filesystem you created. If you used the bb.org-debian-wheezy-console.conf as your reference, it's probably something like debian-7.8-console-armhf. cd into that directory. In this directory you should see setup_sdcard.sh. Use that to make a eMMC flasher image. sudo ./setup_sdcard --img-2gb BBB-eMMC-flasher-debian-7.8-console-armhf --dtb beaglebone --boot_label BEAGLEBONE --enable-systemd --bbb-flasher --bbb-old-bootloader-in-emmc --hostname beaglebone&quot; This should generate an image file named BBB-eMMC-flasher-debian-7.8-console-armhf-2gb.img. Step 6: Compress that image file If you used the --img-2gb option, your .img file should be just shy of 2 GB. We should be able to compress that down to under 500 MB. To do so, do this: xz -z -8 -v BBB-eMMC-flasher-debian-7.8-console-armhf-2gb.img This takes a few minutes, but afterwards you'll have a much smaller file to distribute. End It is way easier to just install an OS using the provided images, and configure them after deploying. There is no shame in that. If you don't need a custom image, don't use one! But, for those scenarios that don't allow for using the stock images, I'm thankful that Robert Nelson has provided the OMAP Image Builder and made it simple to add new configs.

                   NS1:content=" (shrikant-sharat) AboutLabsArchivesTagsAtom Feed The ever useful and neat subprocess module 29 Apr, 2012 Python's subprocess module is one of my favourite modules in the standard library. If you have ever done some decent amount of coding in python, you might have encountered it. This module is used for dealing with external commands, intended to be a replacement to the old os.system and the like. The most trivial use might be to get the output of a small shell command like ls or ps. Not that this is the best way to get a list of files in a directory (think os.listdir), but you get the point. I am going to put my notes and experiences about this module here. Please note, I wrote this with Python 2.7 in mind. Things are slightly different in other versions (even 2.6). If you find any errors or suggestions, please let me know. A simple usage Popen class Running via the shell Getting the return code (aka exit status) IO Streams Reading error stream Watching both stdout and stderr Passing an environment Merge with current environment Unicode Execute in a different working directory Killing and dieing Auto-kill on death Launch commands in a terminal emulator Linux Windows Conclusion A simple usage For the sake of providing context, lets run the ls command from subprocess and get its output import subprocess ls_output = subprocess.check_output(['ls']) I'll cover getting output from a command in detail later. To give more command line arguments, subprocess.check_output(['ls', '-l']) The first item in the list is the executable and rest are its command line arguments (argv equivalent). No quirky shell quoting and complex nested quote rules to digest. Just a plain python list. However, not having shell quoting implies you don't also have the shell niceties. Like piping for one. The following won't work the way one would expect it to. subprocess.check_output(['ls', '|', 'wc', '-l']) Here, the ls command gets its first command as | and I have no idea what ls would do with it. Perhaps complain that no such file exists. So, instead, we have to use the shell boolean argument. More later down in the article. Popen class If there's just one thing in the subprocess module that you should be concerned with, its the Popen class. The other functions like call, check_output, and check_call use Popen internally. Here's the signature from the docs. class subprocess.Popen(args, bufsize=0, executable=None, stdin=None, stdout=None, stderr=None, preexec_fn=None, close_fds=False, shell=False, cwd=None, env=None, universal_newlines=False, startupinfo=None, creationflags=0) I suggest you read the docs for this class. As with all python docs, its really good. Running via the shell Subprocess can also run command-line instructions via a shell program. This is usually dash/bash on Linux and cmd on windows. subprocess.call('ls | wc -l', shell=True) Notice that in this case we pass a string, not a list. This is because we want the shell to interpret the whole of our command. You can even use shell style quoting if you like. It is up to the shell to decide how to best split the command line into executable and command line arguments. On windows, if you pass a list for args, it will be turned into a string using the same rules as the MS C runtime. See the doc-string for subprocess.list2cmdline for more on this. Whereas on unix-like systems, even if you pass a string, its turned into a list of one item :). The behaviour of the shell argument can sometimes be confusing so I'll try to clear it a bit here. Something I wished I had when I first encountered this module. Firstly, lets consider the case where shell is set to False, the default. In this case, if args is a string, it is assumed to be the name of the executable file. Even if it contains spaces. Consider the following. subprocess.call('ls -l') This won't work because subprocess is looking for an executable file called ls -l, but obviously can't find it. However, if args is a list, then the first item in this list is considered as the executable and the rest of the items in the list are passed as command line arguments to the program. subprocess.call(['ls', '-l']) does what you think it will. Second case, with shell set to True, the program that actually gets executed is the OS default shell, /bin/sh on Linux and cmd.exe on windows. This can be changed with the executable argument. When using the shell, args is usually a string, something that will be parsed by the shell program. The args string is passed as a command line argument to the shell (with a -c option on Linux) such that the shell will interpret it as a shell command sequence and process it accordingly. This means you can use all the shell builtins and goodies that your shell offers. subprocess.call('ls -l', shell=True) is similar to $ /bin/sh -c 'ls -l' In the same vein, if you pass a list as args with shell set to True, all items in the list are passed as command line arguments to the shell. subprocess.call(['ls', '-l'], shell=True) is similar to $ /bin/sh -c ls -l which is the same as $ /bin/sh -c ls since /bin/sh takes just the argument next to -c as the command line to execute. Getting the return code (aka exit status) If you want to run an external command and its return code is all you're concerned with, the call and check_call functions are what you're looking for. They both return the return code after running the command. The difference is, check_call raises a CalledProcessError if the return code is non-zero. If you've read the docs for these functions, you'll see that its not recommended to use stdout=PIPE or stderr=PIPE. And if you don't, the stdout and stderr of the command are just redirected to the parent's (Python VM in this case) streams. If that is not what you want, you have to use the Popen class. proc = Popen('ls') The moment the Popen class is instantiated, the command starts running. You can wait for it and after its done, access the return code via the returncode attribute. proc.wait() print proc.returncode If you are trying this out in a python REPL, you won't see a need to call .wait() since you can just wait yourself in the REPL till the command is finished and then access the returncode. Surprise! &gt;&gt;&gt; proc = Popen('ls') &gt;&gt;&gt; file1 file2 &gt;&gt;&gt; print proc.returncode None &gt;&gt;&gt; # wat? The command is definitely finished. Why don't we have a return code? &gt;&gt;&gt; proc.wait() 0 &gt;&gt;&gt; print proc.returncode 0 The reason for this is the returncode is not automatically set when a process ends. You have to call .wait or .poll to realize if the program is done and set the returncode attribute. IO Streams The simplest way to get the output of a command, as seen previously, is to use the check_output function. output = subprocess.check_output('ls') Notice the check_ prefix in the function name? Ring any bell? That's right, this function will raise a CalledProcessError if the return code is non-zero. This may not always be the best solution to get the output from a command. If you do get a CalledProcessError from this function call, unless you have the contents of stderr you probably have little idea what went wrong. You'll want to know what's written to the command's stderr. Reading error stream There are two ways to get the error output. First is redirecting stderr to stdout and only being concerned with stdout. This can be done by setting the stderr argument to subprocess.STDOUT. Second is to create a Popen object with stderr set to subprocess.PIPE (optionally along with stdout argument) and read from its stderr attribute which is a readable file-like object. There is also a convenience method on Popen class, called .communicate, which optionally takes a string to be sent to the process's stdin and returns a tuple of (stdout_content, stderr_content). Watching both stdout and stderr However, all of these assume that the command runs for some time, prints out a couple of lines of output and exits, so you can get the output(s) in strings. This is sometimes not the case. If you want to run a network intensive command like an svn checkout, which prints each file as and when downloaded, you need something better. The initial solution one can think of is this. proc = Popen('svn co svn+ssh://myrepo', stdout=PIPE) for line in proc.stdout: print line This works, for the most part. But, again, if there is an error, you'll want to read stderr too. It would be nice to read stdout and stderr simultaneously. Just like a shell seems to be doing. Alas, this remains a not so straightforward problem as of today, at least on non-Linux systems. On Linux (and where its supported), you can use the select module to keep an eye on multiple file-like stream objects. But this isn't available on windows. A more platform independent solution that I found works well, is using threads and a Queue. from subprocess import Popen, PIPE from threading import Thread from Queue import Queue, Empty io_q = Queue() def stream_watcher(identifier, stream): for line in stream: io_q.put((identifier, line)) if not stream.closed: stream.close() proc = Popen('svn co svn+ssh://myrepo', stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE) Thread(target=stream_watcher, name='stdout-watcher', args=('STDOUT', proc.stdout)).start() Thread(target=stream_watcher, name='stderr-watcher', args=('STDERR', proc.stderr)).start() def printer(): while True: try: # Block for 1 second. item = io_q.get(True, 1) except Empty: # No output in either streams for a second. Are we done? if proc.poll() is not None: break else: identifier, line = item print identifier + ':', line Thread(target=printer, name='printer').start() Fair bit of code. This is a typical producer-consumer thing. Two threads producing lines of output (one each from stdout and stderr) and pushing them into a queue. One thread watching the queue and printing the lines until the process itself finishes. Passing an environment The env argument to Popen (and others) lets you customize the environment of the command being run. If it is not set, or is set to None, the current process's environment is used, just as documented. You might not agree with me, but I feel there are some subtleties with this argument that should have been mentioned in the documentation. Merge with current environment One is that if you provide a mapping to env, whatever is in this mapping is all that's available to the command being run. For example, if you don't give a TOP_ARG in the env mapping, the command won't see a TOP_ARG in its environment. So, I frequently find myself doing this p = Popen('command', env=dict(os.environ, my_env_prop='value')) This makes sense once you realize it, but I wish it were at least hinted at in the documentation. Unicode Another one, is to do with Unicode (Surprise surprise!). And windows. If you use unicodes in the env mapping, you get an error saying you can only use strings in the environment mapping. The worst part about this error is that it only seems to happen on windows and not on Linux. If its an error to use unicodes in this place, I wish it break on both platforms. This issue is very painful if you're like me and use unicodeall the time. from __future__ import unicode_literals That line is present in all my python source files. The error message doesn't even bother to mention that you have unicodes in your env so it's very hard to understand what's going wrong. Execute in a different working directory This is handled by the cwd argument. You set the location of the directory which you want as the working directory of the program you are launching. The docs do mention that the working directory is changed before the command even starts running. But that you can't specify program's path relative to the cwd. In reality, I found that you can do this. Either I'm missing something with this or the docs really are inaccurate. Anyway, this works subprocess.call('./ls', cwd='/bin') Prints out all the files in /bin. Of course, the following doesn't work when the working directory is not /bin. subprocess.call('./ls') So, if you are giving something explicitly to cwd and are using a relative path for the executable, this is something to keep in mind. Killing and dieing A simple proc.terminate() or for some dramatic umphh! proc.kill() will do the trick to end the process. As noted in the documentation, the former sends a SIGTERM and later sends a SIGKILL on unix, but both do some native windows-y thing on windows. Auto-kill on death The processes you start in your python program, stay running even after your program exits. This is usually what you want, but when you want all your sub processes killed automatically on exit with Ctrl+C or the like, you have to use the atexit module. procs = [] @atexit.register def kill_subprocesses(): for proc in procs: proc.kill() And add all the Popen objects created to the procs list. This is the only solution I found that works best. Launch commands in a terminal emulator On one occasion, I had to write a script that would launch multiple svn checkouts and then run many ant builds (~20-35) on the checked out projects. In my opinion, the best and easiest way to do this is to fire up multiple terminal emulator windows each running an individual checkout/ant-build. This allows us to monitor each process and even cancel any of them by simply closing the corresponding terminal emulator window. Linux This is pretty trivial actually. On Linux, you can use xterm for this. Popen(['xterm', '-e', 'sleep 3s']) Windows On windows, its not as straight forward. The first solution for this would be Popen(['cmd', '/K', 'command']) /K option tells cmd to run the command and keep the command window from closing. You may use /C instead to close the command window after the command finishes. As simple as it looks, it has some weird behavior. I don't completely understand it, but I'll try to explain what I have. When you try to run a python script with the above Popen call, in a command window like this python main.py you don't see a new command window pop up. Instead, the sub command runs in the same command window. I have no idea what happens when you run multiple sub commands this way. (I have only limited access to windows). If instead you run it in something like an IDE or IDLE (F5), you have a new command window open up. I believe one each for each command you run this way. Just the way you expect. But I gave up on cmd.exe for this purpose and learnt to use the mintty utility that comes with cygwin (I think 1.7+). mintty is awesome. Really. Its been a while since I felt that way about a command line utility on windows. Popen(['mintty', '--hold', 'error', '--exec', 'command']) This. A new mintty console window opens up running the command and it closes automatically, if the command exits with zero status (that's what --hold error does). Otherwise, it stays on. Very useful. Conclusion The subprocess module is a very useful thing. Spend some time understanding it better. This is my attempt at helping people with it, and turned out to be way longer than I'd expected. If there are any inaccuracies in this, or if you have anything to add, please leave a comment. Comments (shrikant-sharat) © Shrikant Sharat Kandula 2013.

Interprocess Communication and Networking » 17.2. socket — Low-level networking interface¶ This module provides access to the BSD socket interface. It is available on all modern Unix systems, Windows, Mac OS X, BeOS, OS/2, and probably additional platforms. Note Some behavior may be platform dependent, since calls are made to the operating system socket APIs. For an introduction to socket programming (in C), see the following papers: An Introductory 4.3BSD Interprocess Communication Tutorial, by Stuart Sechrest and An Advanced 4.3BSD Interprocess Communication Tutorial, by Samuel J. Leffler et al, both in the UNIX Programmer’s Manual, Supplementary Documents 1 (sections PS1:7 and PS1:8). The platform-specific reference material for the various socket-related system calls are also a valuable source of information on the details of socket semantics. For Unix, refer to the manual pages; for Windows, see the WinSock (or Winsock 2) specification. For IPv6-ready APIs, readers may want to refer to RFC 3493 titled Basic Socket Interface Extensions for IPv6. The Python interface is a straightforward transliteration of the Unix system call and library interface for sockets to Python’s object-oriented style: the socket() function returns a socket object whose methods implement the various socket system calls. Parameter types are somewhat higher-level than in the C interface: as with read() and write() operations on Python files, buffer allocation on receive operations is automatic, and buffer length is implicit on send operations. Socket addresses are represented as follows: A single string is used for the AF_UNIX address family. A pair (host, port) is used for the AF_INET address family, where host is a string representing either a hostname in Internet domain notation like 'daring.cwi.nl' or an IPv4 address like '100.50.200.5', and port is an integer. For AF_INET6 address family, a four-tuple (host, port, flowinfo, scopeid) is used, where flowinfo and scopeid represents sin6_flowinfo and sin6_scope_id member in struct sockaddr_in6 in C. For socket module methods, flowinfo and scopeid can be omitted just for backward compatibility. Note, however, omission of scopeid can cause problems in manipulating scoped IPv6 addresses. Other address families are currently not supported. The address format required by a particular socket object is automatically selected based on the address family specified when the socket object was created. For IPv4 addresses, two special forms are accepted instead of a host address: the empty string represents INADDR_ANY, and the string '&lt;broadcast&gt;' represents INADDR_BROADCAST. The behavior is not available for IPv6 for backward compatibility, therefore, you may want to avoid these if you intend to support IPv6 with your Python programs. If you use a hostname in the host portion of IPv4/v6 socket address, the program may show a nondeterministic behavior, as Python uses the first address returned from the DNS resolution. The socket address will be resolved differently into an actual IPv4/v6 address, depending on the results from DNS resolution and/or the host configuration. For deterministic behavior use a numeric address in host portion. New in version 2.5: AF_NETLINK sockets are represented as pairs pid, groups. New in version 2.6: Linux-only support for TIPC is also available using the AF_TIPC address family. TIPC is an open, non-IP based networked protocol designed for use in clustered computer environments. Addresses are represented by a tuple, and the fields depend on the address type. The general tuple form is (addr_type, v1, v2, v3 [, scope]), where: addr_type is one of TIPC_ADDR_NAMESEQ, TIPC_ADDR_NAME, or TIPC_ADDR_ID. scope is one of TIPC_ZONE_SCOPE, TIPC_CLUSTER_SCOPE, and TIPC_NODE_SCOPE. If addr_type is TIPC_ADDR_NAME, then v1 is the server type, v2 is the port identifier, and v3 should be 0. If addr_type is TIPC_ADDR_NAMESEQ, then v1 is the server type, v2 is the lower port number, and v3 is the upper port number. If addr_type is TIPC_ADDR_ID, then v1 is the node, v2 is the reference, and v3 should be set to 0. All errors raise exceptions. The normal exceptions for invalid argument types and out-of-memory conditions can be raised; errors related to socket or address semantics raise the error socket.error. Non-blocking mode is supported through setblocking(). A generalization of this based on timeouts is supported through settimeout(). The module socket exports the following constants and functions: exception socket.error¶ This exception is raised for socket-related errors. The accompanying value is either a string telling what went wrong or a pair (errno, string) representing an error returned by a system call, similar to the value accompanying os.error. See the module errno, which contains names for the error codes defined by the underlying operating system. Changed in version 2.6: socket.error is now a child class of IOError. exception socket.herror¶ This exception is raised for address-related errors, i.e. for functions that use h_errno in the C API, including gethostbyname_ex() and gethostbyaddr(). The accompanying value is a pair (h_errno, string) representing an error returned by a library call. string represents the description of h_errno, as returned by the hstrerror() C function. exception socket.gaierror¶ This exception is raised for address-related errors, for getaddrinfo() and getnameinfo(). The accompanying value is a pair (error, string) representing an error returned by a library call. string represents the description of error, as returned by the gai_strerror() C function. The error value will match one of the EAI_* constants defined in this module. exception socket.timeout¶ This exception is raised when a timeout occurs on a socket which has had timeouts enabled via a prior call to settimeout(). The accompanying value is a string whose value is currently always “timed out”. New in version 2.3. socket.AF_UNIX¶ socket.AF_INET¶ socket.AF_INET6¶ These constants represent the address (and protocol) families, used for the first argument to socket(). If the AF_UNIX constant is not defined then this protocol is unsupported. socket.SOCK_STREAM¶ socket.SOCK_DGRAM¶ socket.SOCK_RAW¶ socket.SOCK_RDM¶ socket.SOCK_SEQPACKET¶ These constants represent the socket types, used for the second argument to socket(). (Only SOCK_STREAM and SOCK_DGRAM appear to be generally useful.) SO_* socket.SOMAXCONN¶ MSG_* SOL_* IPPROTO_* IPPORT_* INADDR_* IP_* IPV6_* EAI_* AI_* NI_* TCP_* Many constants of these forms, documented in the Unix documentation on sockets and/or the IP protocol, are also defined in the socket module. They are generally used in arguments to the setsockopt() and getsockopt() methods of socket objects. In most cases, only those symbols that are defined in the Unix header files are defined; for a few symbols, default values are provided. SIO_* RCVALL_* Constants for Windows’ WSAIoctl(). The constants are used as arguments to the ioctl() method of socket objects. New in version 2.6. TIPC_* TIPC related constants, matching the ones exported by the C socket API. See the TIPC documentation for more information. New in version 2.6. socket.has_ipv6¶ This constant contains a boolean value which indicates if IPv6 is supported on this platform. New in version 2.3. socket.create_connection(address[, timeout[, source_address]])¶ Connect to a TCP service listening on the Internet address (a 2-tuple (host, port)), and return the socket object. This is a higher-level function than socket.connect(): if host is a non-numeric hostname, it will try to resolve it for both AF_INET and AF_INET6, and then try to connect to all possible addresses in turn until a connection succeeds. This makes it easy to write clients that are compatible to both IPv4 and IPv6. Passing the optional timeout parameter will set the timeout on the socket instance before attempting to connect. If no timeout is supplied, the global default timeout setting returned by getdefaulttimeout() is used. If supplied, source_address must be a 2-tuple (host, port) for the socket to bind to as its source address before connecting. If host or port are ‘’ or 0 respectively the OS default behavior will be used. New in version 2.6. Changed in version 2.7: source_address was added. socket.getaddrinfo(host, port[, family[, socktype[, proto[, flags]]]])¶ Translate the host/port argument into a sequence of 5-tuples that contain all the necessary arguments for creating a socket connected to that service. host is a domain name, a string representation of an IPv4/v6 address or None. port is a string service name such as 'http', a numeric port number or None. By passing None as the value of host and port, you can pass NULL to the underlying C API. The family, socktype and proto arguments can be optionally specified in order to narrow the list of addresses returned. By default, their value is 0, meaning that the full range of results is selected. The flags argument can be one or several of the AI_* constants, and will influence how results are computed and returned. Its default value is 0. For example, AI_NUMERICHOST will disable domain name resolution and will raise an error if host is a domain name. The function returns a list of 5-tuples with the following structure: (family, socktype, proto, canonname, sockaddr) In these tuples, family, socktype, proto are all integers and are meant to be passed to the socket() function. canonname will be a string representing the canonical name of the host if AI_CANONNAME is part of the flags argument; else canonname will be empty. sockaddr is a tuple describing a socket address, whose format depends on the returned family (a (address, port) 2-tuple for AF_INET, a (address, port, flow info, scope id) 4-tuple for AF_INET6), and is meant to be passed to the socket.connect() method. The following example fetches address information for a hypothetical TCP connection to example.org on port 80 (results may differ on your system if IPv6 isn’t enabled): &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; socket.getaddrinfo(&quot;example.org&quot;, 80, 0, 0, socket.IPPROTO_TCP) [(10, 1, 6, '', ('2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946', 80, 0, 0)), (2, 1, 6, '', ('93.184.216.34', 80))] New in version 2.2. socket.getfqdn([name])¶ Return a fully qualified domain name for name. If name is omitted or empty, it is interpreted as the local host. To find the fully qualified name, the hostname returned by gethostbyaddr() is checked, followed by aliases for the host, if available. The first name which includes a period is selected. In case no fully qualified domain name is available, the hostname as returned by gethostname() is returned. New in version 2.0. socket.gethostbyname(hostname)¶ Translate a host name to IPv4 address format. The IPv4 address is returned as a string, such as '100.50.200.5'. If the host name is an IPv4 address itself it is returned unchanged. See gethostbyname_ex() for a more complete interface. gethostbyname() does not support IPv6 name resolution, and getaddrinfo() should be used instead for IPv4/v6 dual stack support. socket.gethostbyname_ex(hostname)¶ Translate a host name to IPv4 address format, extended interface. Return a triple (hostname, aliaslist, ipaddrlist) where hostname is the primary host name responding to the given ip_address, aliaslist is a (possibly empty) list of alternative host names for the same address, and ipaddrlist is a list of IPv4 addresses for the same interface on the same host (often but not always a single address). gethostbyname_ex() does not support IPv6 name resolution, and getaddrinfo() should be used instead for IPv4/v6 dual stack support. socket.gethostname()¶ Return a string containing the hostname of the machine where the Python interpreter is currently executing. If you want to know the current machine’s IP address, you may want to use gethostbyname(gethostname()). This operation assumes that there is a valid address-to-host mapping for the host, and the assumption does not always hold. Note: gethostname() doesn’t always return the fully qualified domain name; use getfqdn() (see above). socket.gethostbyaddr(ip_address)¶ Return a triple (hostname, aliaslist, ipaddrlist) where hostname is the primary host name responding to the given ip_address, aliaslist is a (possibly empty) list of alternative host names for the same address, and ipaddrlist is a list of IPv4/v6 addresses for the same interface on the same host (most likely containing only a single address). To find the fully qualified domain name, use the function getfqdn(). gethostbyaddr() supports both IPv4 and IPv6. socket.getnameinfo(sockaddr, flags)¶ Translate a socket address sockaddr into a 2-tuple (host, port). Depending on the settings of flags, the result can contain a fully-qualified domain name or numeric address representation in host. Similarly, port can contain a string port name or a numeric port number. New in version 2.2. socket.getprotobyname(protocolname)¶ Translate an Internet protocol name (for example, 'icmp') to a constant suitable for passing as the (optional) third argument to the socket() function. This is usually only needed for sockets opened in “raw” mode (SOCK_RAW); for the normal socket modes, the correct protocol is chosen automatically if the protocol is omitted or zero. socket.getservbyname(servicename[, protocolname])¶ Translate an Internet service name and protocol name to a port number for that service. The optional protocol name, if given, should be 'tcp' or 'udp', otherwise any protocol will match. socket.getservbyport(port[, protocolname])¶ Translate an Internet port number and protocol name to a service name for that service. The optional protocol name, if given, should be 'tcp' or 'udp', otherwise any protocol will match. socket.socket([family[, type[, proto]]])¶ Create a new socket using the given address family, socket type and protocol number. The address family should be AF_INET (the default), AF_INET6 or AF_UNIX. The socket type should be SOCK_STREAM (the default), SOCK_DGRAM or perhaps one of the other SOCK_ constants. The protocol number is usually zero and may be omitted in that case. socket.socketpair([family[, type[, proto]]])¶ Build a pair of connected socket objects using the given address family, socket type, and protocol number. Address family, socket type, and protocol number are as for the socket() function above. The default family is AF_UNIX if defined on the platform; otherwise, the default is AF_INET. Availability: Unix. New in version 2.4. socket.fromfd(fd, family, type[, proto])¶ Duplicate the file descriptor fd (an integer as returned by a file object’s fileno() method) and build a socket object from the result. Address family, socket type and protocol number are as for the socket() function above. The file descriptor should refer to a socket, but this is not checked — subsequent operations on the object may fail if the file descriptor is invalid. This function is rarely needed, but can be used to get or set socket options on a socket passed to a program as standard input or output (such as a server started by the Unix inet daemon). The socket is assumed to be in blocking mode. Availability: Unix. socket.ntohl(x)¶ Convert 32-bit positive integers from network to host byte order. On machines where the host byte order is the same as network byte order, this is a no-op; otherwise, it performs a 4-byte swap operation. socket.ntohs(x)¶ Convert 16-bit positive integers from network to host byte order. On machines where the host byte order is the same as network byte order, this is a no-op; otherwise, it performs a 2-byte swap operation. socket.htonl(x)¶ Convert 32-bit positive integers from host to network byte order. On machines where the host byte order is the same as network byte order, this is a no-op; otherwise, it performs a 4-byte swap operation. socket.htons(x)¶ Convert 16-bit positive integers from host to network byte order. On machines where the host byte order is the same as network byte order, this is a no-op; otherwise, it performs a 2-byte swap operation. socket.inet_aton(ip_string)¶ Convert an IPv4 address from dotted-quad string format (for example, ‘123.45.67.89’) to 32-bit packed binary format, as a string four characters in length. This is useful when conversing with a program that uses the standard C library and needs objects of type struct in_addr, which is the C type for the 32-bit packed binary this function returns. inet_aton() also accepts strings with less than three dots; see the Unix manual page inet(3) for details. If the IPv4 address string passed to this function is invalid, socket.error will be raised. Note that exactly what is valid depends on the underlying C implementation of inet_aton(). inet_aton() does not support IPv6, and inet_pton() should be used instead for IPv4/v6 dual stack support. socket.inet_ntoa(packed_ip)¶ Convert a 32-bit packed IPv4 address (a string four characters in length) to its standard dotted-quad string representation (for example, ‘123.45.67.89’). This is useful when conversing with a program that uses the standard C library and needs objects of type struct in_addr, which is the C type for the 32-bit packed binary data this function takes as an argument. If the string passed to this function is not exactly 4 bytes in length, socket.error will be raised. inet_ntoa() does not support IPv6, and inet_ntop() should be used instead for IPv4/v6 dual stack support. socket.inet_pton(address_family, ip_string)¶ Convert an IP address from its family-specific string format to a packed, binary format. inet_pton() is useful when a library or network protocol calls for an object of type struct in_addr (similar to inet_aton()) or struct in6_addr. Supported values for address_family are currently AF_INET and AF_INET6. If the IP address string ip_string is invalid, socket.error will be raised. Note that exactly what is valid depends on both the value of address_family and the underlying implementation of inet_pton(). Availability: Unix (maybe not all platforms). New in version 2.3. socket.inet_ntop(address_family, packed_ip)¶ Convert a packed IP address (a string of some number of characters) to its standard, family-specific string representation (for example, '7.10.0.5' or '5aef:2b::8') inet_ntop() is useful when a library or network protocol returns an object of type struct in_addr (similar to inet_ntoa()) or struct in6_addr. Supported values for address_family are currently AF_INET and AF_INET6. If the string packed_ip is not the correct length for the specified address family, ValueError will be raised. A socket.error is raised for errors from the call to inet_ntop(). Availability: Unix (maybe not all platforms). New in version 2.3. socket.getdefaulttimeout()¶ Return the default timeout in seconds (float) for new socket objects. A value of None indicates that new socket objects have no timeout. When the socket module is first imported, the default is None. New in version 2.3. socket.setdefaulttimeout(timeout)¶ Set the default timeout in seconds (float) for new socket objects. A value of None indicates that new socket objects have no timeout. When the socket module is first imported, the default is None. New in version 2.3. socket.SocketType¶ This is a Python type object that represents the socket object type. It is the same as type(socket(...)). See also Module SocketServer Classes that simplify writing network servers. Module ssl A TLS/SSL wrapper for socket objects. 17.2.1. Socket Objects¶ Socket objects have the following methods. Except for makefile() these correspond to Unix system calls applicable to sockets. socket.accept()¶ Accept a connection. The socket must be bound to an address and listening for connections. The return value is a pair (conn, address) where conn is a new socket object usable to send and receive data on the connection, and address is the address bound to the socket on the other end of the connection. socket.bind(address)¶ Bind the socket to address. The socket must not already be bound. (The format of address depends on the address family — see above.) Note This method has historically accepted a pair of parameters for AF_INET addresses instead of only a tuple. This was never intentional and is no longer available in Python 2.0 and later. socket.close()¶ Close the socket. All future operations on the socket object will fail. The remote end will receive no more data (after queued data is flushed). Sockets are automatically closed when they are garbage-collected. Note close() releases the resource associated with a connection but does not necessarily close the connection immediately. If you want to close the connection in a timely fashion, call shutdown() before close(). socket.connect(address)¶ Connect to a remote socket at address. (The format of address depends on the address family — see above.) Note This method has historically accepted a pair of parameters for AF_INET addresses instead of only a tuple. This was never intentional and is no longer available in Python 2.0 and later. socket.connect_ex(address)¶ Like connect(address), but return an error indicator instead of raising an exception for errors returned by the C-level connect() call (other problems, such as “host not found,” can still raise exceptions). The error indicator is 0 if the operation succeeded, otherwise the value of the errno variable. This is useful to support, for example, asynchronous connects. Note This method has historically accepted a pair of parameters for AF_INET addresses instead of only a tuple. This was never intentional and is no longer available in Python 2.0 and later. socket.fileno()¶ Return the socket’s file descriptor (a small integer). This is useful with select.select(). Under Windows the small integer returned by this method cannot be used where a file descriptor can be used (such as os.fdopen()). Unix does not have this limitation. socket.getpeername()¶ Return the remote address to which the socket is connected. This is useful to find out the port number of a remote IPv4/v6 socket, for instance. (The format of the address returned depends on the address family — see above.) On some systems this function is not supported. socket.getsockname()¶ Return the socket’s own address. This is useful to find out the port number of an IPv4/v6 socket, for instance. (The format of the address returned depends on the address family — see above.) socket.getsockopt(level, optname[, buflen])¶ Return the value of the given socket option (see the Unix man page getsockopt(2)). The needed symbolic constants (SO_* etc.) are defined in this module. If buflen is absent, an integer option is assumed and its integer value is returned by the function. If buflen is present, it specifies the maximum length of the buffer used to receive the option in, and this buffer is returned as a string. It is up to the caller to decode the contents of the buffer (see the optional built-in module struct for a way to decode C structures encoded as strings). socket.ioctl(control, option)¶ Platform: Windows The ioctl() method is a limited interface to the WSAIoctl system interface. Please refer to the Win32 documentation for more information. On other platforms, the generic fcntl.fcntl() and fcntl.ioctl() functions may be used; they accept a socket object as their first argument. New in version 2.6. socket.listen(backlog)¶ Listen for connections made to the socket. The backlog argument specifies the maximum number of queued connections and should be at least 0; the maximum value is system-dependent (usually 5), the minimum value is forced to 0. socket.makefile([mode[, bufsize]])¶ Return a file object associated with the socket. (File objects are described in File Objects.) The file object does not close the socket explicitly when its close() method is called, but only removes its reference to the socket object, so that the socket will be closed if it is not referenced from anywhere else. The socket must be in blocking mode (it can not have a timeout). The optional mode and bufsize arguments are interpreted the same way as by the built-in file() function. Note On Windows, the file-like object created by makefile() cannot be used where a file object with a file descriptor is expected, such as the stream arguments of subprocess.Popen(). socket.recv(bufsize[, flags])¶ Receive data from the socket. The return value is a string representing the data received. The maximum amount of data to be received at once is specified by bufsize. See the Unix manual page recv(2) for the meaning of the optional argument flags; it defaults to zero. Note For best match with hardware and network realities, the value of bufsize should be a relatively small power of 2, for example, 4096. socket.recvfrom(bufsize[, flags])¶ Receive data from the socket. The return value is a pair (string, address) where string is a string representing the data received and address is the address of the socket sending the data. See the Unix manual page recv(2) for the meaning of the optional argument flags; it defaults to zero. (The format of address depends on the address family — see above.) socket.recvfrom_into(buffer[, nbytes[, flags]])¶ Receive data from the socket, writing it into buffer instead of creating a new string. The return value is a pair (nbytes, address) where nbytes is the number of bytes received and address is the address of the socket sending the data. See the Unix manual page recv(2) for the meaning of the optional argument flags; it defaults to zero. (The format of address depends on the address family — see above.) New in version 2.5. socket.recv_into(buffer[, nbytes[, flags]])¶ Receive up to nbytes bytes from the socket, storing the data into a buffer rather than creating a new string. If nbytes is not specified (or 0), receive up to the size available in the given buffer. Returns the number of bytes received. See the Unix manual page recv(2) for the meaning of the optional argument flags; it defaults to zero. New in version 2.5. socket.send(string[, flags])¶ Send data to the socket. The socket must be connected to a remote socket. The optional flags argument has the same meaning as for recv() above. Returns the number of bytes sent. Applications are responsible for checking that all data has been sent; if only some of the data was transmitted, the application needs to attempt delivery of the remaining data. For further information on this concept, consult the Socket Programming HOWTO. socket.sendall(string[, flags])¶ Send data to the socket. The socket must be connected to a remote socket. The optional flags argument has the same meaning as for recv() above. Unlike send(), this method continues to send data from string until either all data has been sent or an error occurs. None is returned on success. On error, an exception is raised, and there is no way to determine how much data, if any, was successfully sent. socket.sendto(string, address)¶ socket.sendto(string, flags, address) Send data to the socket. The socket should not be connected to a remote socket, since the destination socket is specified by address. The optional flags argument has the same meaning as for recv() above. Return the number of bytes sent. (The format of address depends on the address family — see above.) socket.setblocking(flag)¶ Set blocking or non-blocking mode of the socket: if flag is 0, the socket is set to non-blocking, else to blocking mode. Initially all sockets are in blocking mode. In non-blocking mode, if a recv() call doesn’t find any data, or if a send() call can’t immediately dispose of the data, a error exception is raised; in blocking mode, the calls block until they can proceed. s.setblocking(0) is equivalent to s.settimeout(0.0); s.setblocking(1) is equivalent to s.settimeout(None). socket.settimeout(value)¶ Set a timeout on blocking socket operations. The value argument can be a nonnegative float expressing seconds, or None. If a float is given, subsequent socket operations will raise a timeout exception if the timeout period value has elapsed before the operation has completed. Setting a timeout of None disables timeouts on socket operations. s.settimeout(0.0) is equivalent to s.setblocking(0); s.settimeout(None) is equivalent to s.setblocking(1). New in version 2.3. socket.gettimeout()¶ Return the timeout in seconds (float) associated with socket operations, or None if no timeout is set. This reflects the last call to setblocking() or settimeout(). New in version 2.3. Some notes on socket blocking and timeouts: A socket object can be in one of three modes: blocking, non-blocking, or timeout. Sockets are always created in blocking mode. In blocking mode, operations block until complete or the system returns an error (such as connection timed out). In non-blocking mode, operations fail (with an error that is unfortunately system-dependent) if they cannot be completed immediately. In timeout mode, operations fail if they cannot be completed within the timeout specified for the socket or if the system returns an error. The setblocking() method is simply a shorthand for certain settimeout() calls. Timeout mode internally sets the socket in non-blocking mode. The blocking and timeout modes are shared between file descriptors and socket objects that refer to the same network endpoint. A consequence of this is that file objects returned by the makefile() method must only be used when the socket is in blocking mode; in timeout or non-blocking mode file operations that cannot be completed immediately will fail. Note that the connect() operation is subject to the timeout setting, and in general it is recommended to call settimeout() before calling connect() or pass a timeout parameter to create_connection(). The system network stack may return a connection timeout error of its own regardless of any Python socket timeout setting. socket.setsockopt(level, optname, value)¶ Set the value of the given socket option (see the Unix manual page setsockopt(2)). The needed symbolic constants are defined in the socket module (SO_* etc.). The value can be an integer or a string representing a buffer. In the latter case it is up to the caller to ensure that the string contains the proper bits (see the optional built-in module struct for a way to encode C structures as strings). socket.shutdown(how)¶ Shut down one or both halves of the connection. If how is SHUT_RD, further receives are disallowed. If how is SHUT_WR, further sends are disallowed. If how is SHUT_RDWR, further sends and receives are disallowed. Depending on the platform, shutting down one half of the connection can also close the opposite half (e.g. on Mac OS X, shutdown(SHUT_WR) does not allow further reads on the other end of the connection). Note that there are no methods read() or write(); use recv() and send() without flags argument instead. Socket objects also have these (read-only) attributes that correspond to the values given to the socket constructor. socket.family¶ The socket family. New in version 2.5. socket.type¶ The socket type. New in version 2.5. socket.proto¶ The socket protocol. New in version 2.5. 17.2.2. Example¶ Here are four minimal example programs using the TCP/IP protocol: a server that echoes all data that it receives back (servicing only one client), and a client using it. Note that a server must perform the sequence socket(), bind(), listen(), accept() (possibly repeating the accept() to service more than one client), while a client only needs the sequence socket(), connect(). Also note that the server does not sendall()/recv() on the socket it is listening on but on the new socket returned by accept(). The first two examples support IPv4 only. # Echo server program import socket HOST = '' # Symbolic name meaning all available interfaces PORT = 50007 # Arbitrary non-privileged port s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) s.bind((HOST, PORT)) s.listen(1) conn, addr = s.accept() print 'Connected by', addr while 1: data = conn.recv(1024) if not data: break conn.sendall(data) conn.close() # Echo client program import socket HOST = 'daring.cwi.nl' # The remote host PORT = 50007 # The same port as used by the server s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) s.connect((HOST, PORT)) s.sendall('Hello, world') data = s.recv(1024) s.close() print 'Received', repr(data) The next two examples are identical to the above two, but support both IPv4 and IPv6. The server side will listen to the first address family available (it should listen to both instead). On most of IPv6-ready systems, IPv6 will take precedence and the server may not accept IPv4 traffic. The client side will try to connect to the all addresses returned as a result of the name resolution, and sends traffic to the first one connected successfully. # Echo server program import socket import sys HOST = None # Symbolic name meaning all available interfaces PORT = 50007 # Arbitrary non-privileged port s = None for res in socket.getaddrinfo(HOST, PORT, socket.AF_UNSPEC, socket.SOCK_STREAM, 0, socket.AI_PASSIVE): af, socktype, proto, canonname, sa = res try: s = socket.socket(af, socktype, proto) except socket.error as msg: s = None continue try: s.bind(sa) s.listen(1) except socket.error as msg: s.close() s = None continue break if s is None: print 'could not open socket' sys.exit(1) conn, addr = s.accept() print 'Connected by', addr while 1: data = conn.recv(1024) if not data: break conn.send(data) conn.close() # Echo client program import socket import sys HOST = 'daring.cwi.nl' # The remote host PORT = 50007 # The same port as used by the server s = None for res in socket.getaddrinfo(HOST, PORT, socket.AF_UNSPEC, socket.SOCK_STREAM): af, socktype, proto, canonname, sa = res try: s = socket.socket(af, socktype, proto) except socket.error as msg: s = None continue try: s.connect(sa) except socket.error as msg: s.close() s = None continue break if s is None: print 'could not open socket' sys.exit(1) s.sendall('Hello, world') data = s.recv(1024) s.close() print 'Received', repr(data) The last example shows how to write a very simple network sniffer with raw sockets on Windows. The example requires administrator privileges to modify the interface: import socket # the public network interface HOST = socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname()) # create a raw socket and bind it to the public interface s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_RAW, socket.IPPROTO_IP) s.bind((HOST, 0)) # Include IP headers s.setsockopt(socket.IPPROTO_IP, socket.IP_HDRINCL, 1) # receive all packages s.ioctl(socket.SIO_RCVALL, socket.RCVALL_ON) # receive a package print s.recvfrom(65565) # disabled promiscuous mode s.ioctl(socket.SIO_RCVALL, socket.RCVALL_OFF) Running an example several times with too small delay between executions, could lead to this error: socket.error: [Errno 98] Address already in use This is because the previous execution has left the socket in a TIME_WAIT state, and can’t be immediately reused.

There are many guides available using the now defunct sakis3g script, but getting my modem to work required a bit more understanding. The main problem is that most USB modems act as two devices - a USB storage device and a USB modem. When plugged in to the Raspberry PI the device is usually in USB storage mode. There is a program called usb_modeswitch that we can use to do the switching The other missing part is a way to connect to the cellular network with the USB modem from the Raspberry. For this we will use the classic ppp and wvdial programs. Requirements Raspberry PI computer Raspbian OS installed USB 3G Modem 5V 1A power supply for the Raspberry PI 1. Install required software Connect your Raspberry PI to the internet via LAN or Wifi Open a terminal window and enter: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install ppp usb-modeswitch wvdial 2. Get the USB switching codes We need to get the codes of the USB device in USB storage mode and USB modem mode. Connect your USB modem and reboot the Raspberry PI without LAN or Wifi connection Once rebooted open a terminal window and enter: lsusb The output will look similar to the screenshot below. Your modem should be listed as one of the USB devices. Note the numbers underlined. These are the device vendor and product codes. Make a note of these numbers. In this case it is 19d2:2000 This value will later be used in the DefaultProduct value Then we need to soft reboot the Rapberry PI with the modem connected. Open a terminal window and enter: sudo reboot Once rebooted open a terminal window and enter: lsusb The output will look similar to the screenshot below. Your modem should be listed and if you are lucky the second set of numbers would have changed. This is usb_modeswitch doing it's job and switching the device to USB modem mode. Make a note of the new numbers. In this case it is 19d2:2002 This value will be used later in the TargetProduct value 3. Create custom usb_modeswitch config file We need to create a custom config file for usb_modeswitch on the Raspberry PI because on a cold boot the device is not always active yet when usb_modeswitch runs on startup and the device is left in USB storage mode. We will extract some more information for our usb_modeswitch config file so that we can do the switching manually. Open a terminal window and enter the following replacing the codes 19d2 and 2000 with the codes you noted in step 2. Also note the added backslash. cd /tmp tar -xzvf /usr/share/usb_modeswitch/configPack.tar.gz 19d2\:2000 Now open the extracted file with a text editor like leafpad replacing the codes noted in step 2. leafpad 19d2:2000 The content of the file should look something similar to the screenshot below. The parts we are interested in are shown in blue. Now open the /etc/usb_modeswitch.conf file and add the information obtained above to the file. Open a terminal window and enter: sudo leafpad /etc/usb_modeswitch.conf Then add the following replacing the codes and MessageContent values with those of your device and save. DefaultVendor=0x19d2 DefaultProduct=0x2000 TargetVendor=0x19d2 TargetProduct=0x2002 MessageContent=&quot;5553424312345678000000000000061e000000000000000000000000000000&quot; MessageContent2=&quot;5553424312345679000000000000061b000000020000000000000000000000&quot; MessageContent3=&quot;55534243123456702000000080000c85010101180101010101000000000000&quot; 4. Create the wvdial config file The next step is to create a config file for wvdial so you can connect to your service provider. Open a terminal window and enter: sudo leafpad /etc/wvdial.conf Replace the content of the file with the following. [Dialer 3gconnect] Init1 = ATZ Init2 = ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &amp;C1 &amp;D2 +FCLASS=0 Init3 = AT+CGDCONT=1,&quot;IP&quot;,&quot;internet&quot; Stupid Mode = 1 Modem Type = Analog Modem ISDN = 0 Phone = *99# Modem = /dev/gsmmodem Username = { } Password = { } Baud = 460800 Replace internet with your service provider's APN Replace the Phone number if you need to dial a different code to connect. Replace Username and Password if needed. To leave the username and password as blank use { } 5. Connect to the internet To connect we need to make sure the device is in modem mode. Open a terminal and enter: sudo usb_modeswitch -c /etc/usb_modeswitch.conf Then connect to the internet with: wvdial 3gconnect Tags: Raspberry Pi Raspbian 3G USB 3G Modem wvdial usb_modeswitch GSM Mobile Broadband Networking 276177 reads Comments Hi.

Your name Subject Comment * Leave this field blank If your service provider Submitted by The Fan Club on Sat, 2013-11-23 23:19 If your service provider allows your 3G USB modem a public IP you can access ssh directly with the IP. You will need a DDNS service like Duck DNS to point a domain name to the IP of the 3G modem as the public IP of the modem will change.

Thank you! Your name Subject Comment * Leave this field blank SMS Submitted by The Fan Club on Thu, 2014-02-27 16:52 Hi Andrew. Look at using Gammu for sending sms's, you do not need to connect to the 3G network with wvdial, just make sure the modem is in 3G mode. Your name Subject Comment * Leave this field blank Re SMS Submitted by Andrew (not verified) on Sat, 2014-03-01 01:12 Hi, thanks for replying! By putting the dongle in 3G mode I assume. Because I can get it into modem mode using usb modeswitch, like you have written, but then gammu will not work because there is nothing in the ttyUSB ports? Thanks again. Your name Subject Comment * Leave this field blank SMS Submitted by The Fan Club on Sat, 2014-03-01 10:40 Hi Andrew, this article is not about SMS. Try and replace /dev/ttyUSB device with /dev/gsmmodem. Your name Subject Comment * Leave this field blank Step #2 Submitted by Octopus (not verified) on Fri, 2014-03-07 20:49 Can you please clarify what you do in step 2. lsusb gives you two different numbers. For me I get the same numbers. What is the difference? All you do is a cold reboot vs a warm reboot? Your name Subject Comment * Leave this field blank Step #2 Submitted by The Fan Club on Fri, 2014-03-07 22:10 Hi Ocopus, it is confusing. Most modems have two modes, the USB mode and a modem mode. The modem is detected differently if plugged in on a soft reboot vs hard reboot. Try booting the Pi without the modem plugged in. Then plug it in, wait a 10 seconds and the do the lsusb. Usually this is the usb mode. Then with reboot with sudo reboot, this will make sure the modem is powered on the reboot and usb modeswitch should do the switching to modem mode. Check the numbers again now with lsusb. Your name Subject Comment * Leave this field blank Huawei E303c supported on Raspberrry Pi?

The command “fdisk -l” will list all the storage devices seen by the operating system: Here is without any devices in the uSD slot. Listed is the internal eMMC storage device (listing only relevant parts): fdisk-l-noSD After inserting a 32MB uSD card we see this additional device: fdisk-l-32MSD After inserting a 2 GB uSD card we see this device instead: fdisk-l-2GSD We realize that the any card inserted in the uSD slot is characterized by “/dev/mmcblk1p1”. “mmc” stands for “multimedia card” -both SD cards and eMMC devices conform to the “multimedia card” specification. “blk1” I think represents “block device 1” and “p1” is “partition 1” However, if the uSD card is already inserted during, we see the following: fdisk-l-beforeboot The device is assigned /dev/mmcblk0p1. It appears the the order the device numbers are assigned at boot time is uSD card first, then internal eMMC. Mounting the uSD card In order to access the contents on the uSD card, the device must be first mounted. First create a “mount point” (a folder). Here I use the directory /media which is already present. Under /media create a directory to mount the uSD card. I created /media/card, /media/usb and /media/nas to represent the 3 different places where music tracks can be stored. Use the command “mount” mount.card The “-v” flag in “mount” is optional. Means “verbose”. Notice that after mounting the uSD card, I can see the “smallmusic” directory and 1 mp3 track. Keep in mind that if the uSD card is already inserted at boot time, it is assigned “mmcblk0p1” instead of “mmcblk1p1” ACCESSING USB MEMORY STICK If digital audio is transmitted through the I2S interface, then the USB host can also be used for a USB memory device. The same procedure can be used to mount a usb memory stick: Insert a USB storage to the USB host connector Type “fdisk -l” to identify the device. Notice that it is /dev/sda1 Type mount /dev/sda1 /”mount point” in my case, mount /dev/sda1 /media/usb Inserting a USB storage device will show up as: fdiskUSB Since there is only one usb host port, a USB memory device will always appear as /dev/sda1 whether it is present during boot or not. AUTOMATING THE MOUNT PROCESS It becomes cumbersome to have to access the board through the command line in order to mount a storage device. For a music device, the ideal is to have these storage devices mounted automatically. I tried different ways to auto-mount the devices when they are inserted: Autofs: looks like the most promising but did not work in my installation while following this excellent guide [link] usbmount: works well with uSD cards and USB storage at any time after boot, but when deleting the X11 package, it wound fail to mount uSD cards. usbmount was last updated in 2007 and is currently unmaintained. Add mount instructions in /etc/fstab which is invoked only during boot time. For now the “best” option in my environment seems using /etc/fstab and ensuring the storage devices are present during boot. This seems a reasonable configuration for an audio player: Insert the storage devices and turn-on the device. Even if switching to another storage device requiring a reboot, the booting process is very short. usbmount has better functionality because it works after boot. I didn’t like the fact that it stopped working for SD cards after I removed the X11 package (which I do not need). I’ll wait for more help on autofs and then I think I’ll switch to autofs. For USB I added the following line to the /etc/fstab file. usbFstab Note the following: Add the “nofail” option. Without it the board will not be able to boot if no USB memory is present in the USB port. Ensure that the USB memory has a single partition since we are assuming it is always /dev/sda1. A newly formatted USB memory device will have a single partition For the uSD Card and assuming that the card is inserted prior to boot, I added the following line: fstab-card Insert a uSD card and a USB memory device, boot the board and they will be mounted under /media/card and /media/usb (or whatever directory you had specified in /etc/fstab.

This would mean that on each bout /etc/fstab will be read and all the disk partitions – mount points are to be mounted exactly in the same order and in the same places for the OS at the specified boot level. Maybe also the ‘df’ command, with all its switches …, will work. That’s much easy than using ‘fdisk -l’ … on my poor mind. That’s since BSD, mount, the first. I don’t remember about ‘df’. Several UNIX flavours have had changes for that last. Ciao. Salvo PS TU for all UR work, that’s really interesting from several points of view. BlgGear March 19, 2014 at 19:25 Reply Thanks for sharing. My concern is that as a music player, I would set it up totally headless. (of course in order to play a track, I would have to use the command line, but I have not thought of this part yet :-)). I did try autofs but couldn’t figure out why it would not work, so I gave up… Foundatron March 22, 2014 at 15:33 Reply Another great post! you mentioned “low noise power supplies”. Can you prove some links? Foundatron March 22, 2014 at 15:34 Reply errr….provide some links:) BlgGear March 22, 2014 at 22:14 Reply For the moment I am using a linear 5V, 1A supply that came with an old ZIP drive. A linear supply (those bigger and heavier transformer-based) are lower noise than the newer switching types. No trackbacks yet. Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

Thanks!--Wmat (talk) Linux command line basics From eLinux.org Jump to: navigation, search Linux Command Line Interface (CLI from now on) could be at first glance discouraging for the average Joe, since nowadays we are only used to Graphic Interfaces. But don’t let that get you down, using a command line shell could be not only very useful, but also kind of funny. This guide will help you make your first steps in the command shell environment. First, when could a Command Line Interface be useful for you? Remote Connection via SSH: SSH remote connection allows you to interact with UDOO without physical access to it. SSH is available only with command line interface. Using a minimal Linux Distribution without a graphical interface. Some Linux Distributions come without a Graphical User Interface in order to maximize available resources. Command line interface is your only bet in this scenario. Some power-users consider CLI the most convenient way to perform code execution and file-system operations. Even if you are not in this category, you may find that the CLI can be very fast when you get used to it. To help you get started, here are some very basic Linux commands: sudo Your first ally, this command allows users to run programs with the security privileges of root, or superuser. Its name is a concatenation of &quot;su&quot; (super user) and &quot;do&quot;, or take action . So, if you get an error message saying &quot;only root can do that&quot;, just use the same command preceded with sudo. sudo su This enables root privileges once for all, without forcing you to type sudo everytime. It works until you close the shell you are working in. sudo su touch Creates an empty file. nano Open an handy text editor. To save and exit, press CTRL and X, and press Y for yes or N for no. cat Shows the content of a file, it speeds up file inspection for smaller files. e.g. cat /etc/hostname ls Lists the contents of the current folder. cd Changes current folder to specific folder. cd.. Changes current folder to a higher folder level. cd / Changes current folder to root (top filesystem level). rm Deletes a file. rm -rf Deletes a folder. mv Moves a file or a folder. Useful for renaming as well, e.g. mv myfile /myfolder/myfile and mv myfile mysecondfile cp Copies a file, e.g. cp myfile /home/ubuntu/ cp -R Copies a folder, e.g. cp -R myfolder /home/ubuntu/myfolder mkdir Creates a folder top A very useful utility, this command basically gives you a complete overview of the system's status. It produces an ordered list of running processes selected by user-specified criteria. top shows how much processing power and memory are being used, as well as other information about the running processes. df -h Shows used and available disk space, in megabytes. ifconfig -a Shows useful networking data, like current IP, netmasks and other statistics. chmod Lets you set files permissions. This utility is very important for people concerned about security, but it is also useful for coders, since you can set a script as executable with it. dmesg Shows the messages resulting from the most recent system boot. This is useful for troubleshooting, since you can see which modules have been loaded, which binaries have started and so on. sync Thanks to this command your SD card lifespan will drastically improve, remember to launch it every time before you turn UDOO off or remove the power. It completes all pending input/output operations. It must be launched as root, or with sudo. reboot Reboots the system. shutdown Shuts it down.

Page Contents [hide] 1 The Video 2 Getting started 3 Setting up the Circuit 4 Setup for Device Tree Overlays 5 Using an Overlay 6 The C++ Code 7 Citation 8 Further Reading: The Video In this video I am going to continue my series on the Beaglebone by demonstrating how to use its GPIOs for both input and output applications. In this video I will wire simple input and output circuits that are attached to two GPIOs – one that lights an LED and the other that receives a button input. I covered this topic below before in a previous video. I am updating it here because there have been significant changes to the Linux kernel. This video will cover the Linux device tree for ARM embedded systems and explain how you can create custom device tree overlays to configure the GPIOs for your applications at run time from within the Linux userspace. I will explain the use of internal and external pullup and pulldown resistors and I will make available and describe a set of C++ code examples for reading and writing to the Beaglebone’s GPIOs. I have also built a set of PDF tables that aggregate the information that you need and make it easier to configure GPIOs on your Beaglebone’s P8 and P9 headers. The code for this video is available by typing: git clone git://github.com/derekmolloy/boneDeviceTree.git 1 git clone git://github.com/derekmolloy/boneDeviceTree.git The information below is covered in the video, but here it is just in case you need to get a text view: Getting started We can get some information about the pins in use: root@beaglebone:/sys/kernel/debug/pinctrl/44e10800.pinmux# cat

old video. Since each GPIO module provides 32 dedicated GPIOs (general purpose input/output) and the GPIOs support 4 banks of 32 GPIOs (so, 128 GPIOs in total) the naming of GPIO0_5, would be GPIO 5 as (0 x32 + 5 = 5) (Pin 12 on the P9 Header) GPIO1_28 – The LED = 1 x 32 + 28 = GPIO 60 (Offset 0x078, P9-12 GPIO1_28) #88 NOTE: GPIO 60 is not PIN 60!!! If we check pins again and search for pin 60, by using the offset we can see: root@beaglebone:/sys/kernel/debug/pinctrl/44e10800.pinmux# more pins |grep 878 pin 30 (44e10878) 00000030 pinctrl-single 1 2 root@beaglebone:/sys/kernel/debug/pinctrl/44e10800.pinmux# more pins |grep 878 pin 30 (44e10878) 00000030 pinctrl-single The pin mode on pin 30 is 30 HEX. What does that mean? Well to understand this you need the document to beat all documents – the AM3359 Technical Reference Manual. http://www.ti.com/product/am3359 and you can see the link for this document. The version I am using is called the “AM335x ARM Cortex-A8 Microprocessors (MPUs) Technical Reference Manual (Rev.H). It is a 18.5MB document with 4,727 pages (no typo there – 4,700 pages!). The current direct link is: http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/spruh73j/spruh73j.pdf The GPIOs section is Chapter 25 and begins on page 4,056. The page I am most interested in is Page 815, Section 9.3.51. You can search the PDF for “conf_&lt;module&gt;” if you are using a different version of the document. The value: 0x30 Hex is 110000 in Binary, so what does that mean? Well, you have to see the table: Bit Field Reset Description 6 conf_&lt;module&gt;_&lt;pin&gt;_slewctrl X Slew Control. Slew Rate: Fast is 0, Slow is 1 5 conf_&lt;module&gt;_&lt;pin&gt;_rxactive 1h Receiver Active. Input Enable: Receiver Disable 0, Receiver Enable 1 4 conf_&lt;module&gt;_&lt;pin&gt;_putypesel X Pad Pullup/Pulldown Type. Pulldown is 0, Pullup is 1 3 conf_&lt;module&gt;_&lt;pin&gt;_puden X Pad Pullup/Pulldown enable. Enabled is 0, Disabled is 1 2-0 conf_&lt;module&gt;_&lt;pin&gt;_mmode X Mode. Pad functional mux select. A number between 0 and 7 i.e. 000 and 111. This depends on which mode we require. Well if you look at this table, you see that 0x30 means the slew rate is fast, the receiver is enabled, the pad is set for pullup and pullup is enabled. The Mode is 0. which means when you look a the table for this pin on the P9 header (Table 8. Expansion Header P9 Pinout), you see that pin is set as: Beaglebone P9 Header, Pin 12, Mode 0 is gpmc_be1n, we would like to set it to Mode 7, which is gpio1[28] (Note the LED is currently on). 27 means 100111 = Fast, Enable Receiver, Pulldown type, enabled, mux mode 7. 37 means 110111 = Fast, Enable Receiver, Pullup type, enabled, mux mode 7. Be careful, not all pins work in this way and there are external resistors on the board that affect the behaviour. For example, pins GPIO2_6 to GPIO2_14 all have external 42.2k resistors to GND and 100k resistors to high. We can export the pins by echoing the GPIO number to /sys/class/gpio/export root@beaglebone:/sys/class/gpio# ls -al total 0 drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 0 Jan 1 2000 . drwxr-xr-x 48 root root 0 Jan 1 2000 .. --w------- 1 root root 4096 Jun 1 22:21 export lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 1 2000 gpiochip0 -&gt; ../../devices/virtual/gpio/gpiochip0 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 1 2000 gpiochip32 -&gt; ../../devices/virtual/gpio/gpiochip32 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 1 2000 gpiochip64 -&gt; ../../devices/virtual/gpio/gpiochip64 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 1 2000 gpiochip96 -&gt; ../../devices/virtual/gpio/gpiochip96 --w------- 1 root root 4096 Jan 1 2000 unexport root@beaglebone:/sys/class/gpio# echo 117 &gt; export root@beaglebone:/sys/class/gpio# echo 60 &gt; export root@beaglebone:/sys/class/gpio# ls -al total 0 drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 0 Jan 1 2000 . drwxr-xr-x 48 root root 0 Jan 1 2000 .. --w------- 1 root root 4096 Jun 1 22:22 export lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jun 1 22:22 gpio117 -&gt; ../../devices/virtual/gpio/gpio117 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jun 1 22:22 gpio60 -&gt; ../../devices/virtual/gpio/gpio60 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 1 2000 gpiochip0 -&gt; ../../devices/virtual/gpio/gpiochip0 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 1 2000 gpiochip32 -&gt; ../../devices/virtual/gpio/gpiochip32 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 1 2000 gpiochip64 -&gt; ../../devices/virtual/gpio/gpiochip64 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 1 2000 gpiochip96 -&gt; ../../devices/virtual/gpio/gpiochip96 --w------- 1 root root 4096 Jan 1 2000 unexport root@beaglebone:/sys/class/gpio# cd gpio60 root@beaglebone:/sys/class/gpio/gpio60# ls -al total 0 drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 0 Jun 1 22:22 . drwxr-xr-x 8 root root 0 Jan 1 2000 .. -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Jun 1 22:24 active_low -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Jun 1 22:24 direction -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Jun 1 22:24 edge drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 0 Jun 1 22:24 power lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jun 1 22:24 subsystem -&gt; ../../../../class/gpio -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Jun 1 22:22 uevent -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Jun 1 22:24 value root@beaglebone:/sys/class/gpio/gpio60# echo &quot;out&quot; &gt; direction root@beaglebone:/sys/class/gpio/gpio60# cat direction out root@beaglebone:/sys/class/gpio/gpio60# echo 0 &gt; value root@beaglebone:/sys/class/gpio/gpio60# echo 1 &gt; value root@beaglebone:/sys/class/gpio/gpio60# echo 0 &gt; value root@beaglebone:/sys/class/gpio/gpio60# echo 1 &gt; value 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 root@beaglebone:/sys/class/gpio# ls -al total 0 drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 0 Jan 1 2000 . drwxr-xr-x 48 root root 0 Jan 1 2000 .. --w------- 1 root root 4096 Jun 1 22:21 export lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 1 2000 gpiochip0 -&gt; ../../devices/virtual/gpio/gpiochip0 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 1 2000 gpiochip32 -&gt; ../../devices/virtual/gpio/gpiochip32 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 1 2000 gpiochip64 -&gt; ../../devices/virtual/gpio/gpiochip64 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 1 2000 gpiochip96 -&gt; ../../devices/virtual/gpio/gpiochip96 --w------- 1 root root 4096 Jan 1 2000 unexport root@beaglebone:/sys/class/gpio# echo 117 &gt; export root@beaglebone:/sys/class/gpio# echo 60 &gt; export root@beaglebone:/sys/class/gpio# ls -al total 0 drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 0 Jan 1 2000 . drwxr-xr-x 48 root root 0 Jan 1 2000 .. --w------- 1 root root 4096 Jun 1 22:22 export lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jun 1 22:22 gpio117 -&gt; ../../devices/virtual/gpio/gpio117 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jun 1 22:22 gpio60 -&gt; ../../devices/virtual/gpio/gpio60 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 1 2000 gpiochip0 -&gt; ../../devices/virtual/gpio/gpiochip0 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 1 2000 gpiochip32 -&gt; ../../devices/virtual/gpio/gpiochip32 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 1 2000 gpiochip64 -&gt; ../../devices/virtual/gpio/gpiochip64 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 1 2000 gpiochip96 -&gt; ../../devices/virtual/gpio/gpiochip96 --w------- 1 root root 4096 Jan 1 2000 unexport root@beaglebone:/sys/class/gpio# cd gpio60 root@beaglebone:/sys/class/gpio/gpio60# ls -al total 0 drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 0 Jun 1 22:22 . drwxr-xr-x 8 root root 0 Jan 1 2000 .. -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Jun 1 22:24 active_low -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Jun 1 22:24 direction -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Jun 1 22:24 edge drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 0 Jun 1 22:24 power lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jun 1 22:24 subsystem -&gt; ../../../../class/gpio -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Jun 1 22:22 uevent -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Jun 1 22:24 value root@beaglebone:/sys/class/gpio/gpio60# echo &quot;out&quot; &gt; direction root@beaglebone:/sys/class/gpio/gpio60# cat direction out root@beaglebone:/sys/class/gpio/gpio60# echo 0 &gt; value root@beaglebone:/sys/class/gpio/gpio60# echo 1 &gt; value root@beaglebone:/sys/class/gpio/gpio60# echo 0 &gt; value root@beaglebone:/sys/class/gpio/gpio60# echo 1 &gt; value Light goes on and off. The Beaglebone Black System Reference Manual (SRM) is available at: http://circuitco.com/support/index.php?title=BeagleBoneBlack Page 65 of the SRM has the table that you need to map the GPIO to the Offset! GPIO1_28 maps to P9-12 with an offset of 160 (pin 88 44e10960) Setup for Device Tree Overlays https://github.com/jadonk/validation-scripts/blob/master/test-capemgr/README.md As is described in this guide: root@beaglebone:/lib/firmware# export SLOTS=/sys/devices/bone_capemgr.9/slots root@beaglebone:/lib/firmware# export PINS=/sys/kernel/debug/pinctrl/44e10800.pinmux/pins 1 2 root@beaglebone:/lib/firmware# export SLOTS=/sys/devices/bone_capemgr.9/slots root@beaglebone:/lib/firmware# export PINS=/sys/kernel/debug/pinctrl/44e10800.pinmux/pins We now have $SLOTS and $PINS that we can echo root@beaglebone:/lib/firmware# echo $SLOTS /sys/devices/bone_capemgr.9/slots root@beaglebone:/lib/firmware# echo $PINS /sys/kernel/debug/pinctrl/44e10800.pinmux/pins 1 2 3 4 root@beaglebone:/lib/firmware# echo $SLOTS /sys/devices/bone_capemgr.9/slots root@beaglebone:/lib/firmware# echo $PINS /sys/kernel/debug/pinctrl/44e10800.pinmux/pins But we can also cat these values, for example cat $SLOTS: root@beaglebone:~/temp# cat $SLOTS 0: 54:PF--- 1: 55:PF--- 2: 56:PF--- 3: 57:PF--- 4: ff:P-O-L Bone-LT-eMMC-2G,00A0,Texas Instrument,BB-BONE-EMMC-2G 5: ff:P-O-L Bone-Black-HDMI,00A0,Texas Instrument,BB-BONELT-HDMI 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 root@beaglebone:~/temp# cat $SLOTS 0: 54:PF--- 1: 55:PF--- 2: 56:PF--- 3: 57:PF--- 4: ff:P-O-L Bone-LT-eMMC-2G,00A0,Texas Instrument,BB-BONE-EMMC-2G 5: ff:P-O-L Bone-Black-HDMI,00A0,Texas Instrument,BB-BONELT-HDMI Just so that I always have these environment variables I am adding them to my .profile. So my ~/.profile looks like this: export SLOTS=/sys/devices/bone_capemgr.9/slots export PINS=/sys/kernel/debug/pinctrl/44e10800.pinmux/pins export CURL_CA_BUNDLE=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt 1 2 3 export SLOTS=/sys/devices/bone_capemgr.9/slots export PINS=/sys/kernel/debug/pinctrl/44e10800.pinmux/pins export CURL_CA_BUNDLE=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt Which includes the environment variable to set up the certs to fix the configuration issue for curl as discussed here: Git and Curl SSL Certificates Configuration on Beaglebone Black If we wish to set these values now, without typing them twice we can use the ‘.’ so: root@beaglebone:~# . ~/.profile root@beaglebone:~# echo $CURL_CA_BUNDLE /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt 1 2 3 root@beaglebone:~# . ~/.profile root@beaglebone:~# echo $CURL_CA_BUNDLE /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt And you can see that the variables have been set. Using an Overlay Overlays allow the initial device tree that was described at boot to be modified in userspace at run time. This is useful as we are able to enable any device without having to recompile the kernel and/or reboot. When you enable output using the pinmux settings, you’re only enabling the output driver circuitry at the pin. When you change the mux, you’re selecting which internal signal gets connected to this pins output driver. So, the pin mux (physical pin) is completely separate from the gpio block (internal signal). You have to enable both. In this overlay example I am using the bone-pinmux-helper to enable the pins. The GPIO is treated as a separate peripheral, just like all other peripherals. root@beaglebone:~/boneDeviceTree/overlay# ls -al total 16 drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jun 6 23:59 . drwxr-xr-x 6 root root 4096 Jan 1 2000 .. -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1129 Jun 6 23:56 DM-GPIO-Test.dts -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 124 Jun 6 23:29 build root@beaglebone:~/boneDeviceTree/overlay# more ./build #!/bin/bash echo &quot;Compiling the overlay from .dts to .dtbo&quot; dtc -O dtb -o DM-GPIO-Test-00A0.dtbo -b 0 -@ DM-GPIO-Test.dts root@beaglebone:~/boneDeviceTree/overlay# ./build Compiling the overlay from .dts to .dtbo root@beaglebone:~/boneDeviceTree/overlay# ls -al total 20 drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jun 6 23:59 . drwxr-xr-x 6 root root 4096 Jan 1 2000 .. -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 952 Jun 6 23:59 DM-GPIO-Test-00A0.dtbo -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1129 Jun 6 23:56 DM-GPIO-Test.dts -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 124 Jun 6 23:29 build root@beaglebone:~/boneDeviceTree/overlay# cp DM-GPIO-Test-00A0.dtbo /lib/firmware 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 root@beaglebone:~/boneDeviceTree/overlay# ls -al total 16 drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jun 6 23:59 . drwxr-xr-x 6 root root 4096 Jan 1 2000 .. -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1129 Jun 6 23:56 DM-GPIO-Test.dts -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 124 Jun 6 23:29 build root@beaglebone:~/boneDeviceTree/overlay# more ./build #!/bin/bash echo &quot;Compiling the overlay from .dts to .dtbo&quot; dtc -O dtb -o DM-GPIO-Test-00A0.dtbo -b 0 -@ DM-GPIO-Test.dts root@beaglebone:~/boneDeviceTree/overlay# ./build Compiling the overlay from .dts to .dtbo root@beaglebone:~/boneDeviceTree/overlay# ls -al total 20 drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jun 6 23:59 . drwxr-xr-x 6 root root 4096 Jan 1 2000 .. -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 952 Jun 6 23:59 DM-GPIO-Test-00A0.dtbo -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1129 Jun 6 23:56 DM-GPIO-Test.dts -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 124 Jun 6 23:29 build root@beaglebone:~/boneDeviceTree/overlay# cp DM-GPIO-Test-00A0.dtbo /lib/firmware Now, note when you echo DM-GPIO-Test &gt; $SLOTS, make sure that you don’t pass DM-GPIO-Test-00A0.dtbo root@beaglebone:~# cd /lib/firmware/ root@beaglebone:/lib/firmware# cat $SLOTS 0: 54:PF--- 1: 55:PF--- 2: 56:PF--- 3: 57:PF--- 4: ff:P-O-L Bone-LT-eMMC-2G,00A0,Texas Instrument,BB-BONE-EMMC-2G 5: ff:P-O-L Bone-Black-HDMI,00A0,Texas Instrument,BB-BONELT-HDMI root@beaglebone:/lib/firmware# echo DM-GPIO-Test &gt; $SLOTS root@beaglebone:/lib/firmware# cat $SLOTS 0: 54:PF--- 1: 55:PF--- 2: 56:PF--- 3: 57:PF--- 4: ff:P-O-L Bone-LT-eMMC-2G,00A0,Texas Instrument,BB-BONE-EMMC-2G 5: ff:P-O-L Bone-Black-HDMI,00A0,Texas Instrument,BB-BONELT-HDMI 6: ff:P-O-L Override Board Name,00A0,Override Manuf,DM-GPIO-Test root@beaglebone:/lib/firmware# 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 root@beaglebone:~# cd /lib/firmware/ root@beaglebone:/lib/firmware# cat $SLOTS 0: 54:PF--- 1: 55:PF--- 2: 56:PF--- 3: 57:PF--- 4: ff:P-O-L Bone-LT-eMMC-2G,00A0,Texas Instrument,BB-BONE-EMMC-2G 5: ff:P-O-L Bone-Black-HDMI,00A0,Texas Instrument,BB-BONELT-HDMI root@beaglebone:/lib/firmware# echo DM-GPIO-Test &gt; $SLOTS root@beaglebone:/lib/firmware# cat $SLOTS 0: 54:PF--- 1: 55:PF--- 2: 56:PF--- 3: 57:PF--- 4: ff:P-O-L Bone-LT-eMMC-2G,00A0,Texas Instrument,BB-BONE-EMMC-2G 5: ff:P-O-L Bone-Black-HDMI,00A0,Texas Instrument,BB-BONELT-HDMI 6: ff:P-O-L Override Board Name,00A0,Override Manuf,DM-GPIO-Test root@beaglebone:/lib/firmware# Checking the pins (for example, pins 88 and 85): root@beaglebone:/lib/firmware# cat $PINS |grep 960 pin 88 (44e10960) 00000007 pinctrl-single root@beaglebone:/lib/firmware# cat $PINS |grep 954 pin 85 (44e10954) 00000027 pinctrl-single root@beaglebone:/lib/firmware# 1 2 3 4 5 root@beaglebone:/lib/firmware# cat $PINS |grep 960 pin 88 (44e10960) 00000007 pinctrl-single root@beaglebone:/lib/firmware# cat $PINS |grep 954 pin 85 (44e10954) 00000027 pinctrl-single root@beaglebone:/lib/firmware# 1020 is a20 – remember that it is in hexadecimal.

When I put more than 10 Khz the over load in the processor goes to 90%. I tried to use the GPIO-Keys driver and the Device Tree configuration to try not overload the processor, but seams that the GPIO-keys driver only work with interruptions less than 1Khz.

This is at address 44e10878 and offset 0x078 according to my table. A few values in the SRM did not work for me and this may have been one of them.

Thanks Karsten Sorensen July 22, 2013 at 1:57 pm - Reply Thank you for the video, and the other videos. Now the DM-GPIO-Test works. The primary problem is that the “main-line” Device Tree Compiler does not handle overlays, or at least the -@ option and you have to either patch the source of the DTC or find a version that has been properly patched. Before hitting you head against the wall type ‘dtc -h’ and look for ‘-@’ as one of the permitted options. If there is no ‘-@’ option listed, the dtc will not work and will complain that input cannot be parsed and ‘@’ is an invalid option. Tried downloading a version of dtc from RobertCNelson’s github repository. At work, it would not download because of proxy/firewall. When I tried it at home, without any proxy, it worked just fine.

I have an LCD7 cape which when connected to the beaglebone loads the correct firmware into SLOT-0. I have swapped the LCD screen to one with a different resolution, so i have modified the BB-BONE-LCD7-01-00A3.dts firmware and recompilied this using the “dtc -O dtb -o BB-BONE-LCD7-01_00A3.dtbo -b 0 -@ BB-BONE-LCD7-01-00A3.dts” code provided by Derek.

I also watched the video and that was great as well. I really appreciate it when someone goes through the effort of sharing knowledge in a well thought out and thorough way. I’m hoping that you or someone can help me with my issue. I’m trying to make the BBB communicate with an RS-485 device using UART1 or UART4 through a breakout board that uses a max3485 transceiver. The issue that I have is that this unit requires RTS. All of the RTS pins are dedicated to other functions as your table clearly shows. I’ve made a custom overlay that I think would work, except the RTS and CTS pins conflict with either the I2C2 pins on UART1 or the HDMI pins on UART4. How do I disable the I2C2 control of the P9_19 and P9_20 pins or the HDMI control of the P8_33 and P8_35 pins? Do the following overlay changes look correct for UART1-RTS? part-number = “BB-UART1-RTS”; exclusive-use = “P9.26”, “P9.24”, “P9.20”, “P9.19”, “uart1”; pinctrl-single,pins = ; (Everything else is the same as the original BB-UART1.dts file) Thank you, Tim Tim January 7, 2014 at 3:19 am - Reply The previous post deleted the following snippet from the dts file snippet. pinctrl-single,pins = ; Tim January 7, 2014 at 3:20 am - Reply 0x180 0x20 /* P9_26 = UART1_RXD, MODE0 */ 0x184 0x00 /* P9_24 = UART1_TXD, MODE0 */ 0x178 0x20 /* P9_20 = UART1_CTSN, MODE0 */ 0x17c 0x00 /* P9_19 = UART1_RTSN, MODE0 */ Tim January 11, 2014 at 5:56 pm - Reply I found a friend with an oscilloscope and we were able to find out part of the problem. We needed to connect TX-O on the 485 board to uart4_rx and RX-I on the 485 board to uart4_tx. You also need to disable the hdmi interface. Then the overlay found here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/beagleboard/6am1GKyo60s will sort of work. The remaining issues are: 1. The 485 board needs RTS to be low in order transmit and needs RTS to be low in order to receive. The uart4_rts pin is working opposite of this. Or perhaps I should say the 485 board is expecting the opposite signal from what the pin is giving it. How can I reverse the default polarity of the uart4_rts pin so it is low for transmit and high for receive? 2. I’m using pyserial and when I setup the serial port in pyserial: ser = serial.Serial(port = “/dev/ttyO4”, baudrate=9600, rtscts=True) it actually disables the RTS pin. Or at least it stops working in automatic mode. How I use pyserial with RTS?

Can you ping 8.8.8.8? If so you have IP access and it is a nameserver problem. Can you ping http://www.google.com? If so, then I am at a loss. Is github blocked from your location?

You have a wonderful flowing style with a fine balance of detail vs. getting on with the big picture. Question: I appreciate the pedagogical value of writing text to Linux files to accomplish I/O. But as an inveterate real-time graphics programmer I cringe at the inefficiency of this approach. Is there some reason I can’t write directly to the BBB GPIO pin addresses once I take them away from the kernel with EXPORT? Derek May 4, 2014 at 2:02 pm - Reply Thanks russ. Yes for real-time programming this structure is not ideal. It is possible to flush the stream to avoid opening and closing each time, but if you need real-time performance then you will have to look at the PRUs. The real advantage of embedded Linux is the software support that it provides, but it is limited for real-time programming.

Jeremiah July 30, 2014 at 2:57 am - Reply This is so needlessly complex it literally gave me a migraine trying to understand it. This is such typical Linux nonsense. One might say “but look at all the power you have,” to which I would reply “look at all the nonsense you have to fiddle with to write a ONE OR A ZERO out of a GPIO pin.” It would be faster for me to buy a parallel port, install Windows XP, and write an application in assembler to bit-bang what I want out of the parallel port than it would to bother to comprehend this device tree nonsense. It is no wonder people use Windows. … someone get me some morphine. this hurts my head. Jules October 20, 2015 at 3:55 pm - Reply I completely agree – overly complicated because no one wants to pull their head from the trough of low level geek fodder and see the larger goal – I/O configuration. I really don’t care what a device tree overlay is and whether or not I have to use one to configure my pins. I simply want to configure my I/O to accommodate the circuit. And here’s the best part. I’ve been thinking I’ll circumvent this pile of horse manure by creating a cape with an EEPROM that defines all the pin configurations. That’s great, plug in the hardware and auto-configure your I/O. But NO, you still need a DTO in addition to this which, for the life of me, I can’t see why. Note: For anyone reading this, please do not respond to explain why – I’m not interested in how bad designs work, only good ones. mbjvfx August 12, 2014 at 4:11 pm - Reply When you said: “If we check pins again and search for pin 60, by using the offset we can see:” Did you mean: “If we check pins again and search for pin 30 (GPIO 60), by using the offset (0x078) we can see:” John Holeman September 18, 2014 at 7:04 pm - Reply Not sure if this was mentioned before, but the link to the Linux kernel GPIO docs is stale.

This is at address 44e10878 and offset 0×078 according to my table. A few values in the SRM did not work for me and this may have been one of them. Hence, I generated the table directly from the board itself. Let me know if you get it working against my values, Derek.” I’m having trouble generating the GPIO mapping table from the board. The offsets in the SRM don’t work. Can you please let me know how you generate the mapping table from the board itself? That would be useful insight for me. Thank you in advance! Regards, Ashok R. Kaubha September 22, 2014 at 12:45 pm - Reply Hi Derek and friends, Thanks for all discussion here. I am a new to linux world and followed every step as shown in the video. Good part is I could see change in mode for pins shown in video. Now I want to change modes of lcd_data pins i.e. P8_31 to P8_46 as GPIO. When I insert addresses like 0x0a0, 0x0a4 etc in .dts file, I do not see any relevant changes in modes of these files when seen on $PINS | more. Point to note is I followed same procedure again by deleting previous files. Also, mode changes are seen correct when pin addresses are changed to those demonstrated in video. Is there any restriction in using lcd_data pins as GPIO (I am not using HDMI port)? or is there any other way to put Hex numbers as addresses? My code in fragment 0 looks like this: fragment@0 { target = ; __overlay__ { pinctrl_test: DM_GPIO_Test_Pins { pinctrl-single,pins = ; code doesn’t work. But when i revert back to below code, everything works well. fragment@0 { target = ; __overlay__ { pinctrl_test: DM_GPIO_Test_Pins { pinctrl-single,pins = ; Can anyone comment on this?

Question: Can I be using both Mode 0 (for the SPI pins) and Mode 7 for a GPIO interrupt on another pin at the same time (the same Python program running)?

If I make an overlay following your example for a single pin, with a setting of 0x27 (input with pull-down enable), it works right after boot. Same for pull-up (0x37). But if I try to unload the overlay (echo ‘-overlay_number’ &gt;$SLOTS) and load one with the opposite pull setting it doesn’t seem to take: I still get high if it was initially configured with pull-up, or low if initially configured with pull-down. Is there anything in the overlay example itself that might be causing this, or is it just a bug somewhere?

Ken October 28, 2014 at 8:01 pm - Reply Am I correct in assuming that all of the IO performed using the techniques explained here are using ‘polled’ techniques ‘behind-the-scenes’? Or is the kernel using interrupt service routines to drive IO? Rick Mann December 25, 2014 at 12:22 pm - Reply Hi Derek, thank you very much for these tutorials, and the book (which I just bought, hoping it would help with my issue). No matter what I do, I can’t get the GPIO inputs value to reflect the actual state of the pin. I tried one output and I couldn’t get the pin’s voltage to change despite changing the value. I’m running Debian 7/3.8.13-bone68. Everything I can think to check matches what you have on this page and in the book. Even pins that are configured by default as input with pullup enabled report a value 0 (but checking with the DMM, the pin is near 3.3 V). I’ve tried pins on both headers. FWIW, I’ve been able to use the ADC for some time. Any idea on what I can check? Thank you! Rick Mann December 26, 2014 at 12:39 am - Reply Ah, I figured it out. I misunderstood all the admonitions that “GPIO number” wasn’t the same as “pin number.” I thought “GPIO Number” was some TI reference, and “pin number” was how Linux referred to the pin. But in fact, Linux (in its infinite wisdom) uses two different labels for a pin, depending on what part of sysfs you’re using. Awesome. Just awesome. To be clear: The “pin number” (e.g. 36 for P8_07) is what’s used in /sys/kernel/debug/pinctrl/44e10800.pinmux/pins. The “GPIO number” is what’s used in /sys/class/gpio/… (e.g. 66 for P8_07). Derek December 26, 2014 at 11:26 pm - Reply Hi Rick, Yes, that issue has caught many people out (including me on my first pass!). I have listed the software reference as $PINS on the P8/P9 header tables. The book should help! — there is a big warning that makes that clear in Chapter 6 :-). Thanks for your support, Derek. Dave December 30, 2015 at 9:08 pm - Reply Hi everybody, Thank to your explanation is now clear to me too. But there is another problem in this site, which I cannot understand and I think it is a typo made by Mr. Molloy. I refer to the fact, that at the very beginning of the page the used gpio is the following one: Pin 12 on the P9 Header) GPIO1_28 – The LED = 1 x 32 + 28 = GPIO 60 (Offset 0x078, P9-12 GPIO1_28) #88 Mr. Molloy calculates the GPIO corresponding pin and then writes the offset for that port. That’s ok, but lately in this page he wrote: Page 65 of the SRM has the table that you need to map the GPIO to the Offset! GPIO1_28 maps to P9-12 with an offset of 160 (pin 88 44e10960) Despite of the fact that I couldn’t find any help at that page (but I found the checklist on page 104 of the SRM very helplful), the real problem is that I cannot understand why the GPIO1_28 has now 2 different offsets. The former is 0x078 and latter is 160 (0x0A0 in HEX). Which is the real offset of that pin? Is a mistake in this website or there is another explanation? Anyway this tutorial is really helpful and very interesting to understand the beaglebone. Regards and happy new year. Daniel January 12, 2015 at 11:25 am - Reply Hello Derek, Thaks for the tutorial. After following it I was able to change the state of GPIO pins in userspace by exporting them. However I am writing a kernel module to write values to the GPIO pins however that does not work. My approach was to follow your procedure to configure the mux to set the corresponding pins to GPIO output. Then set the bits within my kernel module using GPIO registers siva February 17, 2015 at 6:54 am - Reply Hi Derek I am using custom board based on AM335x and sdk-7 not beagle bone black board, we are not using HDMI controller and we direct interface leds to lcd_data0* to lcd_data7* pins(GPIO2_6,7,8,9,10,11,12) we took reference as bbb user leds. 1.

Apologies if this is redundant post, but it seems the DTO mechanism for updating the device trees at runtime has been removed from recent kernels (greater than 3.8 I believe). In particular, the /sys/devices/bone_capemgr.9 file is gone. They are apparently working on something new but in the mean time do you have any suggestions? Should I revert back to the “onerous” mechanism of editing DTS directly and recompiling? Thanks for any help, – Steve Dave D June 23, 2015 at 12:28 pm - Reply Hi Derek. Great info, love all your videos and your book. I’ve got this to work as the root user, but how do you get it to work as a non-root user? For instance, the user “debian”. It does not have write access to the /sys/class/gpio directory. I wrote some hack code to get around this using the system() command and sudo, but there must be a proper way.

Gaurav Roy June 9, 2016 at 5:14 am - Reply Hi derek, Thank you so much for these tutorials. They are a life saver. I dont know if this post is related to this topic or not but I am having some trouble connecting a flight controller to the BBB. I am trying to connect the KK Mini flight controller which takes in 4 PWM signals at 5 volts. I need to basically output 4 PWMs from the BBB at 3.3 V to the flight controller at 5 V. I have used a logic converter circuit using 4 N MOSFETs. The trouble is that these have damaged one BBB and I dont want to repeat that again. I think the problem is when the BBB is switched off these four wires going to the logic converter circuit are at 3.3V by default and this voltage going back to the BBB is destroying the board as it is mentioned in multiple places in the SRM that we should never give any voltage to the GPIO pins when the BBB is powered down. How do you suggest that I connect these circuits so that they are always powered on after the BBB finishes booting up and powered down before it switches off. http://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/image/data/tutorial/mosfet_level_converter.jpg This is the circuit that I have implemented. The low side is connected to the BBB and the high side is connected to inputs on the flight controller. Another thing I have tried is to give the +3.3V source from one of the GPIO(P9_23) instead of the 3V3 rail on the BBB so that I can control switching on and off the low side before the signal wires go high or low but this doesn’t seem to work as it doesn’t change the output signal when I change the input signal. But when I connect the voltage source to 3V3 it works. Could you suggest me a better option that I can use universally wherever I need to convert 3.3V to 5V for my signals(including the PWM). Also I have discussed this question in further detail on stackexchange. http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/239803/connecting-the-beaglebone-black-to-the-kk-mini-flight-controller/239807?noredirect=1#comment523325_239807 Please consider giving me some advice.

Here, we’ll review a few basic tools for undoing changes that you’ve made. Be careful, because you can’t always undo some of these undos. This is one of the few areas in Git where you may lose some work if you do it wrong. One of the common undos takes place when you commit too early and possibly forget to add some files, or you mess up your commit message. If you want to try that commit again, you can run commit with the --amend option: $ git commit --amend This command takes your staging area and uses it for the commit. If you’ve made no changes since your last commit (for instance, you run this command immediately after your previous commit), then your snapshot will look exactly the same, and all you’ll change is your commit message. The same commit-message editor fires up, but it already contains the message of your previous commit. You can edit the message the same as always, but it overwrites your previous commit. As an example, if you commit and then realize you forgot to stage the changes in a file you wanted to add to this commit, you can do something like this: $ git commit -m 'initial commit' $ git add forgotten_file $ git commit --amend You end up with a single commit – the second commit replaces the results of the first. Unstaging a Staged File The next two sections demonstrate how to wrangle your staging area and working directory changes. The nice part is that the command you use to determine the state of those two areas also reminds you how to undo changes to them. For example, let’s say you’ve changed two files and want to commit them as two separate changes, but you accidentally type git add * and stage them both. How can you unstage one of the two? The git status command reminds you: $ git add * $ git status On branch master Changes to be committed: (use &quot;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage) renamed: README.md -&gt; README modified: CONTRIBUTING.md Right below the “Changes to be committed” text, it says use git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;... to unstage. So, let’s use that advice to unstage the CONTRIBUTING.md file: $ git reset HEAD CONTRIBUTING.md Unstaged changes after reset: M CONTRIBUTING.md $ git status On branch master Changes to be committed: (use &quot;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage) renamed: README.md -&gt; README Changes not staged for commit: (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed) (use &quot;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory) modified: CONTRIBUTING.md The command is a bit strange, but it works. The CONTRIBUTING.md file is modified but once again unstaged. Note While git reset can be a dangerous command if you call it with --hard, in this instance the file in your working directory is not touched. Calling git reset without an option is not dangerous - it only touches your staging area. For now this magic invocation is all you need to know about the git reset command. We’ll go into much more detail about what reset does and how to master it to do really interesting things in Reset Demystified. Unmodifying a Modified File What if you realize that you don’t want to keep your changes to the CONTRIBUTING.md file? How can you easily unmodify it – revert it back to what it looked like when you last committed (or initially cloned, or however you got it into your working directory)? Luckily, git status tells you how to do that, too. In the last example output, the unstaged area looks like this: Changes not staged for commit: (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed) (use &quot;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory) modified: CONTRIBUTING.md It tells you pretty explicitly how to discard the changes you’ve made. Let’s do what it says: $ git checkout -- CONTRIBUTING.md $ git status On branch master Changes to be committed: (use &quot;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage) renamed: README.md -&gt; README You can see that the changes have been reverted. Important It’s important to understand that git checkout -- &lt;file&gt; is a dangerous command. Any changes you made to that file are gone – Git just copied another file over it. Don’t ever use this command unless you absolutely know that you don’t want the file. If you would like to keep the changes you’ve made to that file but still need to get it out of the way for now, we’ll go over stashing and branching in Git Branching; these are generally better ways to go. Remember, anything that is committed in Git can almost always be recovered. Even commits that were on branches that were deleted or commits that were overwritten with an --amend commit can be recovered (see Data Recovery for data recovery). However, anything you lose that was never committed is likely never to be seen again. prev | next This open sourced site is hosted on GitHub. Patches, suggestions and comments are welcome.

Internet Protocols and Support » 20.7. httplib — HTTP protocol client¶ Note The httplib module has been renamed to http.client in Python 3. The 2to3 tool will automatically adapt imports when converting your sources to Python 3. Source code: Lib/httplib.py This module defines classes which implement the client side of the HTTP and HTTPS protocols. It is normally not used directly — the module urllib uses it to handle URLs that use HTTP and HTTPS. See also The Requests package is recommended for a higher-level HTTP client interface. Note HTTPS support is only available if the socket module was compiled with SSL support. Note The public interface for this module changed substantially in Python 2.0. The HTTP class is retained only for backward compatibility with 1.5.2. It should not be used in new code. Refer to the online docstrings for usage. The module provides the following classes: class httplib.HTTPConnection(host[, port[, strict[, timeout[, source_address]]]])¶ An HTTPConnection instance represents one transaction with an HTTP server. It should be instantiated passing it a host and optional port number. If no port number is passed, the port is extracted from the host string if it has the form host:port, else the default HTTP port (80) is used. When True, the optional parameter strict (which defaults to a false value) causes BadStatusLine to be raised if the status line can’t be parsed as a valid HTTP/1.0 or 1.1 status line. If the optional timeout parameter is given, blocking operations (like connection attempts) will timeout after that many seconds (if it is not given, the global default timeout setting is used). The optional source_address parameter may be a tuple of a (host, port) to use as the source address the HTTP connection is made from. For example, the following calls all create instances that connect to the server at the same host and port: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; h1 = httplib.HTTPConnection('www.cwi.nl') &gt;&gt;&gt; h2 = httplib.HTTPConnection('www.cwi.nl:80') &gt;&gt;&gt; h3 = httplib.HTTPConnection('www.cwi.nl', 80) &gt;&gt;&gt; h3 = httplib.HTTPConnection('www.cwi.nl', 80, timeout=10) New in version 2.0. Changed in version 2.6: timeout was added. Changed in version 2.7: source_address was added. class httplib.HTTPSConnection(host[, port[, key_file[, cert_file[, strict[, timeout[, source_address[, context]]]]]]])¶ A subclass of HTTPConnection that uses SSL for communication with secure servers. Default port is 443. If context is specified, it must be a ssl.SSLContext instance describing the various SSL options. key_file and cert_file are deprecated, please use ssl.SSLContext.load_cert_chain() instead, or let ssl.create_default_context() select the system’s trusted CA certificates for you. Please read Security considerations for more information on best practices. New in version 2.0. Changed in version 2.6: timeout was added. Changed in version 2.7: source_address was added. Changed in version 2.7.9: context was added. This class now performs all the necessary certificate and hostname checks by default. To revert to the previous, unverified, behavior ssl._create_unverified_context() can be passed to the context parameter. class httplib.HTTPResponse(sock, debuglevel=0, strict=0)¶ Class whose instances are returned upon successful connection. Not instantiated directly by user. New in version 2.0. class httplib.HTTPMessage¶ An HTTPMessage instance is used to hold the headers from an HTTP response. It is implemented using the mimetools.Message class and provides utility functions to deal with HTTP Headers. It is not directly instantiated by the users. The following exceptions are raised as appropriate: exception httplib.HTTPException¶ The base class of the other exceptions in this module. It is a subclass of Exception. New in version 2.0. exception httplib.NotConnected¶ A subclass of HTTPException. New in version 2.0. exception httplib.InvalidURL¶ A subclass of HTTPException, raised if a port is given and is either non-numeric or empty. New in version 2.3. exception httplib.UnknownProtocol¶ A subclass of HTTPException. New in version 2.0. exception httplib.UnknownTransferEncoding¶ A subclass of HTTPException. New in version 2.0. exception httplib.UnimplementedFileMode¶ A subclass of HTTPException. New in version 2.0. exception httplib.IncompleteRead¶ A subclass of HTTPException. New in version 2.0. exception httplib.ImproperConnectionState¶ A subclass of HTTPException. New in version 2.0. exception httplib.CannotSendRequest¶ A subclass of ImproperConnectionState. New in version 2.0. exception httplib.CannotSendHeader¶ A subclass of ImproperConnectionState. New in version 2.0. exception httplib.ResponseNotReady¶ A subclass of ImproperConnectionState. New in version 2.0. exception httplib.BadStatusLine¶ A subclass of HTTPException. Raised if a server responds with a HTTP status code that we don’t understand. New in version 2.0. The constants defined in this module are: httplib.HTTP_PORT¶ The default port for the HTTP protocol (always 80). httplib.HTTPS_PORT¶ The default port for the HTTPS protocol (always 443). and also the following constants for integer status codes: Constant Value Definition CONTINUE 100 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.1.1 SWITCHING_PROTOCOLS 101 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.1.2 PROCESSING 102 WEBDAV, RFC 2518, Section 10.1 OK 200 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.2.1 CREATED 201 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.2.2 ACCEPTED 202 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.2.3 NON_AUTHORITATIVE_INFORMATION 203 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.2.4 NO_CONTENT 204 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.2.5 RESET_CONTENT 205 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.2.6 PARTIAL_CONTENT 206 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.2.7 MULTI_STATUS 207 WEBDAV RFC 2518, Section 10.2 IM_USED 226 Delta encoding in HTTP, RFC 3229, Section 10.4.1 MULTIPLE_CHOICES 300 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.3.1 MOVED_PERMANENTLY 301 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.3.2 FOUND 302 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.3.3 SEE_OTHER 303 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.3.4 NOT_MODIFIED 304 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.3.5 USE_PROXY 305 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.3.6 TEMPORARY_REDIRECT 307 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.3.8 BAD_REQUEST 400 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.4.1 UNAUTHORIZED 401 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.4.2 PAYMENT_REQUIRED 402 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.4.3 FORBIDDEN 403 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.4.4 NOT_FOUND 404 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.4.5 METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED 405 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.4.6 NOT_ACCEPTABLE 406 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.4.7 PROXY_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED 407 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.4.8 REQUEST_TIMEOUT 408 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.4.9 CONFLICT 409 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.4.10 GONE 410 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.4.11 LENGTH_REQUIRED 411 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.4.12 PRECONDITION_FAILED 412 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.4.13 REQUEST_ENTITY_TOO_LARGE 413 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.4.14 REQUEST_URI_TOO_LONG 414 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.4.15 UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE 415 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.4.16 REQUESTED_RANGE_NOT_SATISFIABLE 416 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.4.17 EXPECTATION_FAILED 417 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.4.18 UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY 422 WEBDAV, RFC 2518, Section 10.3 LOCKED 423 WEBDAV RFC 2518, Section 10.4 FAILED_DEPENDENCY 424 WEBDAV, RFC 2518, Section 10.5 UPGRADE_REQUIRED 426 HTTP Upgrade to TLS, RFC 2817, Section 6 INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR 500 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.5.1 NOT_IMPLEMENTED 501 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.5.2 BAD_GATEWAY 502 HTTP/1.1 RFC 2616, Section 10.5.3 SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE 503 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.5.4 GATEWAY_TIMEOUT 504 HTTP/1.1 RFC 2616, Section 10.5.5 HTTP_VERSION_NOT_SUPPORTED 505 HTTP/1.1, RFC 2616, Section 10.5.6 INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE 507 WEBDAV, RFC 2518, Section 10.6 NOT_EXTENDED 510 An HTTP Extension Framework, RFC 2774, Section 7 httplib.responses¶ This dictionary maps the HTTP 1.1 status codes to the W3C names. Example: httplib.responses[httplib.NOT_FOUND] is 'Not Found'. New in version 2.5. 20.7.1. HTTPConnection Objects¶ HTTPConnection instances have the following methods: HTTPConnection.request(method, url[, body[, headers]])¶ This will send a request to the server using the HTTP request method method and the selector url. If the body argument is present, it should be a string of data to send after the headers are finished. Alternatively, it may be an open file object, in which case the contents of the file is sent; this file object should support fileno() and read() methods. The headers argument should be a mapping of extra HTTP headers to send with the request. If one is not provided in headers, a Content-Length header is added automatically for all methods if the length of the body can be determined, either from the length of the str representation, or from the reported size of the file on disk. If body is None the header is not set except for methods that expect a body (PUT, POST, and PATCH) in which case it is set to 0. Changed in version 2.6: body can be a file object. HTTPConnection.getresponse()¶ Should be called after a request is sent to get the response from the server. Returns an HTTPResponse instance. Note Note that you must have read the whole response before you can send a new request to the server. HTTPConnection.set_debuglevel(level)¶ Set the debugging level (the amount of debugging output printed). The default debug level is 0, meaning no debugging output is printed. HTTPConnection.set_tunnel(host, port=None, headers=None)¶ Set the host and the port for HTTP Connect Tunnelling. Normally used when it is required to do HTTPS Conection through a proxy server. The headers argument should be a mapping of extra HTTP headers to send with the CONNECT request. New in version 2.7. HTTPConnection.connect()¶ Connect to the server specified when the object was created. HTTPConnection.close()¶ Close the connection to the server. As an alternative to using the request() method described above, you can also send your request step by step, by using the four functions below. HTTPConnection.putrequest(request, selector[, skip_host[, skip_accept_encoding]])¶ This should be the first call after the connection to the server has been made. It sends a line to the server consisting of the request string, the selector string, and the HTTP version (HTTP/1.1). To disable automatic sending of Host: or Accept-Encoding: headers (for example to accept additional content encodings), specify skip_host or skip_accept_encoding with non-False values. Changed in version 2.4: skip_accept_encoding argument added. HTTPConnection.putheader(header, argument[, ...])¶ Send an RFC 822-style header to the server. It sends a line to the server consisting of the header, a colon and a space, and the first argument. If more arguments are given, continuation lines are sent, each consisting of a tab and an argument. HTTPConnection.endheaders(message_body=None)¶ Send a blank line to the server, signalling the end of the headers. The optional message_body argument can be used to pass a message body associated with the request. The message body will be sent in the same packet as the message headers if it is string, otherwise it is sent in a separate packet. Changed in version 2.7: message_body was added. HTTPConnection.send(data)¶ Send data to the server. This should be used directly only after the endheaders() method has been called and before getresponse() is called. 20.7.2. HTTPResponse Objects¶ HTTPResponse instances have the following methods and attributes: HTTPResponse.read([amt])¶ Reads and returns the response body, or up to the next amt bytes. HTTPResponse.getheader(name[, default])¶ Get the contents of the header name, or default if there is no matching header. HTTPResponse.getheaders()¶ Return a list of (header, value) tuples. New in version 2.4. HTTPResponse.fileno()¶ Returns the fileno of the underlying socket. HTTPResponse.msg¶ A mimetools.Message instance containing the response headers. HTTPResponse.version¶ HTTP protocol version used by server. 10 for HTTP/1.0, 11 for HTTP/1.1. HTTPResponse.status¶ Status code returned by server. HTTPResponse.reason¶ Reason phrase returned by server. 20.7.3. Examples¶ Here is an example session that uses the GET method: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; import httplib &gt;&gt;&gt; conn = httplib.HTTPSConnection(&quot;www.python.org&quot;) &gt;&gt;&gt; conn.request(&quot;GET&quot;, &quot;/&quot;) &gt;&gt;&gt; r1 = conn.getresponse() &gt;&gt;&gt; print r1.status, r1.reason 200 OK &gt;&gt;&gt; data1 = r1.read() &gt;&gt;&gt; conn.request(&quot;GET&quot;, &quot;/&quot;) &gt;&gt;&gt; r2 = conn.getresponse() &gt;&gt;&gt; print r2.status, r2.reason 404 Not Found &gt;&gt;&gt; data2 = r2.read() &gt;&gt;&gt; conn.close() Here is an example session that uses the HEAD method. Note that the HEAD method never returns any data. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; import httplib &gt;&gt;&gt; conn = httplib.HTTPSConnection(&quot;www.python.org&quot;) &gt;&gt;&gt; conn.request(&quot;HEAD&quot;,&quot;/&quot;) &gt;&gt;&gt; res = conn.getresponse() &gt;&gt;&gt; print res.status, res.reason 200 OK &gt;&gt;&gt; data = res.read() &gt;&gt;&gt; print len(data) 0 &gt;&gt;&gt; data == '' True Here is an example session that shows how to POST requests: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; import httplib, urllib &gt;&gt;&gt; params = urllib.urlencode({'@number': 12524, '@type': 'issue', '@action': 'show'}) &gt;&gt;&gt; headers = {&quot;Content-type&quot;: &quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;, ... &quot;Accept&quot;: &quot;text/plain&quot;} &gt;&gt;&gt; conn = httplib.HTTPConnection(&quot;bugs.python.org&quot;) &gt;&gt;&gt; conn.request(&quot;POST&quot;, &quot;&quot;, params, headers) &gt;&gt;&gt; response = conn.getresponse() &gt;&gt;&gt; print response.status, response.reason 302 Found &gt;&gt;&gt; data = response.read() &gt;&gt;&gt; data 'Redirecting to &lt;a href=&quot;http://bugs.python.org/issue12524&quot;&gt;http://bugs.python.org/issue12524&lt;/a&gt;' &gt;&gt;&gt; conn.close() Client side HTTP PUT requests are very similar to POST requests. The difference lies only the server side where HTTP server will allow resources to be created via PUT request. Here is an example session that shows how to do PUT request using httplib: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; # This creates an HTTP message &gt;&gt;&gt; # with the content of BODY as the enclosed representation &gt;&gt;&gt; # for the resource http://localhost:8080/foobar ... &gt;&gt;&gt; import httplib &gt;&gt;&gt; BODY = &quot;***filecontents***&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt; conn = httplib.HTTPConnection(&quot;localhost&quot;, 8080) &gt;&gt;&gt; conn.request(&quot;PUT&quot;, &quot;/file&quot;, BODY) &gt;&gt;&gt; response = conn.getresponse() &gt;&gt;&gt; print response.status, response.reason 200, OK Table Of Contents 20.7. httplib — HTTP protocol client 20.7.1.

But, as other creative urban gardeners and nature lovers have shown, even the smallest of spaces can be turned in a tiny oasis. If all you have is a fire escape, hang up a few bird feeders and you'll have a flurry of feathered visitors in no time. In this simple how-to, we show you how to create a fun, recycled feeder that you can hang from your fire escape or windowsill. It costs next to nothing and anyone can do it—all you need to do is dig through your recycling bin and follow these 8 easy steps! Birdfeeder, How-to, Window, Upcycle, Recycled, Peanut Butter Jar, Urban, DIY, Fire Escape Step One: Gather the materials Gather the materials you’ll need to create your recycled bird feeder. We used: A recycled clean plastic peanut-butter jar with a screw-on lid (any size will do) Lid from a large plastic yogurt container Dremel (you can also use a small electric drill or make do with a Swiss Army Knife, nail, or utility knife) Washer or nut Sturdy string or twine Scissors Birdseed Gorilla Glue or similar strong glue Stick (you could use a bamboo skewer or even a long pencil). Birdfeeder, How-to, Window, Upcycle, Recycled, Peanut Butter Jar, Urban, DIY, Fire Escape Step Two: Drill Holes for the String Drill a small hole in the middle of the yogurt lid, the jar and the jar lid. The hole needs only be big enough to fit the string. Birdfeeder, How-to, Window, Upcycle, Recycled, Peanut Butter Jar, Urban, DIY, Fire Escape Step Three: Cut Feeding Holes Next, make holes for the birds to feed through. Sketch out 3-4 holes with a marker before you begin cutting – make each hole slightly bigger than a half-dollar. Carefully cut out the holes with a utility knife and discard the plastic pieces you cut out. Birdfeeder, How-to, Window, Upcycle, Recycled, Peanut Butter Jar, Urban, DIY, Fire Escape Step Four: Create a perch Using a marker and ruler, mark off two spots exactly opposite from each other slightly below your feeding holes. This is where you will thread through your stick, or feeding perch. Use your drill to make two holes that are sized correctly for the circumference of the stick you are using.

Calculate My Savings! Birdfeeder, How-to, Window, Upcycle, Recycled, Peanut Butter Jar, Urban, DIY, Fire Escape Step Five: String together your birdfeeder Approximate a length of string that is adequate to pass through your birdfeeder with an additional 6-8 inches for hanging, then double it by folding, and then cut your doubled length of string. Folding your piece of string in half, tie the washer or nut to the bottom. Thread the folded end of your string through your birdfeeder, beginning with the yogurt lid, then go through the jar, and finally pull the string through the jar lid. Birdfeeder, How-to, Window, Upcycle, Recycled, Peanut Butter Jar, Urban, DIY, Fire Escape Step Six: Attach Base and Perch Pull the string taut and place the lid on the peanut butter jar. Carefully glue the bottom of the jar to the yogurt lid. Next, thread the perch through the two holes you created and add a dab of the glue to each hole. Let the glue dry for an hour. Birdfeeder, How-to, Window, Upcycle, Recycled, Peanut Butter Jar, Urban, DIY, Fire Escape Step Seven: Add food to your birdfeeder Unscrew the lid and add the birdseed of your choice. As you see here, we used storebought birdseed mixed with peanut butter. Since we knew we were going to be hanging the birdfeeder on a fire escape, we used peanut butter to keep birdseed from falling into the shared yard below our window. If you aren’t worried about seeds scattering, you can fill it will plain birdseed and the yogurt lid will catch most of the extra seeds. Birdfeeder, How-to, Window, Upcycle, Recycled, Peanut Butter Jar, Urban, DIY, Fire Escape Step Eight: Hang it Up! Screw on the peanut butter jar lid, hang up your new recycled bird feeder, and wait for your new feathered friends to stop by for a snack! We tried hanging our bird feeder in a few different locations: here, outside our window hanging from the fire escape above. We also tested the feeder on the fire escape outside our window. We finally decided on hanging the feeder outside our window so we could see the birds when they come to visit. We used an over-the-door coat hook on the top of our window to hold the feeder.

Pass the end through the loop. Twist the loop to create the next hole for the end to pass through. Repeat as often as required to complete the braid. Braiding a Single Rope Details Uses: Braiding several strands is often learned in childhood as a way of controlling long hair. This animation demonstrates how to make a braid with a single piece of rope. Methods: The animation shows the braid being tied with the rope's end being threaded through the loop. In practice braiding is made in the usual way. The strands are manipulated close against the braid ignoring the fact that the end and the loop are getting tangled. Then after adding several braids, the end is pulled clear of the loop. Disclaimer: Any activity that involves ropes is potentially hazardous. Lives may be at risk - possibly your own. Considerable attention and effort have been made to ensure that these descriptions are accurate. However, many critical factors cannot be controlled, including: the choice of materials; the age, size, and condition of ropes; and the accuracy with which these descriptions have been followed.

I found it on Behance by the wonderful artist Wore Vms from Buenos Aires, Argentina. The tutorial is provided both in English &amp; Spanish. I hope it’s useful for you, and you enjoy it 🙂 DIY Parallel calligraphy pen: Necessary materials: -Wooden rod, same width than te pen tip that we want to make. -Offset plate. -Paper masking tape. -Scalpel. -Scissors. -Wooden pin. -Round Nosed Pliers. -Metallic Ruler. -Concrete wall. -Hands (Two). Materiales Necesarios: -Varilla de madera del ancho que queramos hacer la pluma. -Chapa Offset. -Cinta de enmascarar de papel. -Bisturí. -Tijeras. -Broche de madera. -Pinza de puntas redondas. -Regla Metálica. -Pared de cemento. -Manos (dos). Step 1: We cut a long wooden piece out of the stick so we create a comfortable holder. Paso 1: Cortar de la varilla de madera una pieza del largo que creamos cómodo para sostener la pluma mientras escribamos. diy parallel pen tutorial by wore vms Step 2: Scrape one end against the wall until you get two flat sides, to support the two plates that form the tip. Paso 2: Raspar una de las puntas contra la pared hasta lograr dos lados planos, para apoyar las dos chapas que formarán la punta. diy parallel pen_13 There should be some wood on both sides, so that the plates remain separate and thus can be loaded with ink. Entre lado y lado debe quedar un poco de madera, para que las chapas queden separadas y de esta manera se pueda cargar tinta. diy parallel pen_14 Step 3: Mark the plate using the knife and metal ruler. Then fold to separate the metal strip edges and blunt using the same wall. The strip should be more than double of what we believe will measure the tip of our pen. For tips about 1 cm wide and 4 cm long (of which more than half are taped), we cut a strip of 11 cm. Paso 3: Marcar la chapa utilizando el bisturí y la regla metálica. Luego doblar para separar la tira de chapa y desafilar los bordes de la misma utilizando la pared. La tira debe ser de más del doble de lo que creamos que va a medir la punta de nuestra pluma. Para unas puntas de 1 cm de ancho y 4 cm de largo (de los cuales mas de la mitad quedan encintados), yo corté una tira de 11 cm. diy parallel pen_15 Step 4: For each of the faces we did to the rod, we make a notch of about one millimeter in depth, this will keep the plates in place when the pen is assembled. Paso 4: A cada una de las caras que le hicimos a la varilla, le hacemos una muesca de aproximadamente un milímetro de profundidad, esto mantendrá las chapas en su lugar cuando la pluma esté ensamblada. diy parallel pen_16 Step 5: Taking the ends of the sheet, bend in the middle, and then return to open to split it into two. Paso 5: Tomando las puntas de la chapa, la doblamos a la mitad, y luego la volvemos a abrir para partirla en dos. diy parallel pen_17 Step 6: On each sheet we make a slight bend in one end, its doubles will be inserted into the notch we did to the rod. Paso 6: A cada chapa le hacemos un pequeño doblés en una de las puntas, éste doblés irá insertado en la muesca que le hicimos a la varilla. diy parallel pen_01 Step 7: By inserting the bend in the groove, the sheet is pressed against the rod with a flat surface, so that the fold molds to the groove. Paso 7: Insertando el doblés en la muesca, presionamos la chapa con la varilla contra una superficie plana, para que el doblés se amolde a la muesca. diy parallel pen_02 Step 7: We put two plates in their respective notches. Paso 7: Colocamos ambas chapas en sus respectivas muescas. diy parallel pen_03 Step 8: Holding the sheets supported on edge against the table, in position, with folds inserted into the notches of the rod, we made a mark with a scalpel, to know the exact length on which to cut off. Paso 8: Sosteniendo las chapas apoyadas de canto contra la mesa, en su posición, con los dobleces insertados en las muescas de la varilla, realizamos una marca con el bisturí, para saber el largo exacto al que las cortaremos. diy parallel pen_04 The marks should look like this. Así deberían quedar las marcas. diy parallel pen_05 Step 9: Cut the sheets where you did the mark. Paso 9: Cortamos las chapas por donde hicimos la marca.Paso 9: Cortamos las chapas por donde hicimos la marca. diy parallel pen_06 Step 10: We hold both ends in place with a pin and proceed to taping tightly with masking tape. Paso 10: Sostenemos ambas puntas en su posición con un broche y procedemos a encintar firmemente con la cinta de enmascarar. diy parallel pen_07 This should be the pen once taped. Do not worry if the tips are not super-partners, it’s not finished yet. Así debería quedar la pluma una vez encintada. No se preocupen si las puntas no quedan super parejas, todavía no terminamos diy parallel pen_08 Step 11: After we break the clasp, and enter the narrowest point of the same between the tip sheets to keep them separate, we make several cuts with the scalpel. Then we remove the small pieces of triangular plate where we made the cuts, making another cut diagonally *to understand better, look at the final photo*. From there you will download our pen’s ink. When finished, the “teeth” resulting of the pressure with the scalpel, be misaligned, so that they will push the needle nose pliers to make them flat, and will shape both plates, so that their ends stick together after the cuts have been slightly separated. [ad name=”CM”] Paso 11: Desarmamos el broche, e introducimos la punta más angosta del mismo entre las chapas de la punta para mantenerlas separadas, y con el bisturí, realizamos varios cortes. Luego quitamos pequeños pedazos de chapa triangulares donde realizamos los cortes, realizando otro corte en diagonal (para entender mejor, ver última foto). Por aquí descargará la tinta de nuestra pluma. Cuando terminemos, los “dientes” resultantes, por la presión ejercida con el bisturí, quedarán desalineados, por lo que los presionaremos con la pinza de punta para que queden chatos, y también moldearemos ambas chapas para que sus puntas queden pegadas, ya que probablemente luego de los cortes, hayan quedado levemente separadas. diy parallel pen_09Step 12: Now, we will match the ends gently scraping against the wall until both remain the same length, and until we don’t notice roughness on the sheet in which we make cuts, which will be the writing paper. Paso 12: Ahora, emparejaremos las puntas raspándolas suavemente contra la pared hasta que ambas queden del mismo largo, y no notemos asperezas en la chapa en la que no realizamos cortes, que será la que se deslizará sobre el papel al escribir. diy parallel pen_10This should be our finished and ready-to-use pen! We hope you learn and enjoy writing with it. Así es como debería verse nuestra pluma terminada. Espero que les sirva y que disfruten escribiendo con esta pluma. diy parallel pen_11 DIY Gothic calligraphy pen: Required materials: Offset plate Wood stick Masking tape (paper ones) Scissors Scalpel (paper knife) Metallic ruler Hammer A carpeted floor or a soft-steady surface Pink pin Concrete wall Hands (two) Time to read well each step &amp; patience Materiales necesarios: Chapa offset Varilla de madera Cinta de enmascarar (de papel) Tijeras Bisturí (cortapapeles) Regla metálica Martillo Piso con alfombra o alguna superficie blanda y firme Alfiler rosado Pared de cemento Manos (dos) Tiempo para leer bien cada paso y paciencia Step 1: With the scissors, cut a rectangle out of the plate, in a bigger size than the necessary to make the pen. Then, with the ruler’s help and the scalpel, trace two parallel lines, when the space between the lines should be the desired stroke width our pen will have. Paso 1: Con las tijeras, recortar un rectángulo de chapa offset, de un tamaño bastante más grande de lo necesario para hacer la pluma. Luego, con ayuda de una regla y un bisturí, trazar dos líneas paralelas, la separación entre estas líneas será del ancho del trazo que deseemos para nuestra pluma. diy gothic pen_07Step 2: Using both hands in the same position shown in the picture, bend the plate by one of the marks, and then bend to the other side, this way you will get a perfect cut. After that repeat the process with the other mark. Paso 2: Utilizando ambas manos en la posición observada en la fotografía, doblamos la chapa por una de las marcas, y luego para el lado contrario, logrando de esta manera un corte perfecto. Luego repetimos la operación con la otra marca. diy gothic pen_08 Step 3: With the scalpel, or by gently rubbing against a concrete wall, we blunt the plate edges. This will prevent stupid people like me from being cut. Paso 3: Con la ayuda del bisturí, o frotando suavemente contra una pared de cemento, desafilamos los bordes de la chapa. Esto evitará que boludos como yo se corten. diy gothic pen_09Step 4: We will do a cut in one of the extremes of the wood stick, it will be about 2-3 centimeters deep. This will be the pen’s body. The pictured stick looks like that because it belonged to an older pen that was broken, so its dyed with ink and sticky, due to earlier masking tape used on it. Paso 4: A la varilla de madera le haremos un corte en una de sus puntas, de unos dos o tres centímetros de profundidad. Este será el cuerpo de la pluma.La varilla de la foto se vé así por que era de una pluma anterior que se rompió, por lo tanto está teñida con tinta y con pegotes de la cinta de enmascarar que tenía anteriormente. diy gothic pen_10Step 5: We take the plate and put it in the cut we did in the wooden stick, and we do a little scratch, approximately two centimeters away form the stick’s end. The place where the mark is placed will be the pen’s nib end, and the scratch, later will indicate where to bend the plate and make the holes to it. Paso 5: Tomamos la tira de chapa e insertamos una de sus puntas en el corte realizado en la punta de la varilla de madera, y dejando unos dos centímetros, aproximadamente, raspamos suavemente con el bisturí. El lugar donde está la marca será la punta de la pluma, e indicará por donde debemos doblar mas tarde la chapa y donde perforarla. diy gothic pen_11Step 6: Using the pink pin and the hammer, we will make some holes on the plate. It’s very important to do it over a soft surface, so the pin can pierce the plate and go across it. It’s also very important to be very precise and make the holes perfectly aligned. Paso 6: Con la ayuda de un alfiler rosado y un martillo (si algún hombre tiene problemas con los alfileres rosados pueden usar uno celeste, así se sienten mas machitos), practicaremos unas perforaciones. Es importante hacerlo sobre una superficie blanda para que el alfiler pueda pasar de lado a lado. También es muy importante ser prolijo y que las perforaciones queden perfectamente alineadas. diy gothic pen_01Step 7: When the pin gets through the plate, it will raise sharp edges around the holes. Gently rub them against the wall, and then turn and rub the opposite side, because when you rub it the first time, the edges can turn to the other side instead of detaching. After doing this, use your fingertip to check there’s no edges left. If there is something, repeat the operation. Paso 7: Al pasar el alfiler, del lado inferior de la chapa las perforaciones tienen que haber quedado con sus bordes levantados. Frótenlos suavemente contra la pared, y luego froten el lado opuesto, por que cuando froten la primera vez puede que parte de los bordes pasen hacia el otro lado, en vez de desprenderse. Pasamos un dedo y comprobamos que las perforaciones no tengan filo ni bordes sobresalientes para ningún lado. Si tuvieran alguno, repetir la operación. diy gothic pen_02Step 8: Now, while being very careful, bend the plate using your hands, and make the holes match the edge of the nib. The holes will drain the ink from the nib to the paper. Depending on the kind of ink you use, there can be more or less holes, you will have to make some experiments to find out how many holes you need. To my homemade ink (my brand is Write 24-7), I make 4 holes in a 1cm wide nib. The plate must be bent but not too much, if you press it too hard it will split in two and you will have to start again. With the plate bent, introduce it in the stick, and cut the plate surplus. Paso 8: Doblamos la chapa, con mucho cuidado y usando las manos, por la línea de perforaciones, haciendo que éstas queden justo en la punta de la pluma, por allí se producirá la descarga de tinta. Dependiendo del tipo de tinta que usen, diferente cantidad de perforaciones darán diferentes resultados, deberán experimentar para saber cuántas perforaciones son las ideales para una descarga apropiada. Para la tinta Write 24-7 yo utilizo 4 perforaciones para una pluma de 1 cm. La chapa debe quedar doblada pero no del todo, caso contrario la chapa se cortará por el doblés y habrá que comenzar nuevamente. Una vez doblada, introducirla en la varilla de madera, y cortar el sobrante de chapa. diy gothic pen_03Step 9: Now wrap the pen and the plate toghether with masking tape. Put several rounds of tape around the nib, this will hold your nib tight, so don’t spare tape here.. Paso 9: Envolvemos el extremo de la varilla que sostiene la chapa con varias vueltas de cinta de pintor, esto le dará firmeza a la punta, así que no escatimen en cinta. diy gothic pen_04The result should look like this: El resultado debería verse similar a esto: diy gothic pen_05Step 10: Test the pen, and if it works fine, enjoy it. If not, blunt the tip and test it, keep doing it until it works. If it gets broken before achieving a good result, make the pen again. Sometimes it just won’t work correctly, but the good news is the time it takes to do the entire process is about 15 minutes or less. I hope this will be helpful, greetings! Paso 10: Probar la pluma, y si funciona, a disfrutar, si no, a desafilar la punta, y si se rompe, a hacerla nuevamente, hasta yo que la sé hacer, muchas veces y sin razón aparente, fabrico alguna pluma que no funciona como esperaba. Lo único bueno es que el proceso entero lleva unos 15 minutos o menos. Espero les sirva, saludos a todos! diy gothic pen_06Follow Wore Vms works on:https://www.facebook.com/originalwore https://instagram.com/originalwore Hope you enjoyed this tutorials as much as I did when I found it.

                   NS1:content=" Navigation index modules | next | previous | Python » Documentation » The Python Standard Library » 15. Generic Operating System Services » 15.4. argparse — Parser for command-line options, arguments and sub-commands¶ New in version 2.7. Source code: Lib/argparse.py Tutorial This page contains the API reference information. For a more gentle introduction to Python command-line parsing, have a look at the argparse tutorial. The argparse module makes it easy to write user-friendly command-line interfaces. The program defines what arguments it requires, and argparse will figure out how to parse those out of sys.argv. The argparse module also automatically generates help and usage messages and issues errors when users give the program invalid arguments. 15.4.1. Example¶ The following code is a Python program that takes a list of integers and produces either the sum or the max: import argparse parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Process some integers.') parser.add_argument('integers', metavar='N', type=int, nargs='+', help='an integer for the accumulator') parser.add_argument('--sum', dest='accumulate', action='store_const', const=sum, default=max, help='sum the integers (default: find the max)') args = parser.parse_args() print args.accumulate(args.integers) Assuming the Python code above is saved into a file called prog.py, it can be run at the command line and provides useful help messages: $ python prog.py -h usage: prog.py [-h] [--sum] N [N ...] Process some integers. positional arguments: N an integer for the accumulator optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit --sum sum the integers (default: find the max) When run with the appropriate arguments, it prints either the sum or the max of the command-line integers: $ python prog.py 1 2 3 4 4 $ python prog.py 1 2 3 4 --sum 10 If invalid arguments are passed in, it will issue an error: $ python prog.py a b c usage: prog.py [-h] [--sum] N [N ...] prog.py: error: argument N: invalid int value: 'a' The following sections walk you through this example. 15.4.1.1. Creating a parser¶ The first step in using the argparse is creating an ArgumentParser object: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Process some integers.') The ArgumentParser object will hold all the information necessary to parse the command line into Python data types. 15.4.1.2. Adding arguments¶ Filling an ArgumentParser with information about program arguments is done by making calls to the add_argument() method. Generally, these calls tell the ArgumentParser how to take the strings on the command line and turn them into objects. This information is stored and used when parse_args() is called. For example: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('integers', metavar='N', type=int, nargs='+', ... help='an integer for the accumulator') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--sum', dest='accumulate', action='store_const', ... const=sum, default=max, ... help='sum the integers (default: find the max)') Later, calling parse_args() will return an object with two attributes, integers and accumulate. The integers attribute will be a list of one or more ints, and the accumulate attribute will be either the sum() function, if --sum was specified at the command line, or the max() function if it was not. 15.4.1.3. Parsing arguments¶ ArgumentParser parses arguments through the parse_args() method. This will inspect the command line, convert each argument to the appropriate type and then invoke the appropriate action. In most cases, this means a simple Namespace object will be built up from attributes parsed out of the command line: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['--sum', '7', '-1', '42']) Namespace(accumulate=&lt;built-in function sum&gt;, integers=[7, -1, 42]) In a script, parse_args() will typically be called with no arguments, and the ArgumentParser will automatically determine the command-line arguments from sys.argv. 15.4.2. ArgumentParser objects¶ class argparse.ArgumentParser(prog=None, usage=None, description=None, epilog=None, parents=[], formatter_class=argparse.HelpFormatter, prefix_chars='-', fromfile_prefix_chars=None, argument_default=None, conflict_handler='error', add_help=True)¶ Create a new ArgumentParser object. All parameters should be passed as keyword arguments. Each parameter has its own more detailed description below, but in short they are: prog - The name of the program (default: sys.argv[0]) usage - The string describing the program usage (default: generated from arguments added to parser) description - Text to display before the argument help (default: none) epilog - Text to display after the argument help (default: none) parents - A list of ArgumentParser objects whose arguments should also be included formatter_class - A class for customizing the help output prefix_chars - The set of characters that prefix optional arguments (default: ‘-‘) fromfile_prefix_chars - The set of characters that prefix files from which additional arguments should be read (default: None) argument_default - The global default value for arguments (default: None) conflict_handler - The strategy for resolving conflicting optionals (usually unnecessary) add_help - Add a -h/–help option to the parser (default: True) The following sections describe how each of these are used. 15.4.2.1. prog¶ By default, ArgumentParser objects uses sys.argv[0] to determine how to display the name of the program in help messages. This default is almost always desirable because it will make the help messages match how the program was invoked on the command line. For example, consider a file named myprogram.py with the following code: import argparse parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() parser.add_argument('--foo', help='foo help') args = parser.parse_args() The help for this program will display myprogram.py as the program name (regardless of where the program was invoked from): $ python myprogram.py --help usage: myprogram.py [-h] [--foo FOO] optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit --foo FOO foo help $ cd .. $ python subdir\myprogram.py --help usage: myprogram.py [-h] [--foo FOO] optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit --foo FOO foo help To change this default behavior, another value can be supplied using the prog= argument to ArgumentParser: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='myprogram') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.print_help() usage: myprogram [-h] optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit Note that the program name, whether determined from sys.argv[0] or from the prog= argument, is available to help messages using the %(prog)s format specifier. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='myprogram') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo', help='foo of the %(prog)s program') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.print_help() usage: myprogram [-h] [--foo FOO] optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit --foo FOO foo of the myprogram program 15.4.2.2. usage¶ By default, ArgumentParser calculates the usage message from the arguments it contains: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='PROG') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo', nargs='?', help='foo help') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('bar', nargs='+', help='bar help') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.print_help() usage: PROG [-h] [--foo [FOO]] bar [bar ...] positional arguments: bar bar help optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit --foo [FOO] foo help The default message can be overridden with the usage= keyword argument: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='PROG', usage='%(prog)s [options]') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo', nargs='?', help='foo help') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('bar', nargs='+', help='bar help') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.print_help() usage: PROG [options] positional arguments: bar bar help optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit --foo [FOO] foo help The %(prog)s format specifier is available to fill in the program name in your usage messages. 15.4.2.3. description¶ Most calls to the ArgumentParser constructor will use the description= keyword argument. This argument gives a brief description of what the program does and how it works. In help messages, the description is displayed between the command-line usage string and the help messages for the various arguments: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='A foo that bars') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.print_help() usage: argparse.py [-h] A foo that bars optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit By default, the description will be line-wrapped so that it fits within the given space. To change this behavior, see the formatter_class argument. 15.4.2.4. epilog¶ Some programs like to display additional description of the program after the description of the arguments. Such text can be specified using the epilog= argument to ArgumentParser: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser( ... description='A foo that bars', ... epilog=&quot;And that's how you'd foo a bar&quot;) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.print_help() usage: argparse.py [-h] A foo that bars optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit And that's how you'd foo a bar As with the description argument, the epilog= text is by default line-wrapped, but this behavior can be adjusted with the formatter_class argument to ArgumentParser. 15.4.2.5. parents¶ Sometimes, several parsers share a common set of arguments. Rather than repeating the definitions of these arguments, a single parser with all the shared arguments and passed to parents= argument to ArgumentParser can be used. The parents= argument takes a list of ArgumentParser objects, collects all the positional and optional actions from them, and adds these actions to the ArgumentParser object being constructed: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parent_parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(add_help=False) &gt;&gt;&gt; parent_parser.add_argument('--parent', type=int) &gt;&gt;&gt; foo_parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(parents=[parent_parser]) &gt;&gt;&gt; foo_parser.add_argument('foo') &gt;&gt;&gt; foo_parser.parse_args(['--parent', '2', 'XXX']) Namespace(foo='XXX', parent=2) &gt;&gt;&gt; bar_parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(parents=[parent_parser]) &gt;&gt;&gt; bar_parser.add_argument('--bar') &gt;&gt;&gt; bar_parser.parse_args(['--bar', 'YYY']) Namespace(bar='YYY', parent=None) Note that most parent parsers will specify add_help=False. Otherwise, the ArgumentParser will see two -h/--help options (one in the parent and one in the child) and raise an error. Note You must fully initialize the parsers before passing them via parents=. If you change the parent parsers after the child parser, those changes will not be reflected in the child. 15.4.2.6. formatter_class¶ ArgumentParser objects allow the help formatting to be customized by specifying an alternate formatting class. Currently, there are three such classes: class argparse.RawDescriptionHelpFormatter¶ class argparse.RawTextHelpFormatter¶ class argparse.ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter¶ The first two allow more control over how textual descriptions are displayed, while the last automatically adds information about argument default values. By default, ArgumentParser objects line-wrap the description and epilog texts in command-line help messages: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser( ... prog='PROG', ... description='''this description ... was indented weird ... but that is okay''', ... epilog=''' ... likewise for this epilog whose whitespace will ... be cleaned up and whose words will be wrapped ... across a couple lines''') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.print_help() usage: PROG [-h] this description was indented weird but that is okay optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit likewise for this epilog whose whitespace will be cleaned up and whose words will be wrapped across a couple lines Passing RawDescriptionHelpFormatter as formatter_class= indicates that description and epilog are already correctly formatted and should not be line-wrapped: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser( ... prog='PROG', ... formatter_class=argparse.RawDescriptionHelpFormatter, ... description=textwrap.dedent('''\ ... Please do not mess up this text! ... -------------------------------- ... I have indented it ... exactly the way ... I want it ... ''')) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.print_help() usage: PROG [-h] Please do not mess up this text! -------------------------------- I have indented it exactly the way I want it optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit RawTextHelpFormatter maintains whitespace for all sorts of help text, including argument descriptions. The other formatter class available, ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter, will add information about the default value of each of the arguments: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser( ... prog='PROG', ... formatter_class=argparse.ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo', type=int, default=42, help='FOO!') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('bar', nargs='*', default=[1, 2, 3], help='BAR!') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.print_help() usage: PROG [-h] [--foo FOO] [bar [bar ...]] positional arguments: bar BAR! (default: [1, 2, 3]) optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit --foo FOO FOO! (default: 42) 15.4.2.7. prefix_chars¶ Most command-line options will use - as the prefix, e.g. -f/--foo. Parsers that need to support different or additional prefix characters, e.g. for options like +f or /foo, may specify them using the prefix_chars= argument to the ArgumentParser constructor: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='PROG', prefix_chars='-+') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('+f') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('++bar') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args('+f X ++bar Y'.split()) Namespace(bar='Y', f='X') The prefix_chars= argument defaults to '-'. Supplying a set of characters that does not include - will cause -f/--foo options to be disallowed. 15.4.2.8. fromfile_prefix_chars¶ Sometimes, for example when dealing with a particularly long argument lists, it may make sense to keep the list of arguments in a file rather than typing it out at the command line. If the fromfile_prefix_chars= argument is given to the ArgumentParser constructor, then arguments that start with any of the specified characters will be treated as files, and will be replaced by the arguments they contain. For example: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; with open('args.txt', 'w') as fp: ... fp.write('-f\nbar') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(fromfile_prefix_chars='@') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('-f') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['-f', 'foo', '@args.txt']) Namespace(f='bar') Arguments read from a file must by default be one per line (but see also convert_arg_line_to_args()) and are treated as if they were in the same place as the original file referencing argument on the command line. So in the example above, the expression ['-f', 'foo', '@args.txt'] is considered equivalent to the expression ['-f', 'foo', '-f', 'bar']. The fromfile_prefix_chars= argument defaults to None, meaning that arguments will never be treated as file references. 15.4.2.9. argument_default¶ Generally, argument defaults are specified either by passing a default to add_argument() or by calling the set_defaults() methods with a specific set of name-value pairs. Sometimes however, it may be useful to specify a single parser-wide default for arguments. This can be accomplished by passing the argument_default= keyword argument to ArgumentParser. For example, to globally suppress attribute creation on parse_args() calls, we supply argument_default=SUPPRESS: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(argument_default=argparse.SUPPRESS) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('bar', nargs='?') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['--foo', '1', 'BAR']) Namespace(bar='BAR', foo='1') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args([]) Namespace() 15.4.2.10. conflict_handler¶ ArgumentParser objects do not allow two actions with the same option string. By default, ArgumentParser objects raises an exception if an attempt is made to create an argument with an option string that is already in use: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='PROG') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('-f', '--foo', help='old foo help') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo', help='new foo help') Traceback (most recent call last): .. ArgumentError: argument --foo: conflicting option string(s): --foo Sometimes (e.g. when using parents) it may be useful to simply override any older arguments with the same option string. To get this behavior, the value 'resolve' can be supplied to the conflict_handler= argument of ArgumentParser: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='PROG', conflict_handler='resolve') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('-f', '--foo', help='old foo help') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo', help='new foo help') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.print_help() usage: PROG [-h] [-f FOO] [--foo FOO] optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit -f FOO old foo help --foo FOO new foo help Note that ArgumentParser objects only remove an action if all of its option strings are overridden. So, in the example above, the old -f/--foo action is retained as the -f action, because only the --foo option string was overridden. 15.4.2.11. add_help¶ By default, ArgumentParser objects add an option which simply displays the parser’s help message. For example, consider a file named myprogram.py containing the following code: import argparse parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() parser.add_argument('--foo', help='foo help') args = parser.parse_args() If -h or --help is supplied at the command line, the ArgumentParser help will be printed: $ python myprogram.py --help usage: myprogram.py [-h] [--foo FOO] optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit --foo FOO foo help Occasionally, it may be useful to disable the addition of this help option. This can be achieved by passing False as the add_help= argument to ArgumentParser: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='PROG', add_help=False) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo', help='foo help') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.print_help() usage: PROG [--foo FOO] optional arguments: --foo FOO foo help The help option is typically -h/--help. The exception to this is if the prefix_chars= is specified and does not include -, in which case -h and --help are not valid options. In this case, the first character in prefix_chars is used to prefix the help options: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='PROG', prefix_chars='+/') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.print_help() usage: PROG [+h] optional arguments: +h, ++help show this help message and exit 15.4.3. The add_argument() method¶ ArgumentParser.add_argument(name or flags...[, action][, nargs][, const][, default][, type][, choices][, required][, help][, metavar][, dest])¶ Define how a single command-line argument should be parsed. Each parameter has its own more detailed description below, but in short they are: name or flags - Either a name or a list of option strings, e.g. foo or -f, --foo. action - The basic type of action to be taken when this argument is encountered at the command line. nargs - The number of command-line arguments that should be consumed. const - A constant value required by some action and nargs selections. default - The value produced if the argument is absent from the command line. type - The type to which the command-line argument should be converted. choices - A container of the allowable values for the argument. required - Whether or not the command-line option may be omitted (optionals only). help - A brief description of what the argument does. metavar - A name for the argument in usage messages. dest - The name of the attribute to be added to the object returned by parse_args(). The following sections describe how each of these are used. 15.4.3.1. name or flags¶ The add_argument() method must know whether an optional argument, like -f or --foo, or a positional argument, like a list of filenames, is expected. The first arguments passed to add_argument() must therefore be either a series of flags, or a simple argument name. For example, an optional argument could be created like: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('-f', '--foo') while a positional argument could be created like: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('bar') When parse_args() is called, optional arguments will be identified by the - prefix, and the remaining arguments will be assumed to be positional: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='PROG') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('-f', '--foo') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('bar') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['BAR']) Namespace(bar='BAR', foo=None) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['BAR', '--foo', 'FOO']) Namespace(bar='BAR', foo='FOO') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['--foo', 'FOO']) usage: PROG [-h] [-f FOO] bar PROG: error: too few arguments 15.4.3.2. action¶ ArgumentParser objects associate command-line arguments with actions. These actions can do just about anything with the command-line arguments associated with them, though most actions simply add an attribute to the object returned by parse_args(). The action keyword argument specifies how the command-line arguments should be handled. The supplied actions are: 'store' - This just stores the argument’s value. This is the default action. For example: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args('--foo 1'.split()) Namespace(foo='1') 'store_const' - This stores the value specified by the const keyword argument. The 'store_const' action is most commonly used with optional arguments that specify some sort of flag. For example: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo', action='store_const', const=42) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['--foo']) Namespace(foo=42) 'store_true' and 'store_false' - These are special cases of 'store_const' using for storing the values True and False respectively. In addition, they create default values of False and True respectively. For example: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo', action='store_true') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--bar', action='store_false') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--baz', action='store_false') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args('--foo --bar'.split()) Namespace(bar=False, baz=True, foo=True) 'append' - This stores a list, and appends each argument value to the list. This is useful to allow an option to be specified multiple times. Example usage: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo', action='append') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args('--foo 1 --foo 2'.split()) Namespace(foo=['1', '2']) 'append_const' - This stores a list, and appends the value specified by the const keyword argument to the list. (Note that the const keyword argument defaults to None.) The 'append_const' action is typically useful when multiple arguments need to store constants to the same list. For example: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--str', dest='types', action='append_const', const=str) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--int', dest='types', action='append_const', const=int) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args('--str --int'.split()) Namespace(types=[&lt;type 'str'&gt;, &lt;type 'int'&gt;]) 'count' - This counts the number of times a keyword argument occurs. For example, this is useful for increasing verbosity levels: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--verbose', '-v', action='count') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['-vvv']) Namespace(verbose=3) 'help' - This prints a complete help message for all the options in the current parser and then exits. By default a help action is automatically added to the parser. See ArgumentParser for details of how the output is created. 'version' - This expects a version= keyword argument in the add_argument() call, and prints version information and exits when invoked: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; import argparse &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='PROG') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--version', action='version', version='%(prog)s 2.0') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['--version']) PROG 2.0 You may also specify an arbitrary action by passing an Action subclass or other object that implements the same interface. The recommended way to do this is to extend Action, overriding the __call__ method and optionally the __init__ method. An example of a custom action: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; class FooAction(argparse.Action): ... def __init__(self, option_strings, dest, nargs=None, **kwargs): ... if nargs is not None: ... raise ValueError(&quot;nargs not allowed&quot;) ... super(FooAction, self).__init__(option_strings, dest, **kwargs) ... def __call__(self, parser, namespace, values, option_string=None): ... print '%r %r %r' % (namespace, values, option_string) ... setattr(namespace, self.dest, values) ... &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo', action=FooAction) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('bar', action=FooAction) &gt;&gt;&gt; args = parser.parse_args('1 --foo 2'.split()) Namespace(bar=None, foo=None) '1' None Namespace(bar='1', foo=None) '2' '--foo' &gt;&gt;&gt; args Namespace(bar='1', foo='2') For more details, see Action. 15.4.3.3. nargs¶ ArgumentParser objects usually associate a single command-line argument with a single action to be taken. The nargs keyword argument associates a different number of command-line arguments with a single action. The supported values are: N (an integer). N arguments from the command line will be gathered together into a list. For example: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo', nargs=2) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('bar', nargs=1) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args('c --foo a b'.split()) Namespace(bar=['c'], foo=['a', 'b']) Note that nargs=1 produces a list of one item. This is different from the default, in which the item is produced by itself. '?'. One argument will be consumed from the command line if possible, and produced as a single item. If no command-line argument is present, the value from default will be produced. Note that for optional arguments, there is an additional case - the option string is present but not followed by a command-line argument. In this case the value from const will be produced. Some examples to illustrate this: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo', nargs='?', const='c', default='d') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('bar', nargs='?', default='d') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['XX', '--foo', 'YY']) Namespace(bar='XX', foo='YY') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['XX', '--foo']) Namespace(bar='XX', foo='c') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args([]) Namespace(bar='d', foo='d') One of the more common uses of nargs='?' is to allow optional input and output files: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('infile', nargs='?', type=argparse.FileType('r'), ... default=sys.stdin) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('outfile', nargs='?', type=argparse.FileType('w'), ... default=sys.stdout) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['input.txt', 'output.txt']) Namespace(infile=&lt;open file 'input.txt', mode 'r' at 0x...&gt;, outfile=&lt;open file 'output.txt', mode 'w' at 0x...&gt;) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args([]) Namespace(infile=&lt;open file '&lt;stdin&gt;', mode 'r' at 0x...&gt;, outfile=&lt;open file '&lt;stdout&gt;', mode 'w' at 0x...&gt;) '*'. All command-line arguments present are gathered into a list. Note that it generally doesn’t make much sense to have more than one positional argument with nargs='*', but multiple optional arguments with nargs='*' is possible. For example: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo', nargs='*') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--bar', nargs='*') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('baz', nargs='*') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args('a b --foo x y --bar 1 2'.split()) Namespace(bar=['1', '2'], baz=['a', 'b'], foo=['x', 'y']) '+'. Just like '*', all command-line args present are gathered into a list. Additionally, an error message will be generated if there wasn’t at least one command-line argument present. For example: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='PROG') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('foo', nargs='+') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['a', 'b']) Namespace(foo=['a', 'b']) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args([]) usage: PROG [-h] foo [foo ...] PROG: error: too few arguments argparse.REMAINDER. All the remaining command-line arguments are gathered into a list. This is commonly useful for command line utilities that dispatch to other command line utilities: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='PROG') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('command') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('args', nargs=argparse.REMAINDER) &gt;&gt;&gt; print parser.parse_args('--foo B cmd --arg1 XX ZZ'.split()) Namespace(args=['--arg1', 'XX', 'ZZ'], command='cmd', foo='B') If the nargs keyword argument is not provided, the number of arguments consumed is determined by the action. Generally this means a single command-line argument will be consumed and a single item (not a list) will be produced. 15.4.3.4. const¶ The const argument of add_argument() is used to hold constant values that are not read from the command line but are required for the various ArgumentParser actions. The two most common uses of it are: When add_argument() is called with action='store_const' or action='append_const'. These actions add the const value to one of the attributes of the object returned by parse_args(). See the action description for examples. When add_argument() is called with option strings (like -f or --foo) and nargs='?'. This creates an optional argument that can be followed by zero or one command-line arguments. When parsing the command line, if the option string is encountered with no command-line argument following it, the value of const will be assumed instead. See the nargs description for examples. With the 'store_const' and 'append_const' actions, the const keyword argument must be given. For other actions, it defaults to None. 15.4.3.5. default¶ All optional arguments and some positional arguments may be omitted at the command line. The default keyword argument of add_argument(), whose value defaults to None, specifies what value should be used if the command-line argument is not present. For optional arguments, the default value is used when the option string was not present at the command line: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo', default=42) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['--foo', '2']) Namespace(foo='2') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args([]) Namespace(foo=42) If the default value is a string, the parser parses the value as if it were a command-line argument. In particular, the parser applies any type conversion argument, if provided, before setting the attribute on the Namespace return value. Otherwise, the parser uses the value as is: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--length', default='10', type=int) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--width', default=10.5, type=int) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args() Namespace(length=10, width=10.5) For positional arguments with nargs equal to ? or *, the default value is used when no command-line argument was present: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('foo', nargs='?', default=42) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['a']) Namespace(foo='a') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args([]) Namespace(foo=42) Providing default=argparse.SUPPRESS causes no attribute to be added if the command-line argument was not present.: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo', default=argparse.SUPPRESS) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args([]) Namespace() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['--foo', '1']) Namespace(foo='1') 15.4.3.6. type¶ By default, ArgumentParser objects read command-line arguments in as simple strings. However, quite often the command-line string should instead be interpreted as another type, like a float or int. The type keyword argument of add_argument() allows any necessary type-checking and type conversions to be performed. Common built-in types and functions can be used directly as the value of the type argument: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('foo', type=int) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('bar', type=file) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args('2 temp.txt'.split()) Namespace(bar=&lt;open file 'temp.txt', mode 'r' at 0x...&gt;, foo=2) See the section on the default keyword argument for information on when the type argument is applied to default arguments. To ease the use of various types of files, the argparse module provides the factory FileType which takes the mode= and bufsize= arguments of the file object. For example, FileType('w') can be used to create a writable file: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('bar', type=argparse.FileType('w')) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['out.txt']) Namespace(bar=&lt;open file 'out.txt', mode 'w' at 0x...&gt;) type= can take any callable that takes a single string argument and returns the converted value: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; def perfect_square(string): ... value = int(string) ... sqrt = math.sqrt(value) ... if sqrt != int(sqrt): ... msg = &quot;%r is not a perfect square&quot; % string ... raise argparse.ArgumentTypeError(msg) ... return value ... &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='PROG') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('foo', type=perfect_square) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['9']) Namespace(foo=9) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['7']) usage: PROG [-h] foo PROG: error: argument foo: '7' is not a perfect square The choices keyword argument may be more convenient for type checkers that simply check against a range of values: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='PROG') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('foo', type=int, choices=xrange(5, 10)) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['7']) Namespace(foo=7) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['11']) usage: PROG [-h] {5,6,7,8,9} PROG: error: argument foo: invalid choice: 11 (choose from 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) See the choices section for more details. 15.4.3.7. choices¶ Some command-line arguments should be selected from a restricted set of values. These can be handled by passing a container object as the choices keyword argument to add_argument(). When the command line is parsed, argument values will be checked, and an error message will be displayed if the argument was not one of the acceptable values: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='game.py') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('move', choices=['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['rock']) Namespace(move='rock') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['fire']) usage: game.py [-h] {rock,paper,scissors} game.py: error: argument move: invalid choice: 'fire' (choose from 'rock', 'paper', 'scissors') Note that inclusion in the choices container is checked after any type conversions have been performed, so the type of the objects in the choices container should match the type specified: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='doors.py') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('door', type=int, choices=range(1, 4)) &gt;&gt;&gt; print(parser.parse_args(['3'])) Namespace(door=3) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['4']) usage: doors.py [-h] {1,2,3} doors.py: error: argument door: invalid choice: 4 (choose from 1, 2, 3) Any object that supports the in operator can be passed as the choices value, so dict objects, set objects, custom containers, etc. are all supported. 15.4.3.8. required¶ In general, the argparse module assumes that flags like -f and --bar indicate optional arguments, which can always be omitted at the command line. To make an option required, True can be specified for the required= keyword argument to add_argument(): &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo', required=True) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['--foo', 'BAR']) Namespace(foo='BAR') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args([]) usage: argparse.py [-h] [--foo FOO] argparse.py: error: option --foo is required As the example shows, if an option is marked as required, parse_args() will report an error if that option is not present at the command line. Note Required options are generally considered bad form because users expect options to be optional, and thus they should be avoided when possible. 15.4.3.9. help¶ The help value is a string containing a brief description of the argument. When a user requests help (usually by using -h or --help at the command line), these help descriptions will be displayed with each argument: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='frobble') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo', action='store_true', ... help='foo the bars before frobbling') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('bar', nargs='+', ... help='one of the bars to be frobbled') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['-h']) usage: frobble [-h] [--foo] bar [bar ...] positional arguments: bar one of the bars to be frobbled optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit --foo foo the bars before frobbling The help strings can include various format specifiers to avoid repetition of things like the program name or the argument default. The available specifiers include the program name, %(prog)s and most keyword arguments to add_argument(), e.g. %(default)s, %(type)s, etc.: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='frobble') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('bar', nargs='?', type=int, default=42, ... help='the bar to %(prog)s (default: %(default)s)') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.print_help() usage: frobble [-h] [bar] positional arguments: bar the bar to frobble (default: 42) optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit argparse supports silencing the help entry for certain options, by setting the help value to argparse.SUPPRESS: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='frobble') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo', help=argparse.SUPPRESS) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.print_help() usage: frobble [-h] optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit 15.4.3.10. metavar¶ When ArgumentParser generates help messages, it needs some way to refer to each expected argument. By default, ArgumentParser objects use the dest value as the “name” of each object. By default, for positional argument actions, the dest value is used directly, and for optional argument actions, the dest value is uppercased. So, a single positional argument with dest='bar' will be referred to as bar. A single optional argument --foo that should be followed by a single command-line argument will be referred to as FOO. An example: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('bar') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args('X --foo Y'.split()) Namespace(bar='X', foo='Y') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.print_help() usage: [-h] [--foo FOO] bar positional arguments: bar optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit --foo FOO An alternative name can be specified with metavar: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo', metavar='YYY') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('bar', metavar='XXX') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args('X --foo Y'.split()) Namespace(bar='X', foo='Y') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.print_help() usage: [-h] [--foo YYY] XXX positional arguments: XXX optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit --foo YYY Note that metavar only changes the displayed name - the name of the attribute on the parse_args() object is still determined by the dest value. Different values of nargs may cause the metavar to be used multiple times. Providing a tuple to metavar specifies a different display for each of the arguments: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='PROG') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('-x', nargs=2) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo', nargs=2, metavar=('bar', 'baz')) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.print_help() usage: PROG [-h] [-x X X] [--foo bar baz] optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit -x X X --foo bar baz 15.4.3.11. dest¶ Most ArgumentParser actions add some value as an attribute of the object returned by parse_args(). The name of this attribute is determined by the dest keyword argument of add_argument(). For positional argument actions, dest is normally supplied as the first argument to add_argument(): &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('bar') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['XXX']) Namespace(bar='XXX') For optional argument actions, the value of dest is normally inferred from the option strings. ArgumentParser generates the value of dest by taking the first long option string and stripping away the initial -- string. If no long option strings were supplied, dest will be derived from the first short option string by stripping the initial - character. Any internal - characters will be converted to _ characters to make sure the string is a valid attribute name. The examples below illustrate this behavior: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('-f', '--foo-bar', '--foo') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('-x', '-y') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args('-f 1 -x 2'.split()) Namespace(foo_bar='1', x='2') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args('--foo 1 -y 2'.split()) Namespace(foo_bar='1', x='2') dest allows a custom attribute name to be provided: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo', dest='bar') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args('--foo XXX'.split()) Namespace(bar='XXX') 15.4.3.12. Action classes¶ Action classes implement the Action API, a callable which returns a callable which processes arguments from the command-line. Any object which follows this API may be passed as the action parameter to add_argument(). class argparse.Action(option_strings, dest, nargs=None, const=None, default=None, type=None, choices=None, required=False, help=None, metavar=None)¶ Action objects are used by an ArgumentParser to represent the information needed to parse a single argument from one or more strings from the command line. The Action class must accept the two positional arguments plus any keyword arguments passed to ArgumentParser.add_argument() except for the action itself. Instances of Action (or return value of any callable to the action parameter) should have attributes “dest”, “option_strings”, “default”, “type”, “required”, “help”, etc. defined. The easiest way to ensure these attributes are defined is to call Action.__init__. Action instances should be callable, so subclasses must override the __call__ method, which should accept four parameters: parser - The ArgumentParser object which contains this action. namespace - The Namespace object that will be returned by parse_args(). Most actions add an attribute to this object using setattr(). values - The associated command-line arguments, with any type conversions applied. Type conversions are specified with the type keyword argument to add_argument(). option_string - The option string that was used to invoke this action. The option_string argument is optional, and will be absent if the action is associated with a positional argument. The __call__ method may perform arbitrary actions, but will typically set attributes on the namespace based on dest and values. 15.4.4. The parse_args() method¶ ArgumentParser.parse_args(args=None, namespace=None)¶ Convert argument strings to objects and assign them as attributes of the namespace. Return the populated namespace. Previous calls to add_argument() determine exactly what objects are created and how they are assigned. See the documentation for add_argument() for details. By default, the argument strings are taken from sys.argv, and a new empty Namespace object is created for the attributes. 15.4.4.1. Option value syntax¶ The parse_args() method supports several ways of specifying the value of an option (if it takes one). In the simplest case, the option and its value are passed as two separate arguments: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='PROG') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('-x') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['-x', 'X']) Namespace(foo=None, x='X') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['--foo', 'FOO']) Namespace(foo='FOO', x=None) For long options (options with names longer than a single character), the option and value can also be passed as a single command-line argument, using = to separate them: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['--foo=FOO']) Namespace(foo='FOO', x=None) For short options (options only one character long), the option and its value can be concatenated: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['-xX']) Namespace(foo=None, x='X') Several short options can be joined together, using only a single - prefix, as long as only the last option (or none of them) requires a value: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='PROG') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('-x', action='store_true') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('-y', action='store_true') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('-z') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['-xyzZ']) Namespace(x=True, y=True, z='Z') 15.4.4.2. Invalid arguments¶ While parsing the command line, parse_args() checks for a variety of errors, including ambiguous options, invalid types, invalid options, wrong number of positional arguments, etc. When it encounters such an error, it exits and prints the error along with a usage message: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='PROG') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo', type=int) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('bar', nargs='?') &gt;&gt;&gt; # invalid type &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['--foo', 'spam']) usage: PROG [-h] [--foo FOO] [bar] PROG: error: argument --foo: invalid int value: 'spam' &gt;&gt;&gt; # invalid option &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['--bar']) usage: PROG [-h] [--foo FOO] [bar] PROG: error: no such option: --bar &gt;&gt;&gt; # wrong number of arguments &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['spam', 'badger']) usage: PROG [-h] [--foo FOO] [bar] PROG: error: extra arguments found: badger 15.4.4.3. Arguments containing -¶ The parse_args() method attempts to give errors whenever the user has clearly made a mistake, but some situations are inherently ambiguous. For example, the command-line argument -1 could either be an attempt to specify an option or an attempt to provide a positional argument. The parse_args() method is cautious here: positional arguments may only begin with - if they look like negative numbers and there are no options in the parser that look like negative numbers: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='PROG') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('-x') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('foo', nargs='?') &gt;&gt;&gt; # no negative number options, so -1 is a positional argument &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['-x', '-1']) Namespace(foo=None, x='-1') &gt;&gt;&gt; # no negative number options, so -1 and -5 are positional arguments &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['-x', '-1', '-5']) Namespace(foo='-5', x='-1') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='PROG') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('-1', dest='one') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('foo', nargs='?') &gt;&gt;&gt; # negative number options present, so -1 is an option &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['-1', 'X']) Namespace(foo=None, one='X') &gt;&gt;&gt; # negative number options present, so -2 is an option &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['-2']) usage: PROG [-h] [-1 ONE] [foo] PROG: error: no such option: -2 &gt;&gt;&gt; # negative number options present, so both -1s are options &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['-1', '-1']) usage: PROG [-h] [-1 ONE] [foo] PROG: error: argument -1: expected one argument If you have positional arguments that must begin with - and don’t look like negative numbers, you can insert the pseudo-argument '--' which tells parse_args() that everything after that is a positional argument: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['--', '-f']) Namespace(foo='-f', one=None) 15.4.4.4. Argument abbreviations (prefix matching)¶ The parse_args() method allows long options to be abbreviated to a prefix, if the abbreviation is unambiguous (the prefix matches a unique option): &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='PROG') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('-bacon') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('-badger') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args('-bac MMM'.split()) Namespace(bacon='MMM', badger=None) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args('-bad WOOD'.split()) Namespace(bacon=None, badger='WOOD') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args('-ba BA'.split()) usage: PROG [-h] [-bacon BACON] [-badger BADGER] PROG: error: ambiguous option: -ba could match -badger, -bacon An error is produced for arguments that could produce more than one options. 15.4.4.5. Beyond sys.argv¶ Sometimes it may be useful to have an ArgumentParser parse arguments other than those of sys.argv. This can be accomplished by passing a list of strings to parse_args(). This is useful for testing at the interactive prompt: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument( ... 'integers', metavar='int', type=int, choices=xrange(10), ... nargs='+', help='an integer in the range 0..9') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument( ... '--sum', dest='accumulate', action='store_const', const=sum, ... default=max, help='sum the integers (default: find the max)') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['1', '2', '3', '4']) Namespace(accumulate=&lt;built-in function max&gt;, integers=[1, 2, 3, 4]) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['1', '2', '3', '4', '--sum']) Namespace(accumulate=&lt;built-in function sum&gt;, integers=[1, 2, 3, 4]) 15.4.4.6. The Namespace object¶ class argparse.Namespace¶ Simple class used by default by parse_args() to create an object holding attributes and return it. This class is deliberately simple, just an object subclass with a readable string representation. If you prefer to have dict-like view of the attributes, you can use the standard Python idiom, vars(): &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo') &gt;&gt;&gt; args = parser.parse_args(['--foo', 'BAR']) &gt;&gt;&gt; vars(args) {'foo': 'BAR'} It may also be useful to have an ArgumentParser assign attributes to an already existing object, rather than a new Namespace object. This can be achieved by specifying the namespace= keyword argument: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; class C(object): ... pass ... &gt;&gt;&gt; c = C() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(args=['--foo', 'BAR'], namespace=c) &gt;&gt;&gt; c.foo 'BAR' 15.4.5. Other utilities¶ 15.4.5.1. Sub-commands¶ ArgumentParser.add_subparsers([title][, description][, prog][, parser_class][, action][, option_string][, dest][, help][, metavar])¶ Many programs split up their functionality into a number of sub-commands, for example, the svn program can invoke sub-commands like svn checkout, svn update, and svn commit. Splitting up functionality this way can be a particularly good idea when a program performs several different functions which require different kinds of command-line arguments. ArgumentParser supports the creation of such sub-commands with the add_subparsers() method. The add_subparsers() method is normally called with no arguments and returns a special action object. This object has a single method, add_parser(), which takes a command name and any ArgumentParser constructor arguments, and returns an ArgumentParser object that can be modified as usual. Description of parameters: title - title for the sub-parser group in help output; by default “subcommands” if description is provided, otherwise uses title for positional arguments description - description for the sub-parser group in help output, by default None prog - usage information that will be displayed with sub-command help, by default the name of the program and any positional arguments before the subparser argument parser_class - class which will be used to create sub-parser instances, by default the class of the current parser (e.g. ArgumentParser) action - the basic type of action to be taken when this argument is encountered at the command line dest - name of the attribute under which sub-command name will be stored; by default None and no value is stored help - help for sub-parser group in help output, by default None metavar - string presenting available sub-commands in help; by default it is None and presents sub-commands in form {cmd1, cmd2, ..} Some example usage: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; # create the top-level parser &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='PROG') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo', action='store_true', help='foo help') &gt;&gt;&gt; subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(help='sub-command help') &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; # create the parser for the &quot;a&quot; command &gt;&gt;&gt; parser_a = subparsers.add_parser('a', help='a help') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser_a.add_argument('bar', type=int, help='bar help') &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; # create the parser for the &quot;b&quot; command &gt;&gt;&gt; parser_b = subparsers.add_parser('b', help='b help') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser_b.add_argument('--baz', choices='XYZ', help='baz help') &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; # parse some argument lists &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['a', '12']) Namespace(bar=12, foo=False) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['--foo', 'b', '--baz', 'Z']) Namespace(baz='Z', foo=True) Note that the object returned by parse_args() will only contain attributes for the main parser and the subparser that was selected by the command line (and not any other subparsers). So in the example above, when the a command is specified, only the foo and bar attributes are present, and when the b command is specified, only the foo and baz attributes are present. Similarly, when a help message is requested from a subparser, only the help for that particular parser will be printed. The help message will not include parent parser or sibling parser messages. (A help message for each subparser command, however, can be given by supplying the help= argument to add_parser() as above.) &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['--help']) usage: PROG [-h] [--foo] {a,b} ... positional arguments: {a,b} sub-command help a a help b b help optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit --foo foo help &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['a', '--help']) usage: PROG a [-h] bar positional arguments: bar bar help optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['b', '--help']) usage: PROG b [-h] [--baz {X,Y,Z}] optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit --baz {X,Y,Z} baz help The add_subparsers() method also supports title and description keyword arguments. When either is present, the subparser’s commands will appear in their own group in the help output. For example: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(title='subcommands', ... description='valid subcommands', ... help='additional help') &gt;&gt;&gt; subparsers.add_parser('foo') &gt;&gt;&gt; subparsers.add_parser('bar') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['-h']) usage: [-h] {foo,bar} ... optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit subcommands: valid subcommands {foo,bar} additional help One particularly effective way of handling sub-commands is to combine the use of the add_subparsers() method with calls to set_defaults() so that each subparser knows which Python function it should execute. For example: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; # sub-command functions &gt;&gt;&gt; def foo(args): ... print args.x * args.y ... &gt;&gt;&gt; def bar(args): ... print '((%s))' % args.z ... &gt;&gt;&gt; # create the top-level parser &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; subparsers = parser.add_subparsers() &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; # create the parser for the &quot;foo&quot; command &gt;&gt;&gt; parser_foo = subparsers.add_parser('foo') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser_foo.add_argument('-x', type=int, default=1) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser_foo.add_argument('y', type=float) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser_foo.set_defaults(func=foo) &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; # create the parser for the &quot;bar&quot; command &gt;&gt;&gt; parser_bar = subparsers.add_parser('bar') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser_bar.add_argument('z') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser_bar.set_defaults(func=bar) &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; # parse the args and call whatever function was selected &gt;&gt;&gt; args = parser.parse_args('foo 1 -x 2'.split()) &gt;&gt;&gt; args.func(args) 2.0 &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; # parse the args and call whatever function was selected &gt;&gt;&gt; args = parser.parse_args('bar XYZYX'.split()) &gt;&gt;&gt; args.func(args) ((XYZYX)) This way, you can let parse_args() do the job of calling the appropriate function after argument parsing is complete. Associating functions with actions like this is typically the easiest way to handle the different actions for each of your subparsers. However, if it is necessary to check the name of the subparser that was invoked, the dest keyword argument to the add_subparsers() call will work: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(dest='subparser_name') &gt;&gt;&gt; subparser1 = subparsers.add_parser('1') &gt;&gt;&gt; subparser1.add_argument('-x') &gt;&gt;&gt; subparser2 = subparsers.add_parser('2') &gt;&gt;&gt; subparser2.add_argument('y') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['2', 'frobble']) Namespace(subparser_name='2', y='frobble') 15.4.5.2. FileType objects¶ class argparse.FileType(mode='r', bufsize=None)¶ The FileType factory creates objects that can be passed to the type argument of ArgumentParser.add_argument(). Arguments that have FileType objects as their type will open command-line arguments as files with the requested modes and buffer sizes: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--output', type=argparse.FileType('wb', 0)) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['--output', 'out']) Namespace(output=&lt;open file 'out', mode 'wb' at 0x...&gt;) FileType objects understand the pseudo-argument '-' and automatically convert this into sys.stdin for readable FileType objects and sys.stdout for writable FileType objects: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('infile', type=argparse.FileType('r')) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['-']) Namespace(infile=&lt;open file '&lt;stdin&gt;', mode 'r' at 0x...&gt;) 15.4.5.3. Argument groups¶ ArgumentParser.add_argument_group(title=None, description=None)¶ By default, ArgumentParser groups command-line arguments into “positional arguments” and “optional arguments” when displaying help messages. When there is a better conceptual grouping of arguments than this default one, appropriate groups can be created using the add_argument_group() method: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='PROG', add_help=False) &gt;&gt;&gt; group = parser.add_argument_group('group') &gt;&gt;&gt; group.add_argument('--foo', help='foo help') &gt;&gt;&gt; group.add_argument('bar', help='bar help') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.print_help() usage: PROG [--foo FOO] bar group: bar bar help --foo FOO foo help The add_argument_group() method returns an argument group object which has an add_argument() method just like a regular ArgumentParser. When an argument is added to the group, the parser treats it just like a normal argument, but displays the argument in a separate group for help messages. The add_argument_group() method accepts title and description arguments which can be used to customize this display: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='PROG', add_help=False) &gt;&gt;&gt; group1 = parser.add_argument_group('group1', 'group1 description') &gt;&gt;&gt; group1.add_argument('foo', help='foo help') &gt;&gt;&gt; group2 = parser.add_argument_group('group2', 'group2 description') &gt;&gt;&gt; group2.add_argument('--bar', help='bar help') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.print_help() usage: PROG [--bar BAR] foo group1: group1 description foo foo help group2: group2 description --bar BAR bar help Note that any arguments not in your user-defined groups will end up back in the usual “positional arguments” and “optional arguments” sections. 15.4.5.4. Mutual exclusion¶ ArgumentParser.add_mutually_exclusive_group(required=False)¶ Create a mutually exclusive group. argparse will make sure that only one of the arguments in the mutually exclusive group was present on the command line: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='PROG') &gt;&gt;&gt; group = parser.add_mutually_exclusive_group() &gt;&gt;&gt; group.add_argument('--foo', action='store_true') &gt;&gt;&gt; group.add_argument('--bar', action='store_false') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['--foo']) Namespace(bar=True, foo=True) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['--bar']) Namespace(bar=False, foo=False) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['--foo', '--bar']) usage: PROG [-h] [--foo | --bar] PROG: error: argument --bar: not allowed with argument --foo The add_mutually_exclusive_group() method also accepts a required argument, to indicate that at least one of the mutually exclusive arguments is required: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog='PROG') &gt;&gt;&gt; group = parser.add_mutually_exclusive_group(required=True) &gt;&gt;&gt; group.add_argument('--foo', action='store_true') &gt;&gt;&gt; group.add_argument('--bar', action='store_false') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args([]) usage: PROG [-h] (--foo | --bar) PROG: error: one of the arguments --foo --bar is required Note that currently mutually exclusive argument groups do not support the title and description arguments of add_argument_group(). 15.4.5.5. Parser defaults¶ ArgumentParser.set_defaults(**kwargs)¶ Most of the time, the attributes of the object returned by parse_args() will be fully determined by inspecting the command-line arguments and the argument actions. set_defaults() allows some additional attributes that are determined without any inspection of the command line to be added: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('foo', type=int) &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.set_defaults(bar=42, baz='badger') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args(['736']) Namespace(bar=42, baz='badger', foo=736) Note that parser-level defaults always override argument-level defaults: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo', default='bar') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.set_defaults(foo='spam') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_args([]) Namespace(foo='spam') Parser-level defaults can be particularly useful when working with multiple parsers. See the add_subparsers() method for an example of this type. ArgumentParser.get_default(dest)¶ Get the default value for a namespace attribute, as set by either add_argument() or by set_defaults(): &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo', default='badger') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.get_default('foo') 'badger' 15.4.5.6. Printing help¶ In most typical applications, parse_args() will take care of formatting and printing any usage or error messages. However, several formatting methods are available: ArgumentParser.print_usage(file=None)¶ Print a brief description of how the ArgumentParser should be invoked on the command line. If file is None, sys.stdout is assumed. ArgumentParser.print_help(file=None)¶ Print a help message, including the program usage and information about the arguments registered with the ArgumentParser. If file is None, sys.stdout is assumed. There are also variants of these methods that simply return a string instead of printing it: ArgumentParser.format_usage()¶ Return a string containing a brief description of how the ArgumentParser should be invoked on the command line. ArgumentParser.format_help()¶ Return a string containing a help message, including the program usage and information about the arguments registered with the ArgumentParser. 15.4.5.7. Partial parsing¶ ArgumentParser.parse_known_args(args=None, namespace=None)¶ Sometimes a script may only parse a few of the command-line arguments, passing the remaining arguments on to another script or program. In these cases, the parse_known_args() method can be useful. It works much like parse_args() except that it does not produce an error when extra arguments are present. Instead, it returns a two item tuple containing the populated namespace and the list of remaining argument strings. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('--foo', action='store_true') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.add_argument('bar') &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.parse_known_args(['--foo', '--badger', 'BAR', 'spam']) (Namespace(bar='BAR', foo=True), ['--badger', 'spam']) Warning Prefix matching rules apply to parse_known_args(). The parser may consume an option even if it’s just a prefix of one of its known options, instead of leaving it in the remaining arguments list. 15.4.5.8. Customizing file parsing¶ ArgumentParser.convert_arg_line_to_args(arg_line)¶ Arguments that are read from a file (see the fromfile_prefix_chars keyword argument to the ArgumentParser constructor) are read one argument per line. convert_arg_line_to_args() can be overridden for fancier reading. This method takes a single argument arg_line which is a string read from the argument file. It returns a list of arguments parsed from this string. The method is called once per line read from the argument file, in order. A useful override of this method is one that treats each space-separated word as an argument: def convert_arg_line_to_args(self, arg_line): return arg_line.split() 15.4.5.9. Exiting methods¶ ArgumentParser.exit(status=0, message=None)¶ This method terminates the program, exiting with the specified status and, if given, it prints a message before that. ArgumentParser.error(message)¶ This method prints a usage message including the message to the standard error and terminates the program with a status code of 2. 15.4.6. Upgrading optparse code¶ Originally, the argparse module had attempted to maintain compatibility with optparse. However, optparse was difficult to extend transparently, particularly with the changes required to support the new nargs= specifiers and better usage messages. When most everything in optparse had either been copy-pasted over or monkey-patched, it no longer seemed practical to try to maintain the backwards compatibility. The argparse module improves on the standard library optparse module in a number of ways including: Handling positional arguments. Supporting sub-commands. Allowing alternative option prefixes like + and /. Handling zero-or-more and one-or-more style arguments. Producing more informative usage messages. Providing a much simpler interface for custom type and action. A partial upgrade path from optparse to argparse: Replace all optparse.OptionParser.add_option() calls with ArgumentParser.add_argument() calls. Replace (options, args) = parser.parse_args() with args = parser.parse_args() and add additional ArgumentParser.add_argument() calls for the positional arguments. Keep in mind that what was previously called options, now in argparse context is called args. Replace callback actions and the callback_* keyword arguments with type or action arguments. Replace string names for type keyword arguments with the corresponding type objects (e.g. int, float, complex, etc). Replace optparse.Values with Namespace and optparse.OptionError and optparse.OptionValueError with ArgumentError. Replace strings with implicit arguments such as %default or %prog with the standard Python syntax to use dictionaries to format strings, that is, %(default)s and %(prog)s. Replace the OptionParser constructor version argument with a call to parser.add_argument('--version', action='version', version='&lt;the version&gt;').

(self.embedded) submitted 11 months ago by ralphisis I am considering developing on the Yocto project for an embedded Linux project (an industrial application) and I have a few questions for those with experience with embedded Linux in general -- Yocto experience a bonus. Just need to get an idea of what is being commonly done in firmware updates. I have a few requirements, that being authentication, a secure communications protocol, some type of rollback if the update failed. Also, if there is a way to gradually release the patch across the fleet of devices then that would also be interesting as I want to avoid bricked devices in the field. How do you deploy updates/patches to field devices today – and how long did it take to develop it? Are there any other considerations I am missing? 6 comments share all 6 comments sorted by: best topnewcontroversialoldrandomq&amp;a [–]bboozzoo 2 points3 points4 points 11 months ago (4 children) I am considering developing on the Yocto project for an embedded Linux project (an industrial application) and I have a few questions for those with experience with embedded Linux in general -- Yocto experience a bonus. Just need to get an idea of what is being commonly done in firmware updates. I have a few requirements, that being authentication, a secure communications protocol, some type of rollback if the update failed. Also, if there is a way to gradually release the patch across the fleet of devices then that would also be interesting as I want to avoid bricked devices in the field. How do you deploy updates/patches to field devices today – and how long did it take to develop it? Are there any other considerations I am missing? Firmware update is very much board dependant as it pretty much involves the whole stack starting from the CPU, going through the bootloader finishing up with system glue. It also depends on what kind of memory storage you use and how trusted it is as for instance raw NAND/NOR would usually be more trusted than a eMMC/SD/CF card as far as power outage is considered. There's also the question of how much flash does the board have. I've been working on embedded Linux applications for quite some time, and almost each time we had a different, platform or application tailored solution, however, since this was mostly networking equipment (not WiFi but rather 802.16 BS/CPE or some aviation system) the requirements and the high level process view remained the same. At least 2 firmware images, update switches them in round robin fashion. Each update involved a couple of steps (so that you get a general idea): obtain candaidate firmware checksumming optional decryption identify update partition write the firmware to proper location set the update flags &amp;&amp; reboot bootloader consults the update flags, fiddles with watchdog system boots on failure (ex. panic, or some critical service keeps failing) the wachdog is allowed to reset the system, bootloader then looks at CPU reset flags to indentify the reason for reset, and switches back to the previous partition on success the update flags are cleared, so the next reset will boot the updated partition This was done using, depending on the board, either a customized RedBoot (anyone remembers this one?) or U-Boot. The boards we used all had NAND flashes so you could be fairly certain that once a thing was written it was there (unlike SD/eMMC). Rootfs was also always mounted as RO, and there was a single user configuration partiton. Firmware download was never really performed autonomusly, an operator was usually involved at some stage of the process. My current candidate for a more unified update implementation is swupdate. There's also a corresponding meta-swupdate Yocto layer. Back in June, I've sent a series of patches that Stefano Babic was kind to pull in, that extended the syntax of sw-description file so that you can perform the dual-copy update scenario. swupdate has some nice features such as integration with u-boot (the main author is a Denx employee), support for different memory device (MTD, raw like /dev/sdx) &amp; stream processing, also a really nice update description format. I'm still in progress of getting this well integrated on BeagleBone Black (rootfs &amp; uboot env on eMMC), Wandboard (only SD card) and Gateworks GW54xx (NAND flash with uboot+env &amp; ubifs paritions). Feel free to ping me on #yocto on freenode (I use the same nick as here on reddit) or just pm me here. BTW. since July 2014 uboot supports secure boot and a bit later encrypted configuration has been added, these seem like nice features for use in update process as well. permalink embed save give gold [–]ralphisis[S] 0 points1 point2 points 11 months ago (3 children) Thanks for the description and pointing me to swupdate. Do you know if there is a way to remotely deploy updates en masse rather than 1 by 1? I'm looking for a way to do this across a larger fleet, but in a controlled fashion. permalink embed save parent give gold [–]bboozzoo 1 point2 points3 points 11 months ago (2 children) I'm not aware of any ready solution for mass updates. In one project we just implmented a simple call-home mechanism to check the current version number and if needed download a complete image and run the update. In yet another one, we had both, a push notification (that's because we used a message broker for overall communication) and simple polling. Keep in mind that you still need some sort of back channel for notification about update success/failure. BTW. forgot to write that you can build package feeds with Yocto, similar to what Fedora/Ubuntu or other distributions do. Once that is made available, you can update or install individual packages. I haven't really used that as I prefer using complete firmware update images and fix only a single problem in case of failure. BTW2. there's also Ubuntu Snappy, but having played with it for a while, their OOTB board support is limited, rootfs is significantly larger than what I can obtain with Yocto (even without any special tuning) and snappy packaging policy is ridiculous (last time I checked you had to go through Ubuntu Software Store and I'm guessing patching snappy to work with your self-hosted store would break Canonical's licensing or something). permalink embed save parent give gold [–]ralphisis[S] -1 points0 points1 point 11 months ago (1 child) @bboozzoo Thanks a lot! This is really helpful. Any other distributions I should be aware of aside from Ubuntu Snappy? permalink embed save parent give gold [–]bboozzoo 1 point2 points3 points 11 months ago (0 children) Not that I'm aware of. Snappy is somewhat unique among prebuilt binary distros. The rest is just rebuilds of your usual desktop distro for ARM (and usually ony ARM). They are ok for prototyping, but I'd rather base a product on something that I'm 100% in control of, and that means Yocto or buildroot these days. Before, like 10 years back or so, I've seen people use Gentoo for embedded due to wide arch support and a lively connunity. Though I'm not sure what is the current state of this. I'm guessing these days I'd bet on Yocto as it has all the needed vendor awareness, just look ath the mailing list and see who is contirbuting the patches. It's not only Intel, but Freescale, TI, Windriver (though it's Intel at this point AFAIK), Atmel. permalink embed save parent give gold [–]albinofrenchy 1 point2 points3 points 11 months ago (0 children) A lot of this kind of thing greatly depends on your usage and your device. If you're going to add kernel modules, don't compile them into the kernel; so you can have the system init load them in. This also means you can just backup those files and copy in new ones; and on restart the updates are in place. Same basic strategy for userspace apps. You can also do updates via the boot loader. Uboot has some network capabilities I believe you might be able to use. Security here is going to be largely hand rolled if you need something stronger than ssh/Getty login. You could hit a https site on startup maybe too if the device is networked. Signed images on a usb could work too, but again that is only as secure as the time/expertise put into it. permalink embed save give gold about blog about source code advertise jobs help site rules FAQ wiki reddiquette transparency contact us apps &amp; tools Reddit for iPhone Reddit for Android mobile website buttons &lt;3 reddit gold redditgifts Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy (updated). © 2016 reddit inc.

Even the C++ people may not know such a neat C feature, the sprintf function. I use it so often in my codes and libraries thus it demands a small introduction. The following is a link to the sprintf function (I’ll be adding this link to my sample codes): http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/cstdio/sprintf/ Essentially the sprintf function takes in a few parameters, such as integers, floats etc. and then follow a format string, output a formatted string that involves the parameters. Since arduino doesn’t print float (to reduce compiled file size), you may need to print two integers for a float. Say if I want to print on LCD the current time in the following format: 13:02:00 I have three variables: int hour=13; int min=2; int sec=0; If I do the simple print, I have to do the following: lcd.print(hour); lcd.print(&quot;:&quot;); lcd.print(min); lcd.print(&quot;:&quot;); lcd.print(sec); And the result is less than perfect: 13:2:0 So how do I demand the formatting of the numbers to have a maximal 2 integer digits and no missing leading zeros? I have to tell the print function so by means of a format string. Let’s start from simple and add all details step-by-step: A format string is just a string. First I want to output integer (not float or else), so integer output is “%d”, or “%ld” for long integer. Next I want 2 digit integer so “%2d”, or “%4d” if I wanted 4 digit integer. Next I want to keep leading zero so my time looks right, so”%02d”. If I used “%2d” then leading spaces are provided so I get 13:(space)2:(space)0 Now I’m done with format string, it’s time to call the sprintf: char[9] buffer=&quot;&quot;; ///&lt; This is the buffer for the string the sprintf outputs to sprintf(buffer, &quot;%02d:%02d:%02d&quot;, hour, min, sec); ///&lt; This has 3 2-digit integers with leading zeros, separated by &quot;:&quot; . The list of parameters, hour, min, sec, provides the numbers the sprintf prints out with. lcd.print(buffer); ///&lt; You will get &quot;13:02:00&quot; This will get you: 13:02:00 From the above example you can see that you can mix regular texts such as “:” or else with the format string in a complex output. Say we want to output a count-down number like “You have XX minutes left.”, then we do: sprintf(buffer, &quot;You have %2d minutes left.&quot;, min); You always need to have a buffer char array long enough to hold the output. Count the characters before you define the length of the buffer array and add 1 to the count for string terminator. For the above string, the output is 25 characters, the “%2d” counts as 2 characters. Then you do: char [26] buffer=&quot;&quot;; It’s worth mentioning that sprintf is just for the look. There is no reason to use it if you don’t care about the look of your output. Now that you have read so much about sprintf, you may also want to know sscanf, which is the opposite. It picks out number from a complex string so if you have a string like “13:02:00”, you can extract hour, min, and sec from the string. This is especially useful when accepting parameters from serial port. If you want to know about this function, read here or reply to this post saying you are interested in a post about the sscanf. http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/cstdio/sscanf/ Share this: 1Share on Facebook (Opens in new window)1 Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to Press This!

The sprintf doesn’t understand %f since the default compiling option won’t include that for saving memory. You will get a “?”. Roy says: January 28, 2012 at 5:45 pm Liudr, Nice Post on the sprintf….if you have the time/inclination I would thoroughly enjoy short tutorial from you on the scanf as well. I find your use of examples very helpful. Reply liudr says: January 28, 2012 at 8:45 pm Roy, I’m glad that you liked the tutorial. I’ll get started with the sscanf tutorial. It’s just another very useful function to handle strings. You can send human-readable texts from PC via serial port to arduino and arduino can use sscanf to turn the texts into numbers. Reply Pingback: sscanf « Liudr's Blog michael_x says: March 24, 2012 at 1:49 pm With Arduino not caring about where variables (and const literals) reside, it’s even slightly easier to define the buffer right: char* buffer= “00:00:00″; // the content will be overritten, just to avoid wrong size counting sprintf(buffer,”%02d:%02d:%02d”,h,m,s); Reply liudr says: March 24, 2012 at 6:08 pm Good idea. Just be on the cautious side of this practice. I can recall many times I started with a smaller buffer and grew beyond its limits, leading to endless headache in debugging. Reply michael_x says: March 25, 2012 at 2:32 pm You’re right, but that’s the same with your char buffer[9]; No one stops you to strcpy(buffer, “This is too long”); Weird things will happen 😉 Try this on Arduino : int a = 0; char buffer[4]; int c = 0; void setup() { strcpy(buffer, “Hello world”); Serial.begin(9600); } void loop() { delay(2000); Serial.println(buffer); Serial.print(a); Serial.print(c); a++; c–; } The only thing to recognize always is the word “Hell” liudr says: March 25, 2012 at 2:42 pm Yeah, in old C world you are responsible of “wiping your own ass”. The C++ changed it to “all destructed asses are automatically wiped”. The memory allocation will strongly influence how your code works since you are assuming continuous memory on the variables. In a different system where data and code are stored in the same space and without protection, you will be overwriting your code with that strcpy. Virus and encryption people do that to cover their tracks from sourcers. Been a while since I used the term sourcer. liudr says: March 25, 2012 at 2:49 pm BTW, GNU C has this function that ANSI C doesn’t yet have. Check it out. int strlcpy(char *dst, const char *src, int siz) It’s safer for the ass especially when you pass strlen(buffer] as siz parameter😉 bperrybap says: May 3, 2012 at 12:27 am This is very bad practice. While it often works, it is not guaranteed to work. In fact the C standard says that the behavior of writing to a read only string is undefined. See this for some additional information about some of the issues and how to work around it by using a different declaration. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1405594/writing-into-c-string — bill Reply liudr says: May 3, 2012 at 7:12 am Good eye. I didn’t see the star. Without the star this would be fine and with the star I think verbose mode should complain that line. michael_x says: May 6, 2012 at 12:25 pm @bperrybap: &gt;This is very bad practice. You’re absolutely right. I was astonished that it compiles and works on an Arduino without warning. Replacing char* buffer= “00:00:00″; by char buffer[]= “00:00:00″; is definitely better: E.g. sizeof(buffer) gives a correct result. Thanks for your additional link.

Reply Abe says: December 9, 2014 at 10:17 am FYI: your code renders with smart quotes, so when I coppied and pasted a snippet, the double quotes were the wrong character and caused an error. Took a while to track it down, so I thought I’d mention it. But this is not a complaint–thanks for the good info! Reply liudr says: December 9, 2014 at 1:03 pm Thanks Abe. WordPress must have updated since I posted it. It’s doing the smart quote. I had to reform the code as PRE to get rid of the smart quote. Reply Abe says: December 9, 2014 at 3:04 pm Nice! That will help the next person. Thanks.

Then follow the first strand round the same path to finish at the original starting position. Celtic Knot Details Origin: Our simple example of a Celtic Knot appears to be identical to the starting layout for Ashley's Six-Stranded Platted Mat (ABOK # 2256, p 365), except that we used his starting position and followed the pattern round a second time whereas Ashley shows it as the basis for a more complicated mat. Celtic Knots: Many different patterns and designs claim to be Celtic Knots. They vary in size and complexity with shapes that include rectangles, squares, triangles and circles. We included this simple example here because one writer asked us why we had selected it as the icon for our decorative knots section but failed to show how to tie it! Additional Turns: Only two complete turns are shown in the animation and space remains between the turns. For a more pleasing appearance, one or more additional turns are added using the same technique. The entire mat is then tightened to eliminate space between the turns. Uses: Small Celtic Knot mats make excellent tablemats and hot pads. Ashley provides a huge selection of designs, some of which are very elaborate with many crossings. Some of the larger versions make useful stair treads and chair covers. Finishing the Mat: The two ends can be secured in one of several ways. When the mat is purely decorative, and the material is one that melts, the two ends can be heated in a flame and fused together. However, to do this an end has to be passed across other turns. The mat then has a thicker section and is less suitable as a tablemat. Another way to finish the mat is to attach each end to the neighboring turn using needle and thread, glue, or twine and constrictor knots. Whichever method is chosen, the junction should be concealed under another turn as demonstrated in the animation. Disclaimer: Any activity that involves ropes is potentially hazardous. Lives may be at risk - possibly your own. Considerable attention and effort have been made to ensure that these descriptions are accurate.

                   NS1:content=" ↓ Skip to Main Content armhf.com Expanding Linux Partitions: Part 2 of 2 Home Boards BeagleBone BeagleBone Black ODROID-XU Wandboard HOWTO Downloads Accessories Home › BeagleBone Black › Expanding Linux Partitions: Part 2 of 2 Expanding Linux Partitions: Part 2 of 2 Posted on May 11, 2013 by John Clark — 18 Comments ↓ As shown in Part 1 of this article, extracting Linux from a pre-made .img file can result in unused space at the end of the uSD card. Depending on the size of the uSD card, this could leave a significant amount of space left unused. This article shows how to repartition the uSD card to utilize all of the space on the uSD card. This can be done on an unmounted filesystem or even on a live filesystem. In the example below, the live filesystem of a BeagelBone Black (running the Debian Wheezy image) will be resized to take advantage of the full 4GB of space available on the uSD card used in this example. Step 1: Start fdisk To get started, list the volumes available on a BeagleBone Black that is booted from a uSD card: root@debian-armhf:/# ls -l /dev/mmcblk* brw-rw---T 1 root floppy 179, 0 Jan 1 2000 /dev/mmcblk0 brw-rw---T 1 root floppy 179, 1 Jan 1 2000 /dev/mmcblk0p1 brw-rw---T 1 root floppy 179, 2 Jan 1 2000 /dev/mmcblk0p2 brw-rw---T 1 root floppy 179, 8 Jan 1 2000 /dev/mmcblk1 brw-rw---T 1 root floppy 179, 16 Jan 1 2000 /dev/mmcblk1boot0 brw-rw---T 1 root floppy 179, 24 Jan 1 2000 /dev/mmcblk1boot1 brw-rw---T 1 root floppy 179, 9 Jan 1 2000 /dev/mmcblk1p1 brw-rw---T 1 root floppy 179, 10 Jan 1 2000 /dev/mmcblk1p2 The listing above shows an external uSD card is currently booted as indicated by the /dev/mmcblk0 entries and the lack of /dev/mmcblk0boot entries. When booted from the internal eMMC, the device with the /dev/mmcblk1boot entries would instead be at the device zero location as shown here: root@debian-armhf:/# ls -l /dev/mmcblk* brw-rw---T 1 root floppy 179, 0 Jan 1 2000 /dev/mmcblk0 brw-rw---T 1 root floppy 179, 1 Jan 1 2000 /dev/mmcblk0p1 brw-rw---T 1 root floppy 179, 16 Jan 1 2000 /dev/mmcblk0boot0 brw-rw---T 1 root floppy 179, 24 Jan 1 2000 /dev/mmcblk0boot1 brw-rw---T 1 root floppy 179, 2 Jan 1 2000 /dev/mmcblk0p2 brw-rw---T 1 root floppy 179, 8 Jan 1 2000 /dev/mmcblk1 brw-rw---T 1 root floppy 179, 9 Jan 1 2000 /dev/mmcblk1p1 brw-rw---T 1 root floppy 179, 10 Jan 1 2000 /dev/mmcblk1p2 To get started, run fdisk /dev/mmcblk0 to examine the partitioning of the external uSD card that is currently booted: root@debian-armhf:/# fdisk /dev/mmcblk0 Command (m for help): p Disk /dev/mmcblk0: 3947 MB, 3947888640 bytes 4 heads, 16 sectors/track, 120480 cylinders, total 7710720 sectors Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes Disk identifier: 0x80000000 Device Boot Start End Blocks Id System /dev/mmcblk0p1 * 2048 4095 1024 1 FAT12 /dev/mmcblk0p2 4096 3751935 1873920 83 Linux Command (m for help): Take a moment to examine what fdisk is reporting. The first line indicates that the uSD card is 3947888640 bytes in size. The 4th line reports the sector size to be 512 bytes. Some quick math shows that 3947888640 bytes / 512 bytes per sector = 7710720 sectors as is also reported on the second line. The default “block” size is 1024 bytes, but it does not actually report this unit anywhere. The Start and End columns are reporting 512 byte sectors, and the Blocks column is reporting 1024 byte blocks. The way this .img is partitioned makes the relationship easy to see in this case, but it would not be immediately apparent if this were a large hard disk and the numbers were not as magic. The starting block of the partition table at position 2048 reveals that blocks 0-2047 are not being used for user data. This amounts to a full megabyte (2048 * 512 bytes per block = 1048576 bytes), and this is the default of fdisk. The first partition is 2048 sectors in size, or 1024K, which confirms the block size being 1K. To calculate the total size of the space used on the disk, there are 2048 sectors at the head reserved for partitioning, 2048 sectors in mmcblk0p1, and 3,751,936 sectors in mmcblk0p2 for a total of 3,756,032 sectors. With each sector using 512 bytes, this totals 1,923,088,384 bytes. The choice of 1,923,088,384 bytes was used to make this image the exact size of the BeagleBone’s available eMMC space (note that 1,923,088,384 bytes / 1024^2 = 1834 MB). It is also a good size because not all external 2 GB uSD cards are exactly 2048 * 1024^2 in size. Having it a bit under 2 GB makes it a sure fit. Repartitioning the disk is rather easy since fdisk will prompt with smart default choices. The steps below will begin by deleting partition 2, then recreate it as a larger size, and finally write the new table to the disk only at the end. Notice the emphasis on the last part: No changes are actually committed to disk along the way — only by pressing ‘w’ at the end will cause changes to be written. If you make a mistake or panic, just hit ‘q’ to quit and no changes will have been made. Step 2: Delete Partition 2 Press ‘d’ for delete and ‘2’ for partition 2. Command (m for help): p Disk /dev/mmcblk0: 3947 MB, 3947888640 bytes 4 heads, 16 sectors/track, 120480 cylinders, total 7710720 sectors Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes Disk identifier: 0x80000000 Device Boot Start End Blocks Id System /dev/mmcblk0p1 * 2048 4095 1024 1 FAT12 /dev/mmcblk0p2 4096 3751935 1873920 83 Linux Command (m for help): d Partition number (1-4): 2 Command (m for help): p Disk /dev/mmcblk0: 3947 MB, 3947888640 bytes 4 heads, 16 sectors/track, 120480 cylinders, total 7710720 sectors Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes Disk identifier: 0x80000000 Device Boot Start End Blocks Id System /dev/mmcblk0p1 * 2048 4095 1024 1 FAT12 Command (m for help): Step 3: Recreate Partition 2 Press ‘n’ for new, ‘p’ for primary, and ‘2’ for partition 2. Specify start and end sectors for the new partition — just select the default values by pressing enter. In fact, outside of the the first ‘n’ they were all default choices and pressing enter alone to confirm the choice is all that is needed. Command (m for help): n Partition type: p primary (1 primary, 0 extended, 3 free) e extended Select (default p): p Partition number (1-4, default 2): 2 First sector (4096-7710719, default 4096): Using default value 4096 Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G} (4096-7710719, default 7710719): Using default value 7710719 Command (m for help): p Disk /dev/mmcblk0: 3947 MB, 3947888640 bytes 4 heads, 16 sectors/track, 120480 cylinders, total 7710720 sectors Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes Disk identifier: 0x80000000 Device Boot Start End Blocks Id System /dev/mmcblk0p1 * 2048 4095 1024 1 FAT12 /dev/mmcblk0p2 4096 7710719 3853312 83 Linux Command (m for help): That is it! Select ‘w’ to commit the changes to the uSD card. Notice that the partition table in this example was “busy” so a reboot was needed to cause the changes to be reflected. Even if it were not busy, it seems like it could be a good idea to reboot at this point if you want to be extra safe. Command (m for help): w The partition table has been altered! Calling ioctl() to re-read partition table. WARNING: Re-reading the partition table failed with error 16: Device or resource busy. The kernel still uses the old table.

The internal eMMC always has the mmcblkXboot0 and mmcblkXboot1 entries. If the device is booted from eMMC the entries will be mmcblk0boot0 and mmcblk0boot1. If the device is NOT booted from eMMC the entries will be mmcblk1boot0 and mmcblk1boot1. see more 1 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar William Miller • 3 years ago This is a great article. I was wondering how you can add a swap file to the mix? It looks like when the resize command is used, it takes all available space by default. Thanks for any help you can give. see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar armhf Mod William Miller • 3 years ago Instead of creating a swap partition, you should consider a swap file: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/l... That being said, if you do want a swap partition, don't expand to the end of the disk -- leave enough unused blocks to create a 3rd swap partition afterward. see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar Eric Nelson • 3 years ago Why is it that ARM Linux distributions insist on shipping around disk images instead of tar-balls of the filesystem? Having watched some of this develop, it seems to stem from the fact that many ARM CPUs **can** load a boot loader from SD card, and board designers choose to use this feature to save cost. We noticed it first with TI's Davinci chips, and it seems a bad idea to stuff a boot loader into un-partitioned space. Partitioning should be the job of the installer based on usage and the actual media used. see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar armhf Mod Eric Nelson • 3 years ago I don't disagree about the Linaro boot technique -- I was going to post the .tar files once an updated bootloader was available (from Boundary) that we discussed on Robert Nelson's site. I was concerned that I would not be able to adequately support the patching and flashing of my own custom u-boot. see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar Eric Nelson armhf • 3 years ago To make life easier, I just placed a set of kernel, modules, and boot script online that use our existing infrastructure for an easy, though not complete way to boot Debian or Ubuntu. http://commondatastorage.googl... If you just drop these onto a single-partition filesystem, they'll boot using 'root=/dev/mmcblk0p1' for SD boots or 'root=/dev/sda1' if booting to SATA. This is not quite as nice as booting to a RAM disk and the kernel is our latest based on 3.0.35, but this provides a gentle introduction and will be more usable because of the wider variety of peripherals supported by 3.0.35 (vs. 3.9). I tested this out against your wheezy .xz file and in worked like a champ. see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar armhf Mod Eric Nelson • 3 years ago Great news -- I'll update the Nitrogen6x section. I still seem to be struggling with the gigabit network drivers to some extent. I am running the wheezy image, and when transferring large files, I am seeing occasional stutters. When I use a gigabit USB adapter, I don't see any issues. This leads me to suspect the Linux drivers. If you still have that wheezy SD handy, could you install samba and transfer a few hundred megabytes to see if you can reproduce it? BTW -- I am empirically measuring ~800Mbit file transfers up to the Nitrogen6x with an external 2TB HDD. A very impressive board. see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar Eric Nelson armhf • 3 years ago Is this using the 3.0.35 kernel that I uploaded? I did some digging and left some comments on eewiki regarding the 3.9 kernels: http://www.eewiki.net/display/... It turns out that there are some patches from Freescale in flight to address some ethernet issues there. We did some work a while back to improve the ethernet stability in 3.0.35 as discussed here: http://boundarydevices.com/i-m... The upshot is that throughput is likely to peak at around 600 Mbits/s. We have seen full Gb transfer rates using PCIe Gb adapters, but that's a bit of work and kind of clumsy (w/daughter boards and the like). see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar Eric Nelson armhf • 3 years ago Sorry for the rant ;) see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link Load more comments Also on ARMHF BeagleBone 7 comments 3 years ago Avatar TL — Hi, I have installed Ubuntu Precise 12.04.4 LTS (June 3, 2014) into a 8GB microSD card and it works on my … BeagleBone Black 640 comments 3 years ago Avatar Sumanth Peddamatham — Hey John, I just wanted to chime in and say thanks for the amazing work.

You can concatenate Strings, append to them, search for and replace substrings, and more. It takes more memory than a simple character array, but it is also more useful. For reference, character arrays are referred to as strings with a small s, and instances of the String class are referred to as Strings with a capital S. Note that constant strings, specified in &quot;double quotes&quot; are treated as char arrays, not instances of the String class.

Week 5 Learn, Teach or Do Calligraphy in Luton Hints and Tips ← A Calligraphy Workshop at Jewels. Blowing my own trumpet. → Getting Started in Calligraphy Posted on October 26, 2011 | 11 Comments Calligraphy. Getting started. The Scribe's nightmare. The Scribe’s Nightmare. I strongly suggest that beginners read this post first and then click on Lesson One. Familiarise yourself first with the Roundhand alphabet. I am sure it will save a lot of heartache later. Firstly, there are so many products on sale, all purported to be the must have for the budding scribe. For the time being, my advice is to forget all that. Keep it simple. Buy or make only that which you need to get through the next stage in your journey. All the pens and brushes in the whole wide world are of no use if you have no idea what to do with them. If you follow the Calligradoodles videos and use the worksheets that go with them, you will notice that all the elements are made up of pencil marks on paper. So, all we need to get started, is a sheet of ordinary copy paper, a ruler and two pencils joined together with elastic bands. ( Better than tape when it comes to sharpening ). A board of some description propped at an angle of about 20 degrees on your table, or even on your knees ( Not good for the back! ), will be enough for the first few sessions. So, now you are able to construct a half decent Roundhand and Roman alphabet and are ready to progress. You will need a pen and some ink, and once again there are so many products out there that confusion can easily set in, so simplicity is best. A fountain pen set with 4 – 6 nib sizes and a good supply of cartridges or ink is a good addition to your tool-box at this point. A couple of pen holders and some broad nibs plus a bottle of black calligraphy ink ( not waterproof, this will easily clog your nib ). Here I shall make no apologies for directing you to Bill’s Art and Calligraphy Supplies I do earn a small commission from Amazon on any sales, But please don’t feel that you have to buy here. The main reason for setting up this A Shop was to illustrate the mind boggling choices we have just in this one discipline. The Book Section is mind blowing! If I can raise a few pennies to offset expenses, thanks for your custom. The Technik Art Layout Pad A/3 is a handy addition right now. Only 50 gsm means you can make one guideline sheet and lay it under each page. A good tip at this point is to rule lines at 1/8″intervals from top to bottom of that page. If you do this in landscape format it will be much more versatile. When laid under the actual working page it is easy to mark an X over 1,2,3, or however many lines it takes to make up the x height needed for the particular nib size you are using. This will stand you in good stead for the rest of your life. If you do have to draw lines, always draw them in multiples of 1/8″ according to nib size. More on this as you progress. The Brause assortment calligraphy set or William Mitchell right hand italic set. ( There are left hand versions available, and you will find a really good book for Lefthanders in the book department ). ( See also The Left-handed Calligrapher, here at Bill’s Space, and for more support and info try the Facebook group, Calligraphy for the Left Handed ) . The Manuscript Leonardt Calligraphy dip pen nibs – Italic and Poster set, is particularly good value. A bottle of black Manuscript ink or set of three, black, gold, red, W &amp; N inks will keep you busy for a while. A better quality paper is now needed to show off your new skills so a pad of Daler Rowney A/3 might be your next choice. Why A/3? Simply, this size gives more scope for layouts. If you need a smaller format, it is no problem to cut a page. For line drawing, a Rowney or any of the many boards or drawing machines available will make life a bit easier, but I find a set square running along a 2 foot ruler taped to my board is quite sufficient. Incidentally, I use a home made light -table whenever possible. If you try this, PLEASE USE ONLY TOUGHENED GLASS.There is a commercially made Artograph box in Bill’s Art and calligraphy supplies. A “T”-square is a handy addition and perhaps a few basic drawing instruments next. You see. Your collection is building up already. But only with stuff you use. Not just stuff! Scribblers have kindly issued 50 calligraphy tips You might find these useful. By the way, when conducting a workshop, I usually ask participants to bring with them the following articles if at all possible. A drawing board, approximately 18” x 24”. MDF or something similar will do, Something to prop it up to make a writing slope, i.e., a piece of wood 4” x 4” or perhaps a brick wrapped in a carrier bag. A ruler , preferably 2 foot, and a set square. A set of roundhand nibs with penholder and reservoirs. A calligraphy fountain pen is a handy addition for practice work. (Any left-handers will benefit by choosing left hand oblique nibs). Calligraphy ink. NOT WATERPROOF. Avoid Indian ink whether waterproof or not. Gouache or watercolours. Coeruleum Blue, and Vermilion. Winsor &amp; Newton Gold ink. (Optional but very handy.) 2, HB and I, 2H pencil. A 00 paint brush. A cheap brush for mixing. A palette or saucer. A jar for water and a kitchen roll. An A3 Layout pad or even a cheap sketch book. If you have some, a nice HP watercolour paper for your finished work If you have problems obtaining any commercially marketed equipment, You might try going back to basics and making your own. It is a good idea anyway to experiment with quills, reeds, bamboo, tin cans etc. My take on the Cola pen. The RED STRIPE Pen. To my mind, much more fun emptying the can. A chisel cut pencil to dip. A needlepoint and 6mm with film reservoir. Bamboo, and a 2mm Reed. Make sure mummy and daddy are supervising. Heheh. We don’t want any cut fingers! With scissors, cut top and bottom from the can, making sure you have first downed the contents. (Adults, it might be best to leave this stage ’til tomorrow, depending on the strength of the aforesaid). Carefully, (The cut tin can will be very sharp). Open up and then fold down the length of the metal. Cut whatever shape you are looking for for the nib…then continue down the length,making sure to leave enough for the handle. This is rolled and then taped tightly. Perhaps strengthening by rolling the handle round a pencil. You could make a much prettier job by soldering.Just make sure that all bare edges are covered or blunted. ‘speriment and enjoy. You might like to note that I have been experimenting with various materials to use as reservoirs. The best so far is old fashioned film or even negatives. Used flat it can be cut and pushed into a slit formed in the quill, reed, bamboo or whatever, or rolled into a spring and pushed into the aperture.

I have been a calligrapher for about 35 years (and calligraphic engraver for nine) and was approached to teach a brief class this summer to elementary students. Each class is about 45 minutes long and I’ve been told they want a demonstration followed by time for the kids to practice. Do you have any brilliant ideas? I’ve taught adults before but my challenge this time is that many of these kids have not yet mastered their OWN handwriting skills! Thank you for any light you can shed on this situation! LikeLiked by 1 person billgrant43 | June 9, 2015 at 1:37 pm | Reply 0 0 i Rate This Hi Julie. Heheh! You have found yourself in a very difficult situation. I also have been asked to do something similar for a local Guide / Brownie group but have decided that 45 minutes is just not long enough to do justice to the subject. OK if you are going to have follow up sessions but not a one off. Here is one with 15 / 16 year olds that took twice as long and was still a bit of a rush. https://calligraphybybillgrant.com/2014/05/19/a-calligraphy-workshop-at-the-red-dot-gallery/ For youngsters it might be an idea to draw out a large banner on lining paper then ask them to put on some colour. This seems always to go down very well and for some, it might just stick in the mind and bloom in the years to come. https://calligraphybybillgrant.com/2014/08/25/the-luton-fleadh-fiesta-2014/ Have fun and let me know how you get on.

More than just the insulating layer between the operating system kernel and the user, it's also a fairly powerful programming language. A shell program, called a script, is an easy-to-use tool for building applications by &quot;gluing together&quot; system calls, tools, utilities, and compiled binaries. Virtually the entire repertoire of UNIX commands, utilities, and tools is available for invocation by a shell script. If that were not enough, internal shell commands, such as testing and loop constructs, lend additional power and flexibility to scripts. Shell scripts are especially well suited for administrative system tasks and other routine repetitive tasks not requiring the bells and whistles of a full-blown tightly structured programming language. Table of Contents 1. Shell Programming! 2. Starting Off With a Sha-Bang 2.1. Invoking the script 2.2. Preliminary Exercises Chapter 1. Shell Programming! No programming language is perfect. There is not even a single best language; there are only languages well suited or perhaps poorly suited for particular purposes. --Herbert Mayer A working knowledge of shell scripting is essential to anyone wishing to become reasonably proficient at system administration, even if they do not anticipate ever having to actually write a script. Consider that as a Linux machine boots up, it executes the shell scripts in /etc/rc.d to restore the system configuration and set up services. A detailed understanding of these startup scripts is important for analyzing the behavior of a system, and possibly modifying it. The craft of scripting is not hard to master, since scripts can be built in bite-sized sections and there is only a fairly small set of shell-specific operators and options [1] to learn. The syntax is simple -- even austere -- similar to that of invoking and chaining together utilities at the command line, and there are only a few &quot;rules&quot; governing their use. Most short scripts work right the first time, and debugging even the longer ones is straightforward. In the early days of personal computing, the BASIC language enabled anyone reasonably computer proficient to write programs on an early generation of microcomputers. Decades later, the Bash scripting language enables anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of Linux or UNIX to do the same on modern machines. We now have miniaturized single-board computers with amazing capabilities, such as the Raspberry Pi. Bash scripting provides a way to explore the capabilities of these fascinating devices. A shell script is a quick-and-dirty method of prototyping a complex application. Getting even a limited subset of the functionality to work in a script is often a useful first stage in project development. In this way, the structure of the application can be tested and tinkered with, and the major pitfalls found before proceeding to the final coding in C, C++, Java, Perl, or Python. Shell scripting hearkens back to the classic UNIX philosophy of breaking complex projects into simpler subtasks, of chaining together components and utilities. Many consider this a better, or at least more esthetically pleasing approach to problem solving than using one of the new generation of high-powered all-in-one languages, such as Perl, which attempt to be all things to all people, but at the cost of forcing you to alter your thinking processes to fit the tool. According to Herbert Mayer, &quot;a useful language needs arrays, pointers, and a generic mechanism for building data structures.&quot; By these criteria, shell scripting falls somewhat short of being &quot;useful.&quot; Or, perhaps not. . . . When not to use shell scripts Resource-intensive tasks, especially where speed is a factor (sorting, hashing, recursion [2] ...) Procedures involving heavy-duty math operations, especially floating point arithmetic, arbitrary precision calculations, or complex numbers (use C++ or FORTRAN instead) Cross-platform portability required (use C or Java instead) Complex applications, where structured programming is a necessity (type-checking of variables, function prototypes, etc.) Mission-critical applications upon which you are betting the future of the company Situations where security is important, where you need to guarantee the integrity of your system and protect against intrusion, cracking, and vandalism Project consists of subcomponents with interlocking dependencies Extensive file operations required (Bash is limited to serial file access, and that only in a particularly clumsy and inefficient line-by-line fashion.) Need native support for multi-dimensional arrays Need data structures, such as linked lists or trees Need to generate / manipulate graphics or GUIs Need direct access to system hardware or external peripherals Need port or socket I/O Need to use libraries or interface with legacy code Proprietary, closed-source applications (Shell scripts put the source code right out in the open for all the world to see.) If any of the above applies, consider a more powerful scripting language -- perhaps Perl, Tcl, Python, Ruby -- or possibly a compiled language such as C, C++, or Java. Even then, prototyping the application as a shell script might still be a useful development step. We will be using Bash, an acronym [3] for &quot;Bourne-Again shell&quot; and a pun on Stephen Bourne's now classic Bourne shell. Bash has become a de facto standard for shell scripting on most flavors of UNIX. Most of the principles this book covers apply equally well to scripting with other shells, such as the Korn Shell, from which Bash derives some of its features, [4] and the C Shell and its variants. (Note that C Shell programming is not recommended due to certain inherent problems, as pointed out in an October, 1993 Usenet post by Tom Christiansen.) What follows is a tutorial on shell scripting. It relies heavily on examples to illustrate various features of the shell. The example scripts work -- they've been tested, insofar as possible -- and some of them are even useful in real life. The reader can play with the actual working code of the examples in the source archive (scriptname.sh or scriptname.bash), [5] give them execute permission (chmod u+rx scriptname), then run them to see what happens. Should the source archive not be available, then cut-and-paste from the HTML or pdf rendered versions. Be aware that some of the scripts presented here introduce features before they are explained, and this may require the reader to temporarily skip ahead for enlightenment. Unless otherwise noted, the author of this book wrote the example scripts that follow. His countenance was bold and bashed not. --Edmund Spenser Chapter 2. Starting Off With a Sha-Bang Shell programming is a 1950s juke box . . . --Larry Wall In the simplest case, a script is nothing more than a list of system commands stored in a file. At the very least, this saves the effort of retyping that particular sequence of commands each time it is invoked. Example 2-1. cleanup: A script to clean up log files in /var/log # Cleanup # Run as root, of course. cd /var/log cat /dev/null &gt; messages cat /dev/null &gt; wtmp echo &quot;Log files cleaned up.&quot; There is nothing unusual here, only a set of commands that could just as easily have been invoked one by one from the command-line on the console or in a terminal window. The advantages of placing the commands in a script go far beyond not having to retype them time and again. The script becomes a program -- a tool -- and it can easily be modified or customized for a particular application. Example 2-2. cleanup: An improved clean-up script #!/bin/bash # Proper header for a Bash script. # Cleanup, version 2 # Run as root, of course. # Insert code here to print error message and exit if not root. LOG_DIR=/var/log # Variables are better than hard-coded values. cd $LOG_DIR cat /dev/null &gt; messages cat /dev/null &gt; wtmp echo &quot;Logs cleaned up.&quot; exit # The right and proper method of &quot;exiting&quot; from a script. # A bare &quot;exit&quot; (no parameter) returns the exit status #+ of the preceding command. Now that's beginning to look like a real script. But we can go even farther . . . Example 2-3. cleanup: An enhanced and generalized version of above scripts. #!/bin/bash # Cleanup, version 3 # Warning: # ------- # This script uses quite a number of features that will be explained #+ later on. # By the time you've finished the first half of the book, #+ there should be nothing mysterious about it. LOG_DIR=/var/log ROOT_UID=0 # Only users with $UID 0 have root privileges. LINES=50 # Default number of lines saved. E_XCD=86 # Can't change directory? E_NOTROOT=87 # Non-root exit error. # Run as root, of course. if [ &quot;$UID&quot; -ne &quot;$ROOT_UID&quot; ] then echo &quot;Must be root to run this script.&quot; exit $E_NOTROOT fi if [ -n &quot;$1&quot; ] # Test whether command-line argument is present (non-empty). then lines=$1 else lines=$LINES # Default, if not specified on command-line. fi # Stephane Chazelas suggests the following, #+ as a better way of checking command-line arguments, #+ but this is still a bit advanced for this stage of the tutorial. # # E_WRONGARGS=85 # Non-numerical argument (bad argument format). # # case &quot;$1&quot; in # &quot;&quot; ) lines=50;; # *[!0-9]*) echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` lines-to-cleanup&quot;; # exit $E_WRONGARGS;; # * ) lines=$1;; # esac # #* Skip ahead to &quot;Loops&quot; chapter to decipher all this. cd $LOG_DIR if [ `pwd` != &quot;$LOG_DIR&quot; ] # or if [ &quot;$PWD&quot; != &quot;$LOG_DIR&quot; ] # Not in /var/log? then echo &quot;Can't change to $LOG_DIR.&quot; exit $E_XCD fi # Doublecheck if in right directory before messing with log file. # Far more efficient is: # # cd /var/log || { # echo &quot;Cannot change to necessary directory.&quot; &gt;&amp;2 # exit $E_XCD; # } tail -n $lines messages &gt; mesg.temp # Save last section of message log file. mv mesg.temp messages # Rename it as system log file. # cat /dev/null &gt; messages #* No longer needed, as the above method is safer. cat /dev/null &gt; wtmp # ': &gt; wtmp' and '&gt; wtmp' have the same effect. echo &quot;Log files cleaned up.&quot; # Note that there are other log files in /var/log not affected #+ by this script. exit 0 # A zero return value from the script upon exit indicates success #+ to the shell. Since you may not wish to wipe out the entire system log, this version of the script keeps the last section of the message log intact. You will constantly discover ways of fine-tuning previously written scripts for increased effectiveness. * * * The sha-bang ( #!) [6] at the head of a script tells your system that this file is a set of commands to be fed to the command interpreter indicated. The #! is actually a two-byte [7] magic number, a special marker that designates a file type, or in this case an executable shell script (type man magic for more details on this fascinating topic). Immediately following the sha-bang is a path name. This is the path to the program that interprets the commands in the script, whether it be a shell, a programming language, or a utility. This command interpreter then executes the commands in the script, starting at the top (the line following the sha-bang line), and ignoring comments. [8] #!/bin/sh #!/bin/bash #!/usr/bin/perl #!/usr/bin/tcl #!/bin/sed -f #!/bin/awk -f Each of the above script header lines calls a different command interpreter, be it /bin/sh, the default shell (bash in a Linux system) or otherwise. [9] Using #!/bin/sh, the default Bourne shell in most commercial variants of UNIX, makes the script portable to non-Linux machines, though you sacrifice Bash-specific features. The script will, however, conform to the POSIX [10] sh standard. Note that the path given at the &quot;sha-bang&quot; must be correct, otherwise an error message -- usually &quot;Command not found.&quot; -- will be the only result of running the script. [11] #! can be omitted if the script consists only of a set of generic system commands, using no internal shell directives. The second example, above, requires the initial #!, since the variable assignment line, lines=50, uses a shell-specific construct. [12] Note again that #!/bin/sh invokes the default shell interpreter, which defaults to /bin/bash on a Linux machine. Tip This tutorial encourages a modular approach to constructing a script. Make note of and collect &quot;boilerplate&quot; code snippets that might be useful in future scripts. Eventually you will build quite an extensive library of nifty routines. As an example, the following script prolog tests whether the script has been invoked with the correct number of parameters. E_WRONG_ARGS=85 script_parameters=&quot;-a -h -m -z&quot; # -a = all, -h = help, etc. if [ $# -ne $Number_of_expected_args ] then echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` $script_parameters&quot; # `basename $0` is the script's filename. exit $E_WRONG_ARGS fi Many times, you will write a script that carries out one particular task. The first script in this chapter is an example. Later, it might occur to you to generalize the script to do other, similar tasks. Replacing the literal (&quot;hard-wired&quot;) constants by variables is a step in that direction, as is replacing repetitive code blocks by functions. 2.1. Invoking the script Having written the script, you can invoke it by sh scriptname, [13] or alternatively bash scriptname. (Not recommended is using sh &lt;scriptname, since this effectively disables reading from stdin within the script.) Much more convenient is to make the script itself directly executable with a chmod. Either: chmod 555 scriptname (gives everyone read/execute permission) [14] or chmod +rx scriptname (gives everyone read/execute permission) chmod u+rx scriptname (gives only the script owner read/execute permission) Having made the script executable, you may now test it by ./scriptname. [15] If it begins with a &quot;sha-bang&quot; line, invoking the script calls the correct command interpreter to run it. As a final step, after testing and debugging, you would likely want to move it to /usr/local/bin (as root, of course), to make the script available to yourself and all other users as a systemwide executable. The script could then be invoked by simply typing scriptname [ENTER] from the command-line. 2.2. Preliminary Exercises System administrators often write scripts to automate common tasks. Give several instances where such scripts would be useful. Write a script that upon invocation shows the time and date, lists all logged-in users, and gives the system uptime. The script then saves this information to a logfile. Part 2. Basics Table of Contents 3. Special Characters 4. Introduction to Variables and Parameters 4.1. Variable Substitution 4.2.

If it has a meaning beyond its literal meaning, a meta-meaning, then we refer to it as a special character. Along with commands and keywords, special characters are building blocks of Bash scripts. Special Characters Found In Scripts and Elsewhere # Comments. Lines beginning with a # (with the exception of #!) are comments and will not be executed. # This line is a comment. Comments may also occur following the end of a command. echo &quot;A comment will follow.&quot; # Comment here. # ^ Note whitespace before # Comments may also follow whitespace at the beginning of a line. # A tab precedes this comment. Comments may even be embedded within a pipe. initial=( `cat &quot;$startfile&quot; | sed -e '/#/d' | tr -d '\n' |\ # Delete lines containing '#' comment character. sed -e 's/\./\. /g' -e 's/_/_ /g'` ) # Excerpted from life.sh script Caution A command may not follow a comment on the same line. There is no method of terminating the comment, in order for &quot;live code&quot; to begin on the same line. Use a new line for the next command. Note Of course, a quoted or an escaped # in an echo statement does not begin a comment. Likewise, a # appears in certain parameter-substitution constructs and in numerical constant expressions. echo &quot;The # here does not begin a comment.&quot; echo 'The # here does not begin a comment.' echo The \# here does not begin a comment. echo The # here begins a comment. echo ${PATH#*:} # Parameter substitution, not a comment. echo $(( 2#101011 )) # Base conversion, not a comment. # Thanks, S.C. The standard quoting and escape characters (&quot; ' \) escape the #. Certain pattern matching operations also use the #. ; Command separator [semicolon]. Permits putting two or more commands on the same line. echo hello; echo there if [ -x &quot;$filename&quot; ]; then # Note the space after the semicolon. #+ ^^ echo &quot;File $filename exists.&quot;; cp $filename $filename.bak else # ^^ echo &quot;File $filename not found.&quot;; touch $filename fi; echo &quot;File test complete.&quot; Note that the &quot;;&quot; sometimes needs to be escaped. ;; Terminator in a case option [double semicolon]. case &quot;$variable&quot; in abc) echo &quot;\$variable = abc&quot; ;; xyz) echo &quot;\$variable = xyz&quot; ;; esac ;;&amp;, ;&amp; Terminators in a case option (version 4+ of Bash). . &quot;dot&quot; command [period]. Equivalent to source (see Example 15-22). This is a bash builtin. . &quot;dot&quot;, as a component of a filename. When working with filenames, a leading dot is the prefix of a &quot;hidden&quot; file, a file that an ls will not normally show. bash$ touch .hidden-file bash$ ls -l total 10 -rw-r--r-- 1 bozo 4034 Jul 18 22:04 data1.addressbook -rw-r--r-- 1 bozo 4602 May 25 13:58 data1.addressbook.bak -rw-r--r-- 1 bozo 877 Dec 17 2000 employment.addressbook bash$ ls -al total 14 drwxrwxr-x 2 bozo bozo 1024 Aug 29 20:54 ./ drwx------ 52 bozo bozo 3072 Aug 29 20:51 ../ -rw-r--r-- 1 bozo bozo 4034 Jul 18 22:04 data1.addressbook -rw-r--r-- 1 bozo bozo 4602 May 25 13:58 data1.addressbook.bak -rw-r--r-- 1 bozo bozo 877 Dec 17 2000 employment.addressbook -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Aug 29 20:54 .hidden-file When considering directory names, a single dot represents the current working directory, and two dots denote the parent directory. bash$ pwd /home/bozo/projects bash$ cd . bash$ pwd /home/bozo/projects bash$ cd .. bash$ pwd /home/bozo/ The dot often appears as the destination (directory) of a file movement command, in this context meaning current directory. bash$ cp /home/bozo/current_work/junk/* . Copy all the &quot;junk&quot; files to $PWD. . &quot;dot&quot; character match. When matching characters, as part of a regular expression, a &quot;dot&quot; matches a single character. &quot; partial quoting [double quote]. &quot;STRING&quot; preserves (from interpretation) most of the special characters within STRING. See Chapter 5. ' full quoting [single quote]. 'STRING' preserves all special characters within STRING. This is a stronger form of quoting than &quot;STRING&quot;. See Chapter 5. , comma operator. The comma operator [16] links together a series of arithmetic operations. All are evaluated, but only the last one is returned. let &quot;t2 = ((a = 9, 15 / 3))&quot; # Set &quot;a = 9&quot; and &quot;t2 = 15 / 3&quot; The comma operator can also concatenate strings. for file in /{,usr/}bin/*calc # ^ Find all executable files ending in &quot;calc&quot; #+ in /bin and /usr/bin directories. do if [ -x &quot;$file&quot; ] then echo $file fi done # /bin/ipcalc # /usr/bin/kcalc # /usr/bin/oidcalc # /usr/bin/oocalc # Thank you, Rory Winston, for pointing this out. ,, , Lowercase conversion in parameter substitution (added in version 4 of Bash). \ escape [backslash]. A quoting mechanism for single characters. \X escapes the character X. This has the effect of &quot;quoting&quot; X, equivalent to 'X'. The \ may be used to quote &quot; and ', so they are expressed literally. See Chapter 5 for an in-depth explanation of escaped characters. / Filename path separator [forward slash]. Separates the components of a filename (as in /home/bozo/projects/Makefile). This is also the division arithmetic operator. ` command substitution. The `command` construct makes available the output of command for assignment to a variable. This is also known as backquotes or backticks. : null command [colon]. This is the shell equivalent of a &quot;NOP&quot; (no op, a do-nothing operation). It may be considered a synonym for the shell builtin true. The &quot;:&quot; command is itself a Bash builtin, and its exit status is true (0). : echo $? # 0 Endless loop: while : do operation-1 operation-2 ... operation-n done # Same as: # while true # do # ... # done Placeholder in if/then test: if condition then : # Do nothing and branch ahead else # Or else ... take-some-action fi Provide a placeholder where a binary operation is expected, see Example 8-2 and default parameters. : ${username=`whoami`} # ${username=`whoami`} Gives an error without the leading : # unless &quot;username&quot; is a command or builtin... : ${1?&quot;Usage: $0 ARGUMENT&quot;} # From &quot;usage-message.sh example script. Provide a placeholder where a command is expected in a here document. See Example 19-10. Evaluate string of variables using parameter substitution (as in Example 10-7). : ${HOSTNAME?} ${USER?} ${MAIL?} # Prints error message #+ if one or more of essential environmental variables not set. Variable expansion / substring replacement. In combination with the &gt; redirection operator, truncates a file to zero length, without changing its permissions. If the file did not previously exist, creates it. : &gt; data.xxx # File &quot;data.xxx&quot; now empty. # Same effect as cat /dev/null &gt;data.xxx # However, this does not fork a new process, since &quot;:&quot; is a builtin. See also Example 16-15. In combination with the &gt;&gt; redirection operator, has no effect on a pre-existing target file (: &gt;&gt; target_file). If the file did not previously exist, creates it. Note This applies to regular files, not pipes, symlinks, and certain special files. May be used to begin a comment line, although this is not recommended. Using # for a comment turns off error checking for the remainder of that line, so almost anything may appear in a comment. However, this is not the case with :. : This is a comment that generates an error, ( if [ $x -eq 3] ). The &quot;:&quot; serves as a field separator, in /etc/passwd, and in the $PATH variable. bash$ echo $PATH /usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/games A colon is acceptable as a function name. :() { echo &quot;The name of this function is &quot;$FUNCNAME&quot; &quot; # Why use a colon as a function name? # It's a way of obfuscating your code. } : # The name of this function is : This is not portable behavior, and therefore not a recommended practice. In fact, more recent releases of Bash do not permit this usage. An underscore _ works, though. A colon can serve as a placeholder in an otherwise empty function. not_empty () { : } # Contains a : (null command), and so is not empty. ! reverse (or negate) the sense of a test or exit status [bang]. The ! operator inverts the exit status of the command to which it is applied (see Example 6-2). It also inverts the meaning of a test operator. This can, for example, change the sense of equal ( = ) to not-equal ( != ). The ! operator is a Bash keyword. In a different context, the ! also appears in indirect variable references. In yet another context, from the command line, the ! invokes the Bash history mechanism (see Appendix L). Note that within a script, the history mechanism is disabled. * wild card [asterisk]. The * character serves as a &quot;wild card&quot; for filename expansion in globbing. By itself, it matches every filename in a given directory. bash$ echo * abs-book.sgml add-drive.sh agram.sh alias.sh The * also represents any number (or zero) characters in a regular expression. * arithmetic operator. In the context of arithmetic operations, the * denotes multiplication. ** A double asterisk can represent the exponentiation operator or extended file-match globbing. ? test operator. Within certain expressions, the ? indicates a test for a condition. In a double-parentheses construct, the ? can serve as an element of a C-style trinary operator. [17] condition?result-if-true:result-if-false (( var0 = var1&lt;98?9:21 )) # ^ ^ # if [ &quot;$var1&quot; -lt 98 ] # then # var0=9 # else # var0=21 # fi In a parameter substitution expression, the ? tests whether a variable has been set. ? wild card. The ? character serves as a single-character &quot;wild card&quot; for filename expansion in globbing, as well as representing one character in an extended regular expression. $ Variable substitution (contents of a variable). var1=5 var2=23skidoo echo $var1 # 5 echo $var2 # 23skidoo A $ prefixing a variable name indicates the value the variable holds. $ end-of-line. In a regular expression, a &quot;$&quot; addresses the end of a line of text. ${} Parameter substitution. $' ... ' Quoted string expansion. This construct expands single or multiple escaped octal or hex values into ASCII [18] or Unicode characters. $*, $@ positional parameters. $? exit status variable. The $? variable holds the exit status of a command, a function, or of the script itself. $$ process ID variable. The $$ variable holds the process ID [19] of the script in which it appears. () command group. (a=hello; echo $a) Important A listing of commands within parentheses starts a subshell. Variables inside parentheses, within the subshell, are not visible to the rest of the script. The parent process, the script, cannot read variables created in the child process, the subshell. a=123 ( a=321; ) echo &quot;a = $a&quot; # a = 123 # &quot;a&quot; within parentheses acts like a local variable. array initialization. Array=(element1 element2 element3) {xxx,yyy,zzz,...} Brace expansion. echo \&quot;{These,words,are,quoted}\&quot; # &quot; prefix and suffix # &quot;These&quot; &quot;words&quot; &quot;are&quot; &quot;quoted&quot; cat {file1,file2,file3} &gt; combined_file # Concatenates the files file1, file2, and file3 into combined_file. cp file22.{txt,backup} # Copies &quot;file22.txt&quot; to &quot;file22.backup&quot; A command may act upon a comma-separated list of file specs within braces. [20] Filename expansion (globbing) applies to the file specs between the braces. Caution No spaces allowed within the braces unless the spaces are quoted or escaped. echo {file1,file2}\ :{\ A,&quot; B&quot;,' C'} file1 : A file1 : B file1 : C file2 : A file2 : B file2 : C {a..z} Extended Brace expansion. echo {a..z} # a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z # Echoes characters between a and z. echo {0..3} # 0 1 2 3 # Echoes characters between 0 and 3. base64_charset=( {A..Z} {a..z} {0..9} + / = ) # Initializing an array, using extended brace expansion. # From vladz's &quot;base64.sh&quot; example script. The {a..z} extended brace expansion construction is a feature introduced in version 3 of Bash. {} Block of code [curly brackets]. Also referred to as an inline group, this construct, in effect, creates an anonymous function (a function without a name). However, unlike in a &quot;standard&quot; function, the variables inside a code block remain visible to the remainder of the script. bash$ { local a; a=123; } bash: local: can only be used in a function a=123 { a=321; } echo &quot;a = $a&quot; # a = 321 (value inside code block) # Thanks, S.C. The code block enclosed in braces may have I/O redirected to and from it. Example 3-1. Code blocks and I/O redirection #!/bin/bash # Reading lines in /etc/fstab. File=/etc/fstab { read line1 read line2 } &lt; $File echo &quot;First line in $File is:&quot; echo &quot;$line1&quot; echo echo &quot;Second line in $File is:&quot; echo &quot;$line2&quot; exit 0 # Now, how do you parse the separate fields of each line? # Hint: use awk, or . . . # . . . Hans-Joerg Diers suggests using the &quot;set&quot; Bash builtin. Example 3-2. Saving the output of a code block to a file #!/bin/bash # rpm-check.sh # Queries an rpm file for description, listing, #+ and whether it can be installed. # Saves output to a file. # # This script illustrates using a code block. SUCCESS=0 E_NOARGS=65 if [ -z &quot;$1&quot; ] then echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` rpm-file&quot; exit $E_NOARGS fi { # Begin code block. echo echo &quot;Archive Description:&quot; rpm -qpi $1 # Query description. echo echo &quot;Archive Listing:&quot; rpm -qpl $1 # Query listing. echo rpm -i --test $1 # Query whether rpm file can be installed. if [ &quot;$?&quot; -eq $SUCCESS ] then echo &quot;$1 can be installed.&quot; else echo &quot;$1 cannot be installed.&quot; fi echo # End code block. } &gt; &quot;$1.test&quot; # Redirects output of everything in block to file. echo &quot;Results of rpm test in file $1.test&quot; # See rpm man page for explanation of options. exit 0 Note Unlike a command group within (parentheses), as above, a code block enclosed by {braces} will not normally launch a subshell. [21] It is possible to iterate a code block using a non-standard for-loop. {} placeholder for text. Used after xargs -i (replace strings option). The {} double curly brackets are a placeholder for output text. ls . | xargs -i -t cp ./{} $1 # ^^ ^^ # From &quot;ex42.sh&quot; (copydir.sh) example. {} \; pathname. Mostly used in find constructs. This is not a shell builtin. Definition: A pathname is a filename that includes the complete path. As an example, /home/bozo/Notes/Thursday/schedule.txt. This is sometimes referred to as the absolute path. Note The &quot;;&quot; ends the -exec option of a find command sequence. It needs to be escaped to protect it from interpretation by the shell. [ ] test. Test expression between [ ]. Note that [ is part of the shell builtin test (and a synonym for it), not a link to the external command /usr/bin/test. [[ ]] test. Test expression between [[ ]]. More flexible than the single-bracket [ ] test, this is a shell keyword. See the discussion on the [[ ... ]] construct. [ ] array element. In the context of an array, brackets set off the numbering of each element of that array. Array[1]=slot_1 echo ${Array[1]} [ ] range of characters. As part of a regular expression, brackets delineate a range of characters to match. $[ ... ] integer expansion. Evaluate integer expression between $[ ]. a=3 b=7 echo $[$a+$b] # 10 echo $[$a*$b] # 21 Note that this usage is deprecated, and has been replaced by the (( ... )) construct. (( )) integer expansion. Expand and evaluate integer expression between (( )). See the discussion on the (( ... )) construct. &gt; &amp;&gt; &gt;&amp; &gt;&gt; &lt; &lt;&gt; redirection. scriptname &gt;filename redirects the output of scriptname to file filename. Overwrite filename if it already exists. command &amp;&gt;filename redirects both the stdout and the stderr of command to filename. Note This is useful for suppressing output when testing for a condition. For example, let us test whether a certain command exists. bash$ type bogus_command &amp;&gt;/dev/null bash$ echo $? 1 Or in a script: command_test () { type &quot;$1&quot; &amp;&gt;/dev/null; } # ^ cmd=rmdir # Legitimate command. command_test $cmd; echo $? # 0 cmd=bogus_command # Illegitimate command command_test $cmd; echo $? # 1 command &gt;&amp;2 redirects stdout of command to stderr. scriptname &gt;&gt;filename appends the output of scriptname to file filename. If filename does not already exist, it is created. [i]&lt;&gt;filename opens file filename for reading and writing, and assigns file descriptor i to it. If filename does not exist, it is created. process substitution. (command)&gt; &lt;(command) In a different context, the &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot; characters act as string comparison operators. In yet another context, the &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot; characters act as integer comparison operators. See also Example 16-9. &lt;&lt; redirection used in a here document. &lt;&lt;&lt; redirection used in a here string. &lt;, &gt; ASCII comparison. veg1=carrots veg2=tomatoes if [[ &quot;$veg1&quot; &lt; &quot;$veg2&quot; ]] then echo &quot;Although $veg1 precede $veg2 in the dictionary,&quot; echo -n &quot;this does not necessarily imply anything &quot; echo &quot;about my culinary preferences.&quot; else echo &quot;What kind of dictionary are you using, anyhow?&quot; fi \&lt;, \&gt; word boundary in a regular expression. bash$ grep '\&lt;the\&gt;' textfile | pipe. Passes the output (stdout) of a previous command to the input (stdin) of the next one, or to the shell. This is a method of chaining commands together. echo ls -l | sh # Passes the output of &quot;echo ls -l&quot; to the shell, #+ with the same result as a simple &quot;ls -l&quot;. cat *.lst | sort | uniq # Merges and sorts all &quot;.lst&quot; files, then deletes duplicate lines. A pipe, as a classic method of interprocess communication, sends the stdout of one process to the stdin of another. In a typical case, a command, such as cat or echo, pipes a stream of data to a filter, a command that transforms its input for processing. [22] cat $filename1 $filename2 | grep $search_word For an interesting note on the complexity of using UNIX pipes, see the UNIX FAQ, Part 3. The output of a command or commands may be piped to a script. #!/bin/bash # uppercase.sh : Changes input to uppercase. tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' # Letter ranges must be quoted #+ to prevent filename generation from single-letter filenames. exit 0 Now, let us pipe the output of ls -l to this script. bash$ ls -l | ./uppercase.sh -RW-RW-R-- 1 BOZO BOZO 109 APR 7 19:49 1.TXT -RW-RW-R-- 1 BOZO BOZO 109 APR 14 16:48 2.TXT -RW-R--R-- 1 BOZO BOZO 725 APR 20 20:56 DATA-FILE Note The stdout of each process in a pipe must be read as the stdin of the next. If this is not the case, the data stream will block, and the pipe will not behave as expected. cat file1 file2 | ls -l | sort # The output from &quot;cat file1 file2&quot; disappears. A pipe runs as a child process, and therefore cannot alter script variables. variable=&quot;initial_value&quot; echo &quot;new_value&quot; | read variable echo &quot;variable = $variable&quot; # variable = initial_value If one of the commands in the pipe aborts, this prematurely terminates execution of the pipe. Called a broken pipe, this condition sends a SIGPIPE signal. &gt;| force redirection (even if the noclobber option is set). This will forcibly overwrite an existing file. || OR logical operator. In a test construct, the || operator causes a return of 0 (success) if either of the linked test conditions is true. &amp; Run job in background. A command followed by an &amp; will run in the background. bash$ sleep 10 &amp; [1] 850 [1]+ Done sleep 10 Within a script, commands and even loops may run in the background. Example 3-3. Running a loop in the background #!/bin/bash # background-loop.sh for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 # First loop. do echo -n &quot;$i &quot; done &amp; # Run this loop in background. # Will sometimes execute after second loop. echo # This 'echo' sometimes will not display. for i in 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 # Second loop. do echo -n &quot;$i &quot; done echo # This 'echo' sometimes will not display. # ====================================================== # The expected output from the script: # 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 # 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 # Sometimes, though, you get: # 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 # 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 bozo $ # (The second 'echo' doesn't execute. Why?) # Occasionally also: # 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 # (The first 'echo' doesn't execute. Why?) # Very rarely something like: # 11 12 13 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 # The foreground loop preempts the background one. exit 0 # Nasimuddin Ansari suggests adding sleep 1 #+ after the echo -n &quot;$i&quot; in lines 6 and 14, #+ for some real fun. Caution A command run in the background within a script may cause the script to hang, waiting for a keystroke. Fortunately, there is a remedy for this. &amp;&amp; AND logical operator. In a test construct, the &amp;&amp; operator causes a return of 0 (success) only if both the linked test conditions are true. - option, prefix. Option flag for a command or filter. Prefix for an operator. Prefix for a default parameter in parameter substitution. COMMAND -[Option1][Option2][...] ls -al sort -dfu $filename if [ $file1 -ot $file2 ] then # ^ echo &quot;File $file1 is older than $file2.&quot; fi if [ &quot;$a&quot; -eq &quot;$b&quot; ] then # ^ echo &quot;$a is equal to $b.&quot; fi if [ &quot;$c&quot; -eq 24 -a &quot;$d&quot; -eq 47 ] then # ^ ^ echo &quot;$c equals 24 and $d equals 47.&quot; fi param2=${param1:-$DEFAULTVAL} # ^ -- The double-dash -- prefixes long (verbatim) options to commands. sort --ignore-leading-blanks Used with a Bash builtin, it means the end of options to that particular command.

Note that in this context the &quot;-&quot; is not itself a Bash operator, but rather an option recognized by certain UNIX utilities that write to stdout, such as tar, cat, etc. bash$ echo &quot;whatever&quot; | cat - whatever Where a filename is expected, - redirects output to stdout (sometimes seen with tar cf), or accepts input from stdin, rather than from a file. This is a method of using a file-oriented utility as a filter in a pipe. bash$ file Usage: file [-bciknvzL] [-f namefile] [-m magicfiles] file... By itself on the command-line, file fails with an error message. Add a &quot;-&quot; for a more useful result. This causes the shell to await user input. bash$ file - abc standard input: ASCII text bash$ file - #!/bin/bash standard input: Bourne-Again shell script text executable Now the command accepts input from stdin and analyzes it. The &quot;-&quot; can be used to pipe stdout to other commands. This permits such stunts as prepending lines to a file. Using diff to compare a file with a section of another: grep Linux file1 | diff file2 - Finally, a real-world example using - with tar. Example 3-4.

BACKUPFILE=backup-$(date +%m-%d-%Y) # Embeds date in backup filename. # Thanks, Joshua Tschida, for the idea. archive=${1:-$BACKUPFILE} # If no backup-archive filename specified on command-line, #+ it will default to &quot;backup-MM-DD-YYYY.tar.gz.&quot; tar cvf - `find . -mtime -1 -type f -print` &gt; $archive.tar gzip $archive.tar echo &quot;Directory $PWD backed up in archive file \&quot;$archive.tar.gz\&quot;.&quot; # Stephane Chazelas points out that the above code will fail #+ if there are too many files found #+ or if any filenames contain blank characters. # He suggests the following alternatives: # ------------------------------------------------------------------- # find . -mtime -1 -type f -print0 | xargs -0 tar rvf &quot;$archive.tar&quot; # using the GNU version of &quot;find&quot;. # find . -mtime -1 -type f -exec tar rvf &quot;$archive.tar&quot; '{}' \; # portable to other UNIX flavors, but much slower. # ------------------------------------------------------------------- exit 0 Caution Filenames beginning with &quot;-&quot; may cause problems when coupled with the &quot;-&quot; redirection operator. A script should check for this and add an appropriate prefix to such filenames, for example ./-FILENAME, $PWD/-FILENAME, or $PATHNAME/-FILENAME. If the value of a variable begins with a -, this may likewise create problems. var=&quot;-n&quot; echo $var # Has the effect of &quot;echo -n&quot;, and outputs nothing. - previous working directory. A cd - command changes to the previous working directory. This uses the $OLDPWD environmental variable. Caution Do not confuse the &quot;-&quot; used in this sense with the &quot;-&quot; redirection operator just discussed. The interpretation of the &quot;-&quot; depends on the context in which it appears. - Minus. Minus sign in an arithmetic operation. = Equals. Assignment operator a=28 echo $a # 28 In a different context, the &quot;=&quot; is a string comparison operator. + Plus. Addition arithmetic operator. In a different context, the + is a Regular Expression operator. + Option. Option flag for a command or filter. Certain commands and builtins use the + to enable certain options and the - to disable them. In parameter substitution, the + prefixes an alternate value that a variable expands to. % modulo. Modulo (remainder of a division) arithmetic operation. let &quot;z = 5 % 3&quot; echo $z # 2 In a different context, the % is a pattern matching operator. ~ home directory [tilde]. This corresponds to the $HOME internal variable. ~bozo is bozo's home directory, and ls ~bozo lists the contents of it. ~/ is the current user's home directory, and ls ~/ lists the contents of it. bash$ echo ~bozo /home/bozo bash$ echo ~ /home/bozo bash$ echo ~/ /home/bozo/ bash$ echo ~: /home/bozo: bash$ echo ~nonexistent-user ~nonexistent-user ~+ current working directory. This corresponds to the $PWD internal variable. ~- previous working directory. This corresponds to the $OLDPWD internal variable. =~ regular expression match. This operator was introduced with version 3 of Bash. ^ beginning-of-line. In a regular expression, a &quot;^&quot; addresses the beginning of a line of text. ^, ^^ Uppercase conversion in parameter substitution (added in version 4 of Bash). Control Characters change the behavior of the terminal or text display. A control character is a CONTROL + key combination (pressed simultaneously). A control character may also be written in octal or hexadecimal notation, following an escape. Control characters are not normally useful inside a script. Ctl-A Moves cursor to beginning of line of text (on the command-line). Ctl-B Backspace (nondestructive). Ctl-C Break. Terminate a foreground job. Ctl-D Log out from a shell (similar to exit). EOF (end-of-file). This also terminates input from stdin. When typing text on the console or in an xterm window, Ctl-D erases the character under the cursor. When there are no characters present, Ctl-D logs out of the session, as expected. In an xterm window, this has the effect of closing the window. Ctl-E Moves cursor to end of line of text (on the command-line). Ctl-F Moves cursor forward one character position (on the command-line). Ctl-G BEL. On some old-time teletype terminals, this would actually ring a bell. In an xterm it might beep. Ctl-H Rubout (destructive backspace). Erases characters the cursor backs over while backspacing. #!/bin/bash # Embedding Ctl-H in a string. a=&quot;^H^H&quot; # Two Ctl-H's -- backspaces # ctl-V ctl-H, using vi/vim echo &quot;abcdef&quot; # abcdef echo echo -n &quot;abcdef$a &quot; # abcd f # Space at end ^ ^ Backspaces twice. echo echo -n &quot;abcdef$a&quot; # abcdef # No space at end ^ Doesn't backspace (why?). # Results may not be quite as expected. echo; echo # Constantin Hagemeier suggests trying: # a=$'\010\010' # a=$'\b\b' # a=$'\x08\x08' # But, this does not change the results. ######################################## # Now, try this. rubout=&quot;^H^H^H^H^H&quot; # 5 x Ctl-H. echo -n &quot;12345678&quot; sleep 2 echo -n &quot;$rubout&quot; sleep 2 Ctl-I Horizontal tab. Ctl-J Newline (line feed). In a script, may also be expressed in octal notation -- '\012' or in hexadecimal -- '\x0a'. Ctl-K Vertical tab. When typing text on the console or in an xterm window, Ctl-K erases from the character under the cursor to end of line. Within a script, Ctl-K may behave differently, as in Lee Lee Maschmeyer's example, below. Ctl-L Formfeed (clear the terminal screen). In a terminal, this has the same effect as the clear command. When sent to a printer, a Ctl-L causes an advance to end of the paper sheet. Ctl-M Carriage return. #!/bin/bash # Thank you, Lee Maschmeyer, for this example. read -n 1 -s -p \ $'Control-M leaves cursor at beginning of this line. Press Enter. \x0d' # Of course, '0d' is the hex equivalent of Control-M. echo &gt;&amp;2 # The '-s' makes anything typed silent, #+ so it is necessary to go to new line explicitly. read -n 1 -s -p $'Control-J leaves cursor on next line. \x0a' # '0a' is the hex equivalent of Control-J, linefeed. echo &gt;&amp;2 ### read -n 1 -s -p $'And Control-K\x0bgoes straight down.' echo &gt;&amp;2 # Control-K is vertical tab. # A better example of the effect of a vertical tab is: var=$'\x0aThis is the bottom line\x0bThis is the top line\x0a' echo &quot;$var&quot; # This works the same way as the above example. However: echo &quot;$var&quot; | col # This causes the right end of the line to be higher than the left end. # It also explains why we started and ended with a line feed -- #+ to avoid a garbled screen. # As Lee Maschmeyer explains: # -------------------------- # In the [first vertical tab example] . . . the vertical tab #+ makes the printing go straight down without a carriage return. # This is true only on devices, such as the Linux console, #+ that can't go &quot;backward.&quot; # The real purpose of VT is to go straight UP, not down. # It can be used to print superscripts on a printer. # The col utility can be used to emulate the proper behavior of VT. exit 0 Ctl-N Erases a line of text recalled from history buffer [23] (on the command-line). Ctl-O Issues a newline (on the command-line). Ctl-P Recalls last command from history buffer (on the command-line). Ctl-Q Resume (XON). This resumes stdin in a terminal. Ctl-R Backwards search for text in history buffer (on the command-line). Ctl-S Suspend (XOFF). This freezes stdin in a terminal. (Use Ctl-Q to restore input.) Ctl-T Reverses the position of the character the cursor is on with the previous character (on the command-line). Ctl-U Erase a line of input, from the cursor backward to beginning of line. In some settings, Ctl-U erases the entire line of input, regardless of cursor position. Ctl-V When inputting text, Ctl-V permits inserting control characters. For example, the following two are equivalent: echo -e '\x0a' echo &lt;Ctl-V&gt;&lt;Ctl-J&gt; Ctl-V is primarily useful from within a text editor. Ctl-W When typing text on the console or in an xterm window, Ctl-W erases from the character under the cursor backwards to the first instance of whitespace. In some settings, Ctl-W erases backwards to first non-alphanumeric character. Ctl-X In certain word processing programs, Cuts highlighted text and copies to clipboard. Ctl-Y Pastes back text previously erased (with Ctl-U or Ctl-W). Ctl-Z Pauses a foreground job. Substitute operation in certain word processing applications. EOF (end-of-file) character in the MSDOS filesystem. Whitespace functions as a separator between commands and/or variables. Whitespace consists of either spaces, tabs, blank lines, or any combination thereof. [24] In some contexts, such as variable assignment, whitespace is not permitted, and results in a syntax error. Blank lines have no effect on the action of a script, and are therefore useful for visually separating functional sections. $IFS, the special variable separating fields of input to certain commands. It defaults to whitespace. Definition: A field is a discrete chunk of data expressed as a string of consecutive characters. Separating each field from adjacent fields is either whitespace or some other designated character (often determined by the $IFS). In some contexts, a field may be called a record. To preserve whitespace within a string or in a variable, use quoting. UNIX filters can target and operate on whitespace using the POSIX character class [:space:]. Chapter 4. Introduction to Variables and Parameters Variables are how programming and scripting languages represent data. A variable is nothing more than a label, a name assigned to a location or set of locations in computer memory holding an item of data. Variables appear in arithmetic operations and manipulation of quantities, and in string parsing. 4.1. Variable Substitution The name of a variable is a placeholder for its value, the data it holds. Referencing (retrieving) its value is called variable substitution. $ Let us carefully distinguish between the name of a variable and its value. If variable1 is the name of a variable, then $variable1 is a reference to its value, the data item it contains. [25] bash$ variable1=23 bash$ echo variable1 variable1 bash$ echo $variable1 23 The only times a variable appears &quot;naked&quot; -- without the $ prefix -- is when declared or assigned, when unset, when exported, in an arithmetic expression within double parentheses (( ... )), or in the special case of a variable representing a signal (see Example 32-5). Assignment may be with an = (as in var1=27), in a read statement, and at the head of a loop (for var2 in 1 2 3). Enclosing a referenced value in double quotes (&quot; ... &quot;) does not interfere with variable substitution. This is called partial quoting, sometimes referred to as &quot;weak quoting.&quot; Using single quotes (' ... ') causes the variable name to be used literally, and no substitution will take place. This is full quoting, sometimes referred to as 'strong quoting.' See Chapter 5 for a detailed discussion. Note that $variable is actually a simplified form of ${variable}. In contexts where the $variable syntax causes an error, the longer form may work (see Section 10.2, below). Example 4-1. Variable assignment and substitution #!/bin/bash # ex9.sh # Variables: assignment and substitution a=375 hello=$a # ^ ^ #------------------------------------------------------------------------- # No space permitted on either side of = sign when initializing variables. # What happens if there is a space? # &quot;VARIABLE =value&quot; # ^ #% Script tries to run &quot;VARIABLE&quot; command with one argument, &quot;=value&quot;. # &quot;VARIABLE= value&quot; # ^ #% Script tries to run &quot;value&quot; command with #+ the environmental variable &quot;VARIABLE&quot; set to &quot;&quot;. #------------------------------------------------------------------------- echo hello # hello # Not a variable reference, just the string &quot;hello&quot; ... echo $hello # 375 # ^ This *is* a variable reference. echo ${hello} # 375 # Likewise a variable reference, as above. # Quoting . . . echo &quot;$hello&quot; # 375 echo &quot;${hello}&quot; # 375 echo hello=&quot;A B C D&quot; echo $hello # A B C D echo &quot;$hello&quot; # A B C D # As we see, echo $hello and echo &quot;$hello&quot; give different results. # ======================================= # Quoting a variable preserves whitespace. # ======================================= echo echo '$hello' # $hello # ^ ^ # Variable referencing disabled (escaped) by single quotes, #+ which causes the &quot;$&quot; to be interpreted literally. # Notice the effect of different types of quoting. hello= # Setting it to a null value. echo &quot;\$hello (null value) = $hello&quot; # $hello (null value) = # Note that setting a variable to a null value is not the same as #+ unsetting it, although the end result is the same (see below). # -------------------------------------------------------------- # It is permissible to set multiple variables on the same line, #+ if separated by white space. # Caution, this may reduce legibility, and may not be portable. var1=21 var2=22 var3=$V3 echo echo &quot;var1=$var1 var2=$var2 var3=$var3&quot; # May cause problems with legacy versions of &quot;sh&quot; . . . # -------------------------------------------------------------- echo; echo numbers=&quot;one two three&quot; # ^ ^ other_numbers=&quot;1 2 3&quot; # ^ ^ # If there is whitespace embedded within a variable, #+ then quotes are necessary. # other_numbers=1 2 3 # Gives an error message. echo &quot;numbers = $numbers&quot; echo &quot;other_numbers = $other_numbers&quot; # other_numbers = 1 2 3 # Escaping the whitespace also works. mixed_bag=2\ ---\ Whatever # ^ ^ Space after escape (\). echo &quot;$mixed_bag&quot; # 2 --- Whatever echo; echo echo &quot;uninitialized_variable = $uninitialized_variable&quot; # Uninitialized variable has null value (no value at all!). uninitialized_variable= # Declaring, but not initializing it -- #+ same as setting it to a null value, as above. echo &quot;uninitialized_variable = $uninitialized_variable&quot; # It still has a null value. uninitialized_variable=23 # Set it. unset uninitialized_variable # Unset it. echo &quot;uninitialized_variable = $uninitialized_variable&quot; # uninitialized_variable = # It still has a null value. echo exit 0 Caution An uninitialized variable has a &quot;null&quot; value -- no assigned value at all (not zero!). if [ -z &quot;$unassigned&quot; ] then echo &quot;\$unassigned is NULL.&quot; fi # $unassigned is NULL. Using a variable before assigning a value to it may cause problems. It is nevertheless possible to perform arithmetic operations on an uninitialized variable. echo &quot;$uninitialized&quot; # (blank line) let &quot;uninitialized += 5&quot; # Add 5 to it. echo &quot;$uninitialized&quot; # 5 # Conclusion: # An uninitialized variable has no value, #+ however it evaluates as 0 in an arithmetic operation. See also Example 15-23. 4.2. Variable Assignment = the assignment operator (no space before and after) Caution Do not confuse this with = and -eq, which test, rather than assign! Note that = can be either an assignment or a test operator, depending on context. Example 4-2. Plain Variable Assignment #!/bin/bash # Naked variables echo # When is a variable &quot;naked&quot;, i.e., lacking the '$' in front? # When it is being assigned, rather than referenced. # Assignment a=879 echo &quot;The value of \&quot;a\&quot; is $a.&quot; # Assignment using 'let' let a=16+5 echo &quot;The value of \&quot;a\&quot; is now $a.&quot; echo # In a 'for' loop (really, a type of disguised assignment): echo -n &quot;Values of \&quot;a\&quot; in the loop are: &quot; for a in 7 8 9 11 do echo -n &quot;$a &quot; done echo echo # In a 'read' statement (also a type of assignment): echo -n &quot;Enter \&quot;a\&quot; &quot; read a echo &quot;The value of \&quot;a\&quot; is now $a.&quot; echo exit 0 Example 4-3. Variable Assignment, plain and fancy #!/bin/bash a=23 # Simple case echo $a b=$a echo $b # Now, getting a little bit fancier (command substitution). a=`echo Hello!` # Assigns result of 'echo' command to 'a' ... echo $a # Note that including an exclamation mark (!) within a #+ command substitution construct will not work from the command-line, #+ since this triggers the Bash &quot;history mechanism.&quot; # Inside a script, however, the history functions are disabled by default. a=`ls -l` # Assigns result of 'ls -l' command to 'a' echo $a # Unquoted, however, it removes tabs and newlines. echo echo &quot;$a&quot; # The quoted variable preserves whitespace. # (See the chapter on &quot;Quoting.&quot;) exit 0 Variable assignment using the $(...) mechanism (a newer method than backquotes). This is likewise a form of command substitution. # From /etc/rc.d/rc.local R=$(cat /etc/redhat-release) arch=$(uname -m) 4.3. Bash Variables Are Untyped Unlike many other programming languages, Bash does not segregate its variables by &quot;type.&quot; Essentially, Bash variables are character strings, but, depending on context, Bash permits arithmetic operations and comparisons on variables. The determining factor is whether the value of a variable contains only digits. Example 4-4. Integer or string? #!/bin/bash # int-or-string.sh a=2334 # Integer. let &quot;a += 1&quot; echo &quot;a = $a &quot; # a = 2335 echo # Integer, still. b=${a/23/BB} # Substitute &quot;BB&quot; for &quot;23&quot;. # This transforms $b into a string. echo &quot;b = $b&quot; # b = BB35 declare -i b # Declaring it an integer doesn't help. echo &quot;b = $b&quot; # b = BB35 let &quot;b += 1&quot; # BB35 + 1 echo &quot;b = $b&quot; # b = 1 echo # Bash sets the &quot;integer value&quot; of a string to 0. c=BB34 echo &quot;c = $c&quot; # c = BB34 d=${c/BB/23} # Substitute &quot;23&quot; for &quot;BB&quot;. # This makes $d an integer. echo &quot;d = $d&quot; # d = 2334 let &quot;d += 1&quot; # 2334 + 1 echo &quot;d = $d&quot; # d = 2335 echo # What about null variables? e='' # ... Or e=&quot;&quot; ... Or e= echo &quot;e = $e&quot; # e = let &quot;e += 1&quot; # Arithmetic operations allowed on a null variable? echo &quot;e = $e&quot; # e = 1 echo # Null variable transformed into an integer. # What about undeclared variables? echo &quot;f = $f&quot; # f = let &quot;f += 1&quot; # Arithmetic operations allowed? echo &quot;f = $f&quot; # f = 1 echo # Undeclared variable transformed into an integer. # # However ... let &quot;f /= $undecl_var&quot; # Divide by zero? # let: f /= : syntax error: operand expected (error token is &quot; &quot;) # Syntax error! Variable $undecl_var is not set to zero here! # # But still ... let &quot;f /= 0&quot; # let: f /= 0: division by 0 (error token is &quot;0&quot;) # Expected behavior. # Bash (usually) sets the &quot;integer value&quot; of null to zero #+ when performing an arithmetic operation. # But, don't try this at home, folks! # It's undocumented and probably non-portable behavior. # Conclusion: Variables in Bash are untyped, #+ with all attendant consequences. exit $? Untyped variables are both a blessing and a curse. They permit more flexibility in scripting and make it easier to grind out lines of code (and give you enough rope to hang yourself!). However, they likewise permit subtle errors to creep in and encourage sloppy programming habits. To lighten the burden of keeping track of variable types in a script, Bash does permit declaring variables. 4.4. Special Variable Types Local variables Variables visible only within a code block or function (see also local variables in functions) Environmental variables Variables that affect the behavior of the shell and user interface Note In a more general context, each process has an &quot;environment&quot;, that is, a group of variables that the process may reference. In this sense, the shell behaves like any other process. Every time a shell starts, it creates shell variables that correspond to its own environmental variables. Updating or adding new environmental variables causes the shell to update its environment, and all the shell's child processes (the commands it executes) inherit this environment. Caution The space allotted to the environment is limited. Creating too many environmental variables or ones that use up excessive space may cause problems. bash$ eval &quot;`seq 10000 | sed -e 's/.*/export var&amp;=ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ/'`&quot; bash$ du bash: /usr/bin/du: Argument list too long Note: this &quot;error&quot; has been fixed, as of kernel version 2.6.23. (Thank you, Stéphane Chazelas for the clarification, and for providing the above example.) If a script sets environmental variables, they need to be &quot;exported,&quot; that is, reported to the environment local to the script. This is the function of the export command. Note A script can export variables only to child processes, that is, only to commands or processes which that particular script initiates. A script invoked from the command-line cannot export variables back to the command-line environment. Child processes cannot export variables back to the parent processes that spawned them. Definition: A child process is a subprocess launched by another process, its parent. Positional parameters Arguments passed to the script from the command line [26] : $0, $1, $2, $3 . . . $0 is the name of the script itself, $1 is the first argument, $2 the second, $3 the third, and so forth. [27] After $9, the arguments must be enclosed in brackets, for example, ${10}, ${11}, ${12}. The special variables $* and $@ denote all the positional parameters. Example 4-5. Positional Parameters #!/bin/bash # Call this script with at least 10 parameters, for example # ./scriptname 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 MINPARAMS=10 echo echo &quot;The name of this script is \&quot;$0\&quot;.&quot; # Adds ./ for current directory echo &quot;The name of this script is \&quot;`basename $0`\&quot;.&quot; # Strips out path name info (see 'basename') echo if [ -n &quot;$1&quot; ] # Tested variable is quoted. then echo &quot;Parameter #1 is $1&quot; # Need quotes to escape # fi if [ -n &quot;$2&quot; ] then echo &quot;Parameter #2 is $2&quot; fi if [ -n &quot;$3&quot; ] then echo &quot;Parameter #3 is $3&quot; fi # ... if [ -n &quot;${10}&quot; ] # Parameters &gt; $9 must be enclosed in {brackets}. then echo &quot;Parameter #10 is ${10}&quot; fi echo &quot;-----------------------------------&quot; echo &quot;All the command-line parameters are: &quot;$*&quot;&quot; if [ $# -lt &quot;$MINPARAMS&quot; ] then echo echo &quot;This script needs at least $MINPARAMS command-line arguments!&quot; fi echo exit 0 Bracket notation for positional parameters leads to a fairly simple way of referencing the last argument passed to a script on the command-line. This also requires indirect referencing. args=$# # Number of args passed. lastarg=${!args} # Note: This is an *indirect reference* to $args ... # Or: lastarg=${!#} (Thanks, Chris Monson.) # This is an *indirect reference* to the $# variable. # Note that lastarg=${!$#} doesn't work. Some scripts can perform different operations, depending on which name they are invoked with. For this to work, the script needs to check $0, the name it was invoked by. [28] There must also exist symbolic links to all the alternate names of the script. See Example 16-2. Tip If a script expects a command-line parameter but is invoked without one, this may cause a null variable assignment, generally an undesirable result. One way to prevent this is to append an extra character to both sides of the assignment statement using the expected positional parameter. variable1_=$1_ # Rather than variable1=$1 # This will prevent an error, even if positional parameter is absent. critical_argument01=$variable1_ # The extra character can be stripped off later, like so. variable1=${variable1_/_/} # Side effects only if $variable1_ begins with an underscore. # This uses one of the parameter substitution templates discussed later. # (Leaving out the replacement pattern results in a deletion.) # A more straightforward way of dealing with this is #+ to simply test whether expected positional parameters have been passed. if [ -z $1 ] then exit $E_MISSING_POS_PARAM fi # However, as Fabian Kreutz points out, #+ the above method may have unexpected side-effects. # A better method is parameter substitution: # ${1:-$DefaultVal} # See the &quot;Parameter Substition&quot; section #+ in the &quot;Variables Revisited&quot; chapter. --- Example 4-6. wh, whois domain name lookup #!/bin/bash # ex18.sh # Does a 'whois domain-name' lookup on any of 3 alternate servers: # ripe.net, cw.net, radb.net # Place this script -- renamed 'wh' -- in /usr/local/bin # Requires symbolic links: # ln -s /usr/local/bin/wh /usr/local/bin/wh-ripe # ln -s /usr/local/bin/wh /usr/local/bin/wh-apnic # ln -s /usr/local/bin/wh /usr/local/bin/wh-tucows E_NOARGS=75 if [ -z &quot;$1&quot; ] then echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` [domain-name]&quot; exit $E_NOARGS fi # Check script name and call proper server. case `basename $0` in # Or: case ${0##*/} in &quot;wh&quot; ) whois $1@whois.tucows.com;; &quot;wh-ripe&quot; ) whois $1@whois.ripe.net;; &quot;wh-apnic&quot; ) whois $1@whois.apnic.net;; &quot;wh-cw&quot; ) whois $1@whois.cw.net;; * ) echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` [domain-name]&quot;;; esac exit $? --- The shift command reassigns the positional parameters, in effect shifting them to the left one notch. $1 &lt;--- $2, $2 &lt;--- $3, $3 &lt;--- $4, etc. The old $1 disappears, but $0 (the script name) does not change. If you use a large number of positional parameters to a script, shift lets you access those past 10, although {bracket} notation also permits this. Example 4-7. Using shift #!/bin/bash # shft.sh: Using 'shift' to step through all the positional parameters. # Name this script something like shft.sh, #+ and invoke it with some parameters. #+ For example: # sh shft.sh a b c def 83 barndoor until [ -z &quot;$1&quot; ] # Until all parameters used up . . . do echo -n &quot;$1 &quot; shift done echo # Extra linefeed. # But, what happens to the &quot;used-up&quot; parameters? echo &quot;$2&quot; # Nothing echoes! # When $2 shifts into $1 (and there is no $3 to shift into $2) #+ then $2 remains empty. # So, it is not a parameter *copy*, but a *move*. exit # See also the echo-params.sh script for a &quot;shiftless&quot; #+ alternative method of stepping through the positional params. The shift command can take a numerical parameter indicating how many positions to shift. #!/bin/bash # shift-past.sh shift 3 # Shift 3 positions. # n=3; shift $n # Has the same effect. echo &quot;$1&quot; exit 0 # ======================== # $ sh shift-past.sh 1 2 3 4 5 4 # However, as Eleni Fragkiadaki, points out, #+ attempting a 'shift' past the number of #+ positional parameters ($#) returns an exit status of 1, #+ and the positional parameters themselves do not change. # This means possibly getting stuck in an endless loop. . . . # For example: # until [ -z &quot;$1&quot; ] # do # echo -n &quot;$1 &quot; # shift 20 # If less than 20 pos params, # done #+ then loop never ends! # # When in doubt, add a sanity check. . . . # shift 20 || break # ^^^^^^^^ Note The shift command works in a similar fashion on parameters passed to a function. See Example 36-18. Chapter 5. Quoting Quoting means just that, bracketing a string in quotes. This has the effect of protecting special characters in the string from reinterpretation or expansion by the shell or shell script. (A character is &quot;special&quot; if it has an interpretation other than its literal meaning. For example, the asterisk * represents a wild card character in globbing and Regular Expressions). bash$ ls -l [Vv]* -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 324 Apr 2 15:05 VIEWDATA.BAT -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 507 May 4 14:25 vartrace.sh -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 539 Apr 14 17:11 viewdata.sh bash$ ls -l '[Vv]*' ls: [Vv]*: No such file or directory In everyday speech or writing, when we &quot;quote&quot; a phrase, we set it apart and give it special meaning. In a Bash script, when we quote a string, we set it apart and protect its literal meaning. Certain programs and utilities reinterpret or expand special characters in a quoted string. An important use of quoting is protecting a command-line parameter from the shell, but still letting the calling program expand it. bash$ grep '[Ff]irst' *.txt file1.txt:This is the first line of file1.txt. file2.txt:This is the First line of file2.txt. Note that the unquoted grep [Ff]irst *.txt works under the Bash shell. [29] Quoting can also suppress echo's &quot;appetite&quot; for newlines. bash$ echo $(ls -l) total 8 -rw-rw-r-- 1 bo bo 13 Aug 21 12:57 t.sh -rw-rw-r-- 1 bo bo 78 Aug 21 12:57 u.sh bash$ echo &quot;$(ls -l)&quot; total 8 -rw-rw-r-- 1 bo bo 13 Aug 21 12:57 t.sh -rw-rw-r-- 1 bo bo 78 Aug 21 12:57 u.sh 5.1. Quoting Variables When referencing a variable, it is generally advisable to enclose its name in double quotes. This prevents reinterpretation of all special characters within the quoted string -- except $, ` (backquote), and \ (escape). [30] Keeping $ as a special character within double quotes permits referencing a quoted variable (&quot;$variable&quot;), that is, replacing the variable with its value (see Example 4-1, above). Use double quotes to prevent word splitting. [31] An argument enclosed in double quotes presents itself as a single word, even if it contains whitespace separators. List=&quot;one two three&quot; for a in $List # Splits the variable in parts at whitespace. do echo &quot;$a&quot; done # one # two # three echo &quot;---&quot; for a in &quot;$List&quot; # Preserves whitespace in a single variable. do # ^ ^ echo &quot;$a&quot; done # one two three A more elaborate example: variable1=&quot;a variable containing five words&quot; COMMAND This is $variable1 # Executes COMMAND with 7 arguments: # &quot;This&quot; &quot;is&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;variable&quot; &quot;containing&quot; &quot;five&quot; &quot;words&quot; COMMAND &quot;This is $variable1&quot; # Executes COMMAND with 1 argument: # &quot;This is a variable containing five words&quot; variable2=&quot;&quot; # Empty. COMMAND $variable2 $variable2 $variable2 # Executes COMMAND with no arguments. COMMAND &quot;$variable2&quot; &quot;$variable2&quot; &quot;$variable2&quot; # Executes COMMAND with 3 empty arguments. COMMAND &quot;$variable2 $variable2 $variable2&quot; # Executes COMMAND with 1 argument (2 spaces). # Thanks, Stéphane Chazelas. Tip Enclosing the arguments to an echo statement in double quotes is necessary only when word splitting or preservation of whitespace is an issue. Example 5-1.

Within single quotes, every special character except ' gets interpreted literally. Consider single quotes (&quot;full quoting&quot;) to be a stricter method of quoting than double quotes (&quot;partial quoting&quot;). Note Since even the escape character (\) gets a literal interpretation within single quotes, trying to enclose a single quote within single quotes will not yield the expected result. echo &quot;Why can't I write 's between single quotes&quot; echo # The roundabout method. echo 'Why can'\''t I write '&quot;'&quot;'s between single quotes' # |-------| |----------| |-----------------------| # Three single-quoted strings, with escaped and quoted single quotes between. # This example courtesy of Stéphane Chazelas. 5.2. Escaping Escaping is a method of quoting single characters. The escape (\) preceding a character tells the shell to interpret that character literally. Caution With certain commands and utilities, such as echo and sed, escaping a character may have the opposite effect - it can toggle on a special meaning for that character. Special meanings of certain escaped characters used with echo and sed \n means newline \r means return \t means tab \v means vertical tab \b means backspace \a means alert (beep or flash) \0xx translates to the octal ASCII equivalent of 0nn, where nn is a string of digits Important The $' ... ' quoted string-expansion construct is a mechanism that uses escaped octal or hex values to assign ASCII characters to variables, e.g., quote=$'\042'. Example 5-2.

The escape also provides a means of writing a multi-line command. Normally, each separate line constitutes a different command, but an escape at the end of a line escapes the newline character, and the command sequence continues on to the next line.

Note If a script line ends with a |, a pipe character, then a \, an escape, is not strictly necessary. It is, however, good programming practice to always escape the end of a line of code that continues to the following line. echo &quot;foo bar&quot; #foo #bar echo echo 'foo bar' # No difference yet. #foo #bar echo echo foo\ bar # Newline escaped. #foobar echo echo &quot;foo\ bar&quot; # Same here, as \ still interpreted as escape within weak quotes. #foobar echo echo 'foo\ bar' # Escape character \ taken literally because of strong quoting. #foo\ #bar # Examples suggested by Stéphane Chazelas. Chapter 6. Exit and Exit Status ... there are dark corners in the Bourne shell, and people use all of them. --Chet Ramey The exit command terminates a script, just as in a C program. It can also return a value, which is available to the script's parent process. Every command returns an exit status (sometimes referred to as a return status or exit code). A successful command returns a 0, while an unsuccessful one returns a non-zero value that usually can be interpreted as an error code. Well-behaved UNIX commands, programs, and utilities return a 0 exit code upon successful completion, though there are some exceptions. Likewise, functions within a script and the script itself return an exit status. The last command executed in the function or script determines the exit status. Within a script, an exit nnn command may be used to deliver an nnn exit status to the shell (nnn must be an integer in the 0 - 255 range). Note When a script ends with an exit that has no parameter, the exit status of the script is the exit status of the last command executed in the script (previous to the exit). #!/bin/bash COMMAND_1 . . . COMMAND_LAST # Will exit with status of last command. exit The equivalent of a bare exit is exit $? or even just omitting the exit. #!/bin/bash COMMAND_1 . . . COMMAND_LAST # Will exit with status of last command. exit $? #!/bin/bash COMMAND1 . . . COMMAND_LAST # Will exit with status of last command. $? reads the exit status of the last command executed. After a function returns, $? gives the exit status of the last command executed in the function. This is Bash's way of giving functions a &quot;return value.&quot; [32] Following the execution of a pipe, a $? gives the exit status of the last command executed. After a script terminates, a $? from the command-line gives the exit status of the script, that is, the last command executed in the script, which is, by convention, 0 on success or an integer in the range 1 - 255 on error. Example 6-1. exit / exit status #!/bin/bash echo hello echo $? # Exit status 0 returned because command executed successfully. lskdf # Unrecognized command. echo $? # Non-zero exit status returned -- command failed to execute. echo exit 113 # Will return 113 to shell. # To verify this, type &quot;echo $?&quot; after script terminates. # By convention, an 'exit 0' indicates success, #+ while a non-zero exit value means an error or anomalous condition. # See the &quot;Exit Codes With Special Meanings&quot; appendix. $? is especially useful for testing the result of a command in a script (see Example 16-35 and Example 16-20). Note The !, the logical not qualifier, reverses the outcome of a test or command, and this affects its exit status. Example 6-2. Negating a condition using ! true # The &quot;true&quot; builtin. echo &quot;exit status of \&quot;true\&quot; = $?&quot; # 0 ! true echo &quot;exit status of \&quot;! true\&quot; = $?&quot; # 1 # Note that the &quot;!&quot; needs a space between it and the command. # !true leads to a &quot;command not found&quot; error # # The '!' operator prefixing a command invokes the Bash history mechanism. true !true # No error this time, but no negation either. # It just repeats the previous command (true). # =========================================================== # # Preceding a _pipe_ with ! inverts the exit status returned. ls | bogus_command # bash: bogus_command: command not found echo $? # 127 ! ls | bogus_command # bash: bogus_command: command not found echo $? # 0 # Note that the ! does not change the execution of the pipe. # Only the exit status changes. # =========================================================== # # Thanks, Stéphane Chazelas and Kristopher Newsome. Caution Certain exit status codes have reserved meanings and should not be user-specified in a script. Chapter 7. Tests Every reasonably complete programming language can test for a condition, then act according to the result of the test. Bash has the test command, various bracket and parenthesis operators, and the if/then construct. 7.1. Test Constructs An if/then construct tests whether the exit status of a list of commands is 0 (since 0 means &quot;success&quot; by UNIX convention), and if so, executes one or more commands. There exists a dedicated command called [ (left bracket special character). It is a synonym for test, and a builtin for efficiency reasons. This command considers its arguments as comparison expressions or file tests and returns an exit status corresponding to the result of the comparison (0 for true, 1 for false). With version 2.02, Bash introduced the [[ ... ]] extended test command, which performs comparisons in a manner more familiar to programmers from other languages. Note that [[ is a keyword, not a command. Bash sees [[ $a -lt $b ]] as a single element, which returns an exit status. The (( ... )) and let ... constructs return an exit status, according to whether the arithmetic expressions they evaluate expand to a non-zero value. These arithmetic-expansion constructs may therefore be used to perform arithmetic comparisons. (( 0 &amp;&amp; 1 )) # Logical AND echo $? # 1 *** # And so ... let &quot;num = (( 0 &amp;&amp; 1 ))&quot; echo $num # 0 # But ... let &quot;num = (( 0 &amp;&amp; 1 ))&quot; echo $? # 1 *** (( 200 || 11 )) # Logical OR echo $? # 0 *** # ... let &quot;num = (( 200 || 11 ))&quot; echo $num # 1 let &quot;num = (( 200 || 11 ))&quot; echo $? # 0 *** (( 200 | 11 )) # Bitwise OR echo $? # 0 *** # ... let &quot;num = (( 200 | 11 ))&quot; echo $num # 203 let &quot;num = (( 200 | 11 ))&quot; echo $? # 0 *** # The &quot;let&quot; construct returns the same exit status #+ as the double-parentheses arithmetic expansion. Caution Again, note that the exit status of an arithmetic expression is not an error value. var=-2 &amp;&amp; (( var+=2 )) echo $? # 1 var=-2 &amp;&amp; (( var+=2 )) &amp;&amp; echo $var # Will not echo $var! An if can test any command, not just conditions enclosed within brackets. if cmp a b &amp;&gt; /dev/null # Suppress output. then echo &quot;Files a and b are identical.&quot; else echo &quot;Files a and b differ.&quot; fi # The very useful &quot;if-grep&quot; construct: # ----------------------------------- if grep -q Bash file then echo &quot;File contains at least one occurrence of Bash.&quot; fi word=Linux letter_sequence=inu if echo &quot;$word&quot; | grep -q &quot;$letter_sequence&quot; # The &quot;-q&quot; option to grep suppresses output. then echo &quot;$letter_sequence found in $word&quot; else echo &quot;$letter_sequence not found in $word&quot; fi if COMMAND_WHOSE_EXIT_STATUS_IS_0_UNLESS_ERROR_OCCURRED then echo &quot;Command succeeded.&quot; else echo &quot;Command failed.&quot; fi These last two examples courtesy of Stéphane Chazelas. Example 7-1. What is truth? #!/bin/bash # Tip: # If you're unsure how a certain condition might evaluate, #+ test it in an if-test. echo echo &quot;Testing \&quot;0\&quot;&quot; if [ 0 ] # zero then echo &quot;0 is true.&quot; else # Or else ... echo &quot;0 is false.&quot; fi # 0 is true. echo echo &quot;Testing \&quot;1\&quot;&quot; if [ 1 ] # one then echo &quot;1 is true.&quot; else echo &quot;1 is false.&quot; fi # 1 is true. echo echo &quot;Testing \&quot;-1\&quot;&quot; if [ -1 ] # minus one then echo &quot;-1 is true.&quot; else echo &quot;-1 is false.&quot; fi # -1 is true. echo echo &quot;Testing \&quot;NULL\&quot;&quot; if [ ] # NULL (empty condition) then echo &quot;NULL is true.&quot; else echo &quot;NULL is false.&quot; fi # NULL is false. echo echo &quot;Testing \&quot;xyz\&quot;&quot; if [ xyz ] # string then echo &quot;Random string is true.&quot; else echo &quot;Random string is false.&quot; fi # Random string is true. echo echo &quot;Testing \&quot;\$xyz\&quot;&quot; if [ $xyz ] # Tests if $xyz is null, but... # it's only an uninitialized variable. then echo &quot;Uninitialized variable is true.&quot; else echo &quot;Uninitialized variable is false.&quot; fi # Uninitialized variable is false. echo echo &quot;Testing \&quot;-n \$xyz\&quot;&quot; if [ -n &quot;$xyz&quot; ] # More pedantically correct. then echo &quot;Uninitialized variable is true.&quot; else echo &quot;Uninitialized variable is false.&quot; fi # Uninitialized variable is false. echo xyz= # Initialized, but set to null value. echo &quot;Testing \&quot;-n \$xyz\&quot;&quot; if [ -n &quot;$xyz&quot; ] then echo &quot;Null variable is true.&quot; else echo &quot;Null variable is false.&quot; fi # Null variable is false. echo # When is &quot;false&quot; true? echo &quot;Testing \&quot;false\&quot;&quot; if [ &quot;false&quot; ] # It seems that &quot;false&quot; is just a string ... then echo &quot;\&quot;false\&quot; is true.&quot; #+ and it tests true. else echo &quot;\&quot;false\&quot; is false.&quot; fi # &quot;false&quot; is true. echo echo &quot;Testing \&quot;\$false\&quot;&quot; # Again, uninitialized variable. if [ &quot;$false&quot; ] then echo &quot;\&quot;\$false\&quot; is true.&quot; else echo &quot;\&quot;\$false\&quot; is false.&quot; fi # &quot;$false&quot; is false. # Now, we get the expected result. # What would happen if we tested the uninitialized variable &quot;$true&quot;? echo exit 0 Exercise. Explain the behavior of Example 7-1, above. if [ condition-true ] then command 1 command 2 ... else # Or else ... # Adds default code block executing if original condition tests false. command 3 command 4 ... fi Note When if and then are on same line in a condition test, a semicolon must terminate the if statement. Both if and then are keywords. Keywords (or commands) begin statements, and before a new statement on the same line begins, the old one must terminate. if [ -x &quot;$filename&quot; ]; then Else if and elif elif elif is a contraction for else if. The effect is to nest an inner if/then construct within an outer one. if [ condition1 ] then command1 command2 command3 elif [ condition2 ] # Same as else if then command4 command5 else default-command fi The if test condition-true construct is the exact equivalent of if [ condition-true ]. As it happens, the left bracket, [ , is a token [33] which invokes the test command. The closing right bracket, ] , in an if/test should not therefore be strictly necessary, however newer versions of Bash require it. Note The test command is a Bash builtin which tests file types and compares strings. Therefore, in a Bash script, test does not call the external /usr/bin/test binary, which is part of the sh-utils package. Likewise, [ does not call /usr/bin/[, which is linked to /usr/bin/test. bash$ type test test is a shell builtin bash$ type '[' [ is a shell builtin bash$ type '[[' [[ is a shell keyword bash$ type ']]' ]] is a shell keyword bash$ type ']' bash: type: ]: not found If, for some reason, you wish to use /usr/bin/test in a Bash script, then specify it by full pathname. Example 7-2. Equivalence of test, /usr/bin/test, [ ], and /usr/bin/[ #!/bin/bash echo if test -z &quot;$1&quot; then echo &quot;No command-line arguments.&quot; else echo &quot;First command-line argument is $1.&quot; fi echo if /usr/bin/test -z &quot;$1&quot; # Equivalent to &quot;test&quot; builtin. # ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ # Specifying full pathname. then echo &quot;No command-line arguments.&quot; else echo &quot;First command-line argument is $1.&quot; fi echo if [ -z &quot;$1&quot; ] # Functionally identical to above code blocks. # if [ -z &quot;$1&quot; should work, but... #+ Bash responds to a missing close-bracket with an error message. then echo &quot;No command-line arguments.&quot; else echo &quot;First command-line argument is $1.&quot; fi echo if /usr/bin/[ -z &quot;$1&quot; ] # Again, functionally identical to above. # if /usr/bin/[ -z &quot;$1&quot; # Works, but gives an error message. # # Note: # This has been fixed in Bash, version 3.x. then echo &quot;No command-line arguments.&quot; else echo &quot;First command-line argument is $1.&quot; fi echo exit 0 The [[ ]] construct is the more versatile Bash version of [ ]. This is the extended test command, adopted from ksh88. * * * No filename expansion or word splitting takes place between [[ and ]], but there is parameter expansion and command substitution. file=/etc/passwd if [[ -e $file ]] then echo &quot;Password file exists.&quot; fi Using the [[ ... ]] test construct, rather than [ ... ] can prevent many logic errors in scripts. For example, the &amp;&amp;, ||, &lt;, and &gt; operators work within a [[ ]] test, despite giving an error within a [ ] construct. Arithmetic evaluation of octal / hexadecimal constants takes place automatically within a [[ ... ]] construct. # [[ Octal and hexadecimal evaluation ]] # Thank you, Moritz Gronbach, for pointing this out. decimal=15 octal=017 # = 15 (decimal) hex=0x0f # = 15 (decimal) if [ &quot;$decimal&quot; -eq &quot;$octal&quot; ] then echo &quot;$decimal equals $octal&quot; else echo &quot;$decimal is not equal to $octal&quot; # 15 is not equal to 017 fi # Doesn't evaluate within [ single brackets ]! if [[ &quot;$decimal&quot; -eq &quot;$octal&quot; ]] then echo &quot;$decimal equals $octal&quot; # 15 equals 017 else echo &quot;$decimal is not equal to $octal&quot; fi # Evaluates within [[ double brackets ]]! if [[ &quot;$decimal&quot; -eq &quot;$hex&quot; ]] then echo &quot;$decimal equals $hex&quot; # 15 equals 0x0f else echo &quot;$decimal is not equal to $hex&quot; fi # [[ $hexadecimal ]] also evaluates! Note Following an if, neither the test command nor the test brackets ( [ ] or [[ ]] ) are strictly necessary. dir=/home/bozo if cd &quot;$dir&quot; 2&gt;/dev/null; then # &quot;2&gt;/dev/null&quot; hides error message. echo &quot;Now in $dir.&quot; else echo &quot;Can't change to $dir.&quot; fi The &quot;if COMMAND&quot; construct returns the exit status of COMMAND. Similarly, a condition within test brackets may stand alone without an if, when used in combination with a list construct. var1=20 var2=22 [ &quot;$var1&quot; -ne &quot;$var2&quot; ] &amp;&amp; echo &quot;$var1 is not equal to $var2&quot; home=/home/bozo [ -d &quot;$home&quot; ] || echo &quot;$home directory does not exist.&quot; The (( )) construct expands and evaluates an arithmetic expression. If the expression evaluates as zero, it returns an exit status of 1, or &quot;false&quot;. A non-zero expression returns an exit status of 0, or &quot;true&quot;. This is in marked contrast to using the test and [ ] constructs previously discussed. Example 7-3.

It has been &quot;deprecated,&quot; [34] and its use is discouraged. -f file is a regular file (not a directory or device file) -s file is not zero size -d file is a directory -b file is a block device -c file is a character device device0=&quot;/dev/sda2&quot; # / (root directory) if [ -b &quot;$device0&quot; ] then echo &quot;$device0 is a block device.&quot; fi # /dev/sda2 is a block device. device1=&quot;/dev/ttyS1&quot; # PCMCIA modem card. if [ -c &quot;$device1&quot; ] then echo &quot;$device1 is a character device.&quot; fi # /dev/ttyS1 is a character device. -p file is a pipe function show_input_type() { [ -p /dev/fd/0 ] &amp;&amp; echo PIPE || echo STDIN } show_input_type &quot;Input&quot; # STDIN echo &quot;Input&quot; | show_input_type # PIPE # This example courtesy of Carl Anderson. -h file is a symbolic link -L file is a symbolic link -S file is a socket -t file (descriptor) is associated with a terminal device This test option may be used to check whether the stdin [ -t 0 ] or stdout [ -t 1 ] in a given script is a terminal. -r file has read permission (for the user running the test) -w file has write permission (for the user running the test) -x file has execute permission (for the user running the test) -g set-group-id (sgid) flag set on file or directory If a directory has the sgid flag set, then a file created within that directory belongs to the group that owns the directory, not necessarily to the group of the user who created the file. This may be useful for a directory shared by a workgroup. -u set-user-id (suid) flag set on file A binary owned by root with set-user-id flag set runs with root privileges, even when an ordinary user invokes it. [35] This is useful for executables (such as pppd and cdrecord) that need to access system hardware. Lacking the suid flag, these binaries could not be invoked by a non-root user. -rwsr-xr-t 1 root 178236 Oct 2 2000 /usr/sbin/pppd A file with the suid flag set shows an s in its permissions. -k sticky bit set Commonly known as the sticky bit, the save-text-mode flag is a special type of file permission. If a file has this flag set, that file will be kept in cache memory, for quicker access. [36] If set on a directory, it restricts write permission. Setting the sticky bit adds a t to the permissions on the file or directory listing. This restricts altering or deleting specific files in that directory to the owner of those files. drwxrwxrwt 7 root 1024 May 19 21:26 tmp/ If a user does not own a directory that has the sticky bit set, but has write permission in that directory, she can only delete those files that she owns in it. This keeps users from inadvertently overwriting or deleting each other's files in a publicly accessible directory, such as /tmp. (The owner of the directory or root can, of course, delete or rename files there.) -O you are owner of file -G group-id of file same as yours -N file modified since it was last read f1 -nt f2 file f1 is newer than f2 f1 -ot f2 file f1 is older than f2 f1 -ef f2 files f1 and f2 are hard links to the same file ! &quot;not&quot; -- reverses the sense of the tests above (returns true if condition absent). Example 7-4. Testing for broken links #!/bin/bash # broken-link.sh # Written by Lee bigelow &lt;ligelowbee@yahoo.com&gt; # Used in ABS Guide with permission. # A pure shell script to find dead symlinks and output them quoted #+ so they can be fed to xargs and dealt with :) #+ eg. sh broken-link.sh /somedir /someotherdir|xargs rm # # This, however, is a better method: # # find &quot;somedir&quot; -type l -print0|\ # xargs -r0 file|\ # grep &quot;broken symbolic&quot;| # sed -e 's/^\|: *broken symbolic.*$/&quot;/g' # #+ but that wouldn't be pure Bash, now would it. # Caution: beware the /proc file system and any circular links! ################################################################ # If no args are passed to the script set directories-to-search #+ to current directory. Otherwise set the directories-to-search #+ to the args passed. ###################### [ $# -eq 0 ] &amp;&amp; directorys=`pwd` || directorys=$@ # Setup the function linkchk to check the directory it is passed #+ for files that are links and don't exist, then print them quoted. # If one of the elements in the directory is a subdirectory then #+ send that subdirectory to the linkcheck function. ########## linkchk () { for element in $1/*; do [ -h &quot;$element&quot; -a ! -e &quot;$element&quot; ] &amp;&amp; echo \&quot;$element\&quot; [ -d &quot;$element&quot; ] &amp;&amp; linkchk $element # Of course, '-h' tests for symbolic link, '-d' for directory. done } # Send each arg that was passed to the script to the linkchk() function #+ if it is a valid directoy. If not, then print the error message #+ and usage info. ################## for directory in $directorys; do if [ -d $directory ] then linkchk $directory else echo &quot;$directory is not a directory&quot; echo &quot;Usage: $0 dir1 dir2 ...&quot; fi done exit $? Example 31-1, Example 11-8, Example 11-3, Example 31-3, and Example A-1 also illustrate uses of the file test operators. 7.3. Other Comparison Operators A binary comparison operator compares two variables or quantities. Note that integer and string comparison use a different set of operators. integer comparison -eq is equal to if [ &quot;$a&quot; -eq &quot;$b&quot; ] -ne is not equal to if [ &quot;$a&quot; -ne &quot;$b&quot; ] -gt is greater than if [ &quot;$a&quot; -gt &quot;$b&quot; ] -ge is greater than or equal to if [ &quot;$a&quot; -ge &quot;$b&quot; ] -lt is less than if [ &quot;$a&quot; -lt &quot;$b&quot; ] -le is less than or equal to if [ &quot;$a&quot; -le &quot;$b&quot; ] &lt; is less than (within double parentheses) ((&quot;$a&quot; &lt; &quot;$b&quot;)) &lt;= is less than or equal to (within double parentheses) ((&quot;$a&quot; &lt;= &quot;$b&quot;)) &gt; is greater than (within double parentheses) ((&quot;$a&quot; &gt; &quot;$b&quot;)) &gt;= is greater than or equal to (within double parentheses) ((&quot;$a&quot; &gt;= &quot;$b&quot;)) string comparison = is equal to if [ &quot;$a&quot; = &quot;$b&quot; ] Caution Note the whitespace framing the =. if [ &quot;$a&quot;=&quot;$b&quot; ] is not equivalent to the above. == is equal to if [ &quot;$a&quot; == &quot;$b&quot; ] This is a synonym for =. Note The == comparison operator behaves differently within a double-brackets test than within single brackets. [[ $a == z* ]] # True if $a starts with an &quot;z&quot; (pattern matching). [[ $a == &quot;z*&quot; ]] # True if $a is equal to z* (literal matching). [ $a == z* ] # File globbing and word splitting take place. [ &quot;$a&quot; == &quot;z*&quot; ] # True if $a is equal to z* (literal matching). # Thanks, Stéphane Chazelas != is not equal to if [ &quot;$a&quot; != &quot;$b&quot; ] This operator uses pattern matching within a [[ ... ]] construct. &lt; is less than, in ASCII alphabetical order if [[ &quot;$a&quot; &lt; &quot;$b&quot; ]] if [ &quot;$a&quot; \&lt; &quot;$b&quot; ] Note that the &quot;&lt;&quot; needs to be escaped within a [ ] construct. &gt; is greater than, in ASCII alphabetical order if [[ &quot;$a&quot; &gt; &quot;$b&quot; ]] if [ &quot;$a&quot; \&gt; &quot;$b&quot; ] Note that the &quot;&gt;&quot; needs to be escaped within a [ ] construct. See Example 27-11 for an application of this comparison operator. -z string is null, that is, has zero length String='' # Zero-length (&quot;null&quot;) string variable. if [ -z &quot;$String&quot; ] then echo &quot;\$String is null.&quot; else echo &quot;\$String is NOT null.&quot; fi # $String is null. -n string is not null. Caution The -n test requires that the string be quoted within the test brackets. Using an unquoted string with ! -z, or even just the unquoted string alone within test brackets (see Example 7-6) normally works, however, this is an unsafe practice. Always quote a tested string. [37] Example 7-5. Arithmetic and string comparisons #!/bin/bash a=4 b=5 # Here &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; can be treated either as integers or strings. # There is some blurring between the arithmetic and string comparisons, #+ since Bash variables are not strongly typed. # Bash permits integer operations and comparisons on variables #+ whose value consists of all-integer characters. # Caution advised, however. echo if [ &quot;$a&quot; -ne &quot;$b&quot; ] then echo &quot;$a is not equal to $b&quot; echo &quot;(arithmetic comparison)&quot; fi echo if [ &quot;$a&quot; != &quot;$b&quot; ] then echo &quot;$a is not equal to $b.&quot; echo &quot;(string comparison)&quot; # &quot;4&quot; != &quot;5&quot; # ASCII 52 != ASCII 53 fi # In this particular instance, both &quot;-ne&quot; and &quot;!=&quot; work. echo exit 0 Example 7-6. Testing whether a string is null #!/bin/bash # str-test.sh: Testing null strings and unquoted strings, #+ but not strings and sealing wax, not to mention cabbages and kings . . . # Using if [ ... ] # If a string has not been initialized, it has no defined value. # This state is called &quot;null&quot; (not the same as zero!). if [ -n $string1 ] # string1 has not been declared or initialized. then echo &quot;String \&quot;string1\&quot; is not null.&quot; else echo &quot;String \&quot;string1\&quot; is null.&quot; fi # Wrong result. # Shows $string1 as not null, although it was not initialized. echo # Let's try it again. if [ -n &quot;$string1&quot; ] # This time, $string1 is quoted. then echo &quot;String \&quot;string1\&quot; is not null.&quot; else echo &quot;String \&quot;string1\&quot; is null.&quot; fi # Quote strings within test brackets! echo if [ $string1 ] # This time, $string1 stands naked. then echo &quot;String \&quot;string1\&quot; is not null.&quot; else echo &quot;String \&quot;string1\&quot; is null.&quot; fi # This works fine. # The [ ... ] test operator alone detects whether the string is null. # However it is good practice to quote it (if [ &quot;$string1&quot; ]). # # As Stephane Chazelas points out, # if [ $string1 ] has one argument, &quot;]&quot; # if [ &quot;$string1&quot; ] has two arguments, the empty &quot;$string1&quot; and &quot;]&quot; echo string1=initialized if [ $string1 ] # Again, $string1 stands unquoted. then echo &quot;String \&quot;string1\&quot; is not null.&quot; else echo &quot;String \&quot;string1\&quot; is null.&quot; fi # Again, gives correct result. # Still, it is better to quote it (&quot;$string1&quot;), because . . . string1=&quot;a = b&quot; if [ $string1 ] # Again, $string1 stands unquoted. then echo &quot;String \&quot;string1\&quot; is not null.&quot; else echo &quot;String \&quot;string1\&quot; is null.&quot; fi # Not quoting &quot;$string1&quot; now gives wrong result! exit 0 # Thank you, also, Florian Wisser, for the &quot;heads-up&quot;. Example 7-7. zmore #!/bin/bash # zmore # View gzipped files with 'more' filter. E_NOARGS=85 E_NOTFOUND=86 E_NOTGZIP=87 if [ $# -eq 0 ] # same effect as: if [ -z &quot;$1&quot; ] # $1 can exist, but be empty: zmore &quot;&quot; arg2 arg3 then echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` filename&quot; &gt;&amp;2 # Error message to stderr. exit $E_NOARGS # Returns 85 as exit status of script (error code). fi filename=$1 if [ ! -f &quot;$filename&quot; ] # Quoting $filename allows for possible spaces. then echo &quot;File $filename not found!&quot; &gt;&amp;2 # Error message to stderr. exit $E_NOTFOUND fi if [ ${filename##*.} != &quot;gz&quot; ] # Using bracket in variable substitution. then echo &quot;File $1 is not a gzipped file!&quot; exit $E_NOTGZIP fi zcat $1 | more # Uses the 'more' filter. # May substitute 'less' if desired. exit $? # Script returns exit status of pipe. # Actually &quot;exit $?&quot; is unnecessary, as the script will, in any case, #+ return the exit status of the last command executed. compound comparison -a logical and exp1 -a exp2 returns true if both exp1 and exp2 are true. -o logical or exp1 -o exp2 returns true if either exp1 or exp2 is true. These are similar to the Bash comparison operators &amp;&amp; and ||, used within double brackets. [[ condition1 &amp;&amp; condition2 ]] The -o and -a operators work with the test command or occur within single test brackets. if [ &quot;$expr1&quot; -a &quot;$expr2&quot; ] then echo &quot;Both expr1 and expr2 are true.&quot; else echo &quot;Either expr1 or expr2 is false.&quot; fi Caution But, as rihad points out: [ 1 -eq 1 ] &amp;&amp; [ -n &quot;`echo true 1&gt;&amp;2`&quot; ] # true [ 1 -eq 2 ] &amp;&amp; [ -n &quot;`echo true 1&gt;&amp;2`&quot; ] # (no output) # ^^^^^^^ False condition. So far, everything as expected. # However ... [ 1 -eq 2 -a -n &quot;`echo true 1&gt;&amp;2`&quot; ] # true # ^^^^^^^ False condition. So, why &quot;true&quot; output? # Is it because both condition clauses within brackets evaluate? [[ 1 -eq 2 &amp;&amp; -n &quot;`echo true 1&gt;&amp;2`&quot; ]] # (no output) # No, that's not it. # Apparently &amp;&amp; and || &quot;short-circuit&quot; while -a and -o do not. Refer to Example 8-3, Example 27-17, and Example A-29 to see compound comparison operators in action. 7.4. Nested if/then Condition Tests Condition tests using the if/then construct may be nested. The net result is equivalent to using the &amp;&amp; compound comparison operator. a=3 if [ &quot;$a&quot; -gt 0 ] then if [ &quot;$a&quot; -lt 5 ] then echo &quot;The value of \&quot;a\&quot; lies somewhere between 0 and 5.&quot; fi fi # Same result as: if [ &quot;$a&quot; -gt 0 ] &amp;&amp; [ &quot;$a&quot; -lt 5 ] then echo &quot;The value of \&quot;a\&quot; lies somewhere between 0 and 5.&quot; fi Example 37-4 and Example 17-11 demonstrate nested if/then condition tests. 7.5. Testing Your Knowledge of Tests The systemwide xinitrc file can be used to launch the X server. This file contains quite a number of if/then tests. The following is excerpted from an &quot;ancient&quot; version of xinitrc (Red Hat 7.1, or thereabouts). if [ -f $HOME/.Xclients ]; then exec $HOME/.Xclients elif [ -f /etc/X11/xinit/Xclients ]; then exec /etc/X11/xinit/Xclients else # failsafe settings. Although we should never get here # (we provide fallbacks in Xclients as well) it can't hurt. xclock -geometry 100x100-5+5 &amp; xterm -geometry 80x50-50+150 &amp; if [ -f /usr/bin/netscape -a -f /usr/share/doc/HTML/index.html ]; then netscape /usr/share/doc/HTML/index.html &amp; fi fi Explain the test constructs in the above snippet, then examine an updated version of the file, /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc, and analyze the if/then test constructs there. You may need to refer ahead to the discussions of grep, sed, and regular expressions. Chapter 8. Operations and Related Topics 8.1. Operators assignment variable assignment Initializing or changing the value of a variable = All-purpose assignment operator, which works for both arithmetic and string assignments. var=27 category=minerals # No spaces allowed after the &quot;=&quot;. Caution Do not confuse the &quot;=&quot; assignment operator with the = test operator. # = as a test operator if [ &quot;$string1&quot; = &quot;$string2&quot; ] then command fi # if [ &quot;X$string1&quot; = &quot;X$string2&quot; ] is safer, #+ to prevent an error message should one of the variables be empty. # (The prepended &quot;X&quot; characters cancel out.) arithmetic operators + plus - minus * multiplication / division ** exponentiation # Bash, version 2.02, introduced the &quot;**&quot; exponentiation operator. let &quot;z=5**3&quot; # 5 * 5 * 5 echo &quot;z = $z&quot; # z = 125 % modulo, or mod (returns the remainder of an integer division operation) bash$ expr 5 % 3 2 5/3 = 1, with remainder 2 This operator finds use in, among other things, generating numbers within a specific range (see Example 9-11 and Example 9-15) and formatting program output (see Example 27-16 and Example A-6). It can even be used to generate prime numbers, (see Example A-15). Modulo turns up surprisingly often in numerical recipes. Example 8-1. Greatest common divisor #!/bin/bash # gcd.sh: greatest common divisor # Uses Euclid's algorithm # The &quot;greatest common divisor&quot; (gcd) of two integers #+ is the largest integer that will divide both, leaving no remainder. # Euclid's algorithm uses successive division. # In each pass, #+ dividend &lt;--- divisor #+ divisor &lt;--- remainder #+ until remainder = 0. # The gcd = dividend, on the final pass. # # For an excellent discussion of Euclid's algorithm, see #+ Jim Loy's site, http://www.jimloy.com/number/euclids.htm. # ------------------------------------------------------ # Argument check ARGS=2 E_BADARGS=85 if [ $# -ne &quot;$ARGS&quot; ] then echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` first-number second-number&quot; exit $E_BADARGS fi # ------------------------------------------------------ gcd () { dividend=$1 # Arbitrary assignment. divisor=$2 #! It doesn't matter which of the two is larger. # Why not? remainder=1 # If an uninitialized variable is used inside #+ test brackets, an error message results. until [ &quot;$remainder&quot; -eq 0 ] do # ^^^^^^^^^^ Must be previously initialized! let &quot;remainder = $dividend % $divisor&quot; dividend=$divisor # Now repeat with 2 smallest numbers. divisor=$remainder done # Euclid's algorithm } # Last $dividend is the gcd. gcd $1 $2 echo; echo &quot;GCD of $1 and $2 = $dividend&quot;; echo # Exercises : # --------- # 1) Check command-line arguments to make sure they are integers, #+ and exit the script with an appropriate error message if not. # 2) Rewrite the gcd () function to use local variables. exit 0 += plus-equal (increment variable by a constant) [38] let &quot;var += 5&quot; results in var being incremented by 5. -= minus-equal (decrement variable by a constant) *= times-equal (multiply variable by a constant) let &quot;var *= 4&quot; results in var being multiplied by 4. /= slash-equal (divide variable by a constant) %= mod-equal (remainder of dividing variable by a constant) Arithmetic operators often occur in an expr or let expression. Example 8-2. Using Arithmetic Operations #!/bin/bash # Counting to 11 in 10 different ways. n=1; echo -n &quot;$n &quot; let &quot;n = $n + 1&quot; # let &quot;n = n + 1&quot; also works. echo -n &quot;$n &quot; : $((n = $n + 1)) # &quot;:&quot; necessary because otherwise Bash attempts #+ to interpret &quot;$((n = $n + 1))&quot; as a command. echo -n &quot;$n &quot; (( n = n + 1 )) # A simpler alternative to the method above. # Thanks, David Lombard, for pointing this out. echo -n &quot;$n &quot; n=$(($n + 1)) echo -n &quot;$n &quot; : $[ n = $n + 1 ] # &quot;:&quot; necessary because otherwise Bash attempts #+ to interpret &quot;$[ n = $n + 1 ]&quot; as a command. # Works even if &quot;n&quot; was initialized as a string. echo -n &quot;$n &quot; n=$[ $n + 1 ] # Works even if &quot;n&quot; was initialized as a string. #* Avoid this type of construct, since it is obsolete and nonportable. # Thanks, Stephane Chazelas. echo -n &quot;$n &quot; # Now for C-style increment operators. # Thanks, Frank Wang, for pointing this out. let &quot;n++&quot; # let &quot;++n&quot; also works. echo -n &quot;$n &quot; (( n++ )) # (( ++n )) also works. echo -n &quot;$n &quot; : $(( n++ )) # : $(( ++n )) also works. echo -n &quot;$n &quot; : $[ n++ ] # : $[ ++n ] also works echo -n &quot;$n &quot; echo exit 0 Note Integer variables in older versions of Bash were signed long (32-bit) integers, in the range of -2147483648 to 2147483647. An operation that took a variable outside these limits gave an erroneous result. echo $BASH_VERSION # 1.14 a=2147483646 echo &quot;a = $a&quot; # a = 2147483646 let &quot;a+=1&quot; # Increment &quot;a&quot;. echo &quot;a = $a&quot; # a = 2147483647 let &quot;a+=1&quot; # increment &quot;a&quot; again, past the limit. echo &quot;a = $a&quot; # a = -2147483648 # ERROR: out of range, # + and the leftmost bit, the sign bit, # + has been set, making the result negative. As of version &gt;= 2.05b, Bash supports 64-bit integers. Caution Bash does not understand floating point arithmetic. It treats numbers containing a decimal point as strings. a=1.5 let &quot;b = $a + 1.3&quot; # Error. # t2.sh: let: b = 1.5 + 1.3: syntax error in expression # (error token is &quot;.5 + 1.3&quot;) echo &quot;b = $b&quot; # b=1 Use bc in scripts that that need floating point calculations or math library functions. bitwise operators. The bitwise operators seldom make an appearance in shell scripts. Their chief use seems to be manipulating and testing values read from ports or sockets. &quot;Bit flipping&quot; is more relevant to compiled languages, such as C and C++, which provide direct access to system hardware. However, see vladz's ingenious use of bitwise operators in his base64.sh (Example A-54) script. bitwise operators &lt;&lt; bitwise left shift (multiplies by 2 for each shift position) &lt;&lt;= left-shift-equal let &quot;var &lt;&lt;= 2&quot; results in var left-shifted 2 bits (multiplied by 4) &gt;&gt; bitwise right shift (divides by 2 for each shift position) &gt;&gt;= right-shift-equal (inverse of &lt;&lt;=) &amp; bitwise AND &amp;= bitwise AND-equal | bitwise OR |= bitwise OR-equal ~ bitwise NOT ^ bitwise XOR ^= bitwise XOR-equal logical (boolean) operators ! NOT if [ ! -f $FILENAME ] then ... &amp;&amp; AND if [ $condition1 ] &amp;&amp; [ $condition2 ] # Same as: if [ $condition1 -a $condition2 ] # Returns true if both condition1 and condition2 hold true... if [[ $condition1 &amp;&amp; $condition2 ]] # Also works. # Note that &amp;&amp; operator not permitted inside brackets #+ of [ ... ] construct. Note &amp;&amp; may also be used, depending on context, in an and list to concatenate commands. || OR if [ $condition1 ] || [ $condition2 ] # Same as: if [ $condition1 -o $condition2 ] # Returns true if either condition1 or condition2 holds true... if [[ $condition1 || $condition2 ]] # Also works. # Note that || operator not permitted inside brackets #+ of a [ ... ] construct. Note Bash tests the exit status of each statement linked with a logical operator. Example 8-3. Compound Condition Tests Using &amp;&amp; and || #!/bin/bash a=24 b=47 if [ &quot;$a&quot; -eq 24 ] &amp;&amp; [ &quot;$b&quot; -eq 47 ] then echo &quot;Test #1 succeeds.&quot; else echo &quot;Test #1 fails.&quot; fi # ERROR: if [ &quot;$a&quot; -eq 24 &amp;&amp; &quot;$b&quot; -eq 47 ] #+ attempts to execute ' [ &quot;$a&quot; -eq 24 ' #+ and fails to finding matching ']'. # # Note: if [[ $a -eq 24 &amp;&amp; $b -eq 24 ]] works. # The double-bracket if-test is more flexible #+ than the single-bracket version. # (The &quot;&amp;&amp;&quot; has a different meaning in line 17 than in line 6.) # Thanks, Stephane Chazelas, for pointing this out. if [ &quot;$a&quot; -eq 98 ] || [ &quot;$b&quot; -eq 47 ] then echo &quot;Test #2 succeeds.&quot; else echo &quot;Test #2 fails.&quot; fi # The -a and -o options provide #+ an alternative compound condition test. # Thanks to Patrick Callahan for pointing this out. if [ &quot;$a&quot; -eq 24 -a &quot;$b&quot; -eq 47 ] then echo &quot;Test #3 succeeds.&quot; else echo &quot;Test #3 fails.&quot; fi if [ &quot;$a&quot; -eq 98 -o &quot;$b&quot; -eq 47 ] then echo &quot;Test #4 succeeds.&quot; else echo &quot;Test #4 fails.&quot; fi a=rhino b=crocodile if [ &quot;$a&quot; = rhino ] &amp;&amp; [ &quot;$b&quot; = crocodile ] then echo &quot;Test #5 succeeds.&quot; else echo &quot;Test #5 fails.&quot; fi exit 0 The &amp;&amp; and || operators also find use in an arithmetic context. bash$ echo $(( 1 &amp;&amp; 2 )) $((3 &amp;&amp; 0)) $((4 || 0)) $((0 || 0)) 1 0 1 0 miscellaneous operators , Comma operator The comma operator chains together two or more arithmetic operations. All the operations are evaluated (with possible side effects. [39] let &quot;t1 = ((5 + 3, 7 - 1, 15 - 4))&quot; echo &quot;t1 = $t1&quot; ^^^^^^ # t1 = 11 # Here t1 is set to the result of the last operation. Why? let &quot;t2 = ((a = 9, 15 / 3))&quot; # Set &quot;a&quot; and calculate &quot;t2&quot;. echo &quot;t2 = $t2 a = $a&quot; # t2 = 5 a = 9 The comma operator finds use mainly in for loops. See Example 11-13. 8.2. Numerical Constants A shell script interprets a number as decimal (base 10), unless that number has a special prefix or notation. A number preceded by a 0 is octal (base 8). A number preceded by 0x is hexadecimal (base 16). A number with an embedded # evaluates as BASE#NUMBER (with range and notational restrictions). Example 8-4. Representation of numerical constants #!/bin/bash # numbers.sh: Representation of numbers in different bases. # Decimal: the default let &quot;dec = 32&quot; echo &quot;decimal number = $dec&quot; # 32 # Nothing out of the ordinary here. # Octal: numbers preceded by '0' (zero) let &quot;oct = 032&quot; echo &quot;octal number = $oct&quot; # 26 # Expresses result in decimal. # --------- ------ -- ------- # Hexadecimal: numbers preceded by '0x' or '0X' let &quot;hex = 0x32&quot; echo &quot;hexadecimal number = $hex&quot; # 50 echo $((0x9abc)) # 39612 # ^^ ^^ double-parentheses arithmetic expansion/evaluation # Expresses result in decimal. # Other bases: BASE#NUMBER # BASE between 2 and 64. # NUMBER must use symbols within the BASE range, see below. let &quot;bin = 2#111100111001101&quot; echo &quot;binary number = $bin&quot; # 31181 let &quot;b32 = 32#77&quot; echo &quot;base-32 number = $b32&quot; # 231 let &quot;b64 = 64#@_&quot; echo &quot;base-64 number = $b64&quot; # 4031 # This notation only works for a limited range (2 - 64) of ASCII characters. # 10 digits + 26 lowercase characters + 26 uppercase characters + @ + _ echo echo $((36#zz)) $((2#10101010)) $((16#AF16)) $((53#1aA)) # 1295 170 44822 3375 # Important note: # -------------- # Using a digit out of range of the specified base notation #+ gives an error message. let &quot;bad_oct = 081&quot; # (Partial) error message output: # bad_oct = 081: value too great for base (error token is &quot;081&quot;) # Octal numbers use only digits in the range 0 - 7. exit $? # Exit value = 1 (error) # Thanks, Rich Bartell and Stephane Chazelas, for clarification. 8.3. The Double-Parentheses Construct Similar to the let command, the (( ... )) construct permits arithmetic expansion and evaluation. In its simplest form, a=$(( 5 + 3 )) would set a to 5 + 3, or 8. However, this double-parentheses construct is also a mechanism for allowing C-style manipulation of variables in Bash, for example, (( var++ )). Example 8-5. C-style manipulation of variables #!/bin/bash # c-vars.sh # Manipulating a variable, C-style, using the (( ... )) construct. echo (( a = 23 )) # Setting a value, C-style, #+ with spaces on both sides of the &quot;=&quot;. echo &quot;a (initial value) = $a&quot; # 23 (( a++ )) # Post-increment 'a', C-style. echo &quot;a (after a++) = $a&quot; # 24 (( a-- )) # Post-decrement 'a', C-style. echo &quot;a (after a--) = $a&quot; # 23 (( ++a )) # Pre-increment 'a', C-style. echo &quot;a (after ++a) = $a&quot; # 24 (( --a )) # Pre-decrement 'a', C-style. echo &quot;a (after --a) = $a&quot; # 23 echo ######################################################## # Note that, as in C, pre- and post-decrement operators #+ have different side-effects. n=1; let --n &amp;&amp; echo &quot;True&quot; || echo &quot;False&quot; # False n=1; let n-- &amp;&amp; echo &quot;True&quot; || echo &quot;False&quot; # True # Thanks, Jeroen Domburg. ######################################################## echo (( t = a&lt;45?7:11 )) # C-style trinary operator. # ^ ^ ^ echo &quot;If a &lt; 45, then t = 7, else t = 11.&quot; # a = 23 echo &quot;t = $t &quot; # t = 7 echo # ----------------- # Easter Egg alert! # ----------------- # Chet Ramey seems to have snuck a bunch of undocumented C-style #+ constructs into Bash (actually adapted from ksh, pretty much). # In the Bash docs, Ramey calls (( ... )) shell arithmetic, #+ but it goes far beyond that. # Sorry, Chet, the secret is out. # See also &quot;for&quot; and &quot;while&quot; loops using the (( ... )) construct. # These work only with version 2.04 or later of Bash. exit See also Example 11-13 and Example 8-4. 8.4. Operator Precedence In a script, operations execute in order of precedence: the higher precedence operations execute before the lower precedence ones. [40] Table 8-1. Operator Precedence Operator Meaning Comments HIGHEST PRECEDENCE var++ var-- post-increment, post-decrement C-style operators ++var --var pre-increment, pre-decrement ! ~ negation logical / bitwise, inverts sense of following operator ** exponentiation arithmetic operation * / % multiplication, division, modulo arithmetic operation + - addition, subtraction arithmetic operation &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; left, right shift bitwise -z -n unary comparison string is/is-not null -e -f -t -x, etc. unary comparison file-test &lt; -lt &gt; -gt &lt;= -le &gt;= -ge compound comparison string and integer -nt -ot -ef compound comparison file-test == -eq != -ne equality / inequality test operators, string and integer &amp; AND bitwise ^ XOR exclusive OR, bitwise | OR bitwise &amp;&amp; -a AND logical, compound comparison || -o OR logical, compound comparison ?: trinary operator C-style = assignment (do not confuse with equality test) *= /= %= += -= &lt;&lt;= &gt;&gt;= &amp;= combination assignment times-equal, divide-equal, mod-equal, etc. , comma links a sequence of operations LOWEST PRECEDENCE In practice, all you really need to remember is the following: The &quot;My Dear Aunt Sally&quot; mantra (multiply, divide, add, subtract) for the familiar arithmetic operations. The compound logical operators, &amp;&amp;, ||, -a, and -o have low precedence. The order of evaluation of equal-precedence operators is usually left-to-right. Now, let's utilize our knowledge of operator precedence to analyze a couple of lines from the /etc/init.d/functions file, as found in the Fedora Core Linux distro. while [ -n &quot;$remaining&quot; -a &quot;$retry&quot; -gt 0 ]; do # This looks rather daunting at first glance. # Separate the conditions: while [ -n &quot;$remaining&quot; -a &quot;$retry&quot; -gt 0 ]; do # --condition 1-- ^^ --condition 2- # If variable &quot;$remaining&quot; is not zero length #+ AND (-a) #+ variable &quot;$retry&quot; is greater-than zero #+ then #+ the [ expresion-within-condition-brackets ] returns success (0) #+ and the while-loop executes an iteration. # ============================================================== # Evaluate &quot;condition 1&quot; and &quot;condition 2&quot; ***before*** #+ ANDing them. Why? Because the AND (-a) has a lower precedence #+ than the -n and -gt operators, #+ and therefore gets evaluated *last*. ################################################################# if [ -f /etc/sysconfig/i18n -a -z &quot;${NOLOCALE:-}&quot; ] ; then # Again, separate the conditions: if [ -f /etc/sysconfig/i18n -a -z &quot;${NOLOCALE:-}&quot; ] ; then # --condition 1--------- ^^ --condition 2----- # If file &quot;/etc/sysconfig/i18n&quot; exists #+ AND (-a) #+ variable $NOLOCALE is zero length #+ then #+ the [ test-expresion-within-condition-brackets ] returns success (0) #+ and the commands following execute. # # As before, the AND (-a) gets evaluated *last* #+ because it has the lowest precedence of the operators within #+ the test brackets. # ============================================================== # Note: # ${NOLOCALE:-} is a parameter expansion that seems redundant. # But, if $NOLOCALE has not been declared, it gets set to *null*, #+ in effect declaring it. # This makes a difference in some contexts. Tip To avoid confusion or error in a complex sequence of test operators, break up the sequence into bracketed sections. if [ &quot;$v1&quot; -gt &quot;$v2&quot; -o &quot;$v1&quot; -lt &quot;$v2&quot; -a -e &quot;$filename&quot; ] # Unclear what's going on here... if [[ &quot;$v1&quot; -gt &quot;$v2&quot; ]] || [[ &quot;$v1&quot; -lt &quot;$v2&quot; ]] &amp;&amp; [[ -e &quot;$filename&quot; ]] # Much better -- the condition tests are grouped in logical sections.

This requires learning their subtleties and nuances. 9.1. Internal Variables Builtin variables: variables affecting bash script behavior $BASH The path to the Bash binary itself bash$ echo $BASH /bin/bash $BASH_ENV An environmental variable pointing to a Bash startup file to be read when a script is invoked $BASH_SUBSHELL A variable indicating the subshell level. This is a new addition to Bash, version 3. See Example 21-1 for usage. $BASHPID Process ID of the current instance of Bash. This is not the same as the $$ variable, but it often gives the same result. bash4$ echo $$ 11015 bash4$ echo $BASHPID 11015 bash4$ ps ax | grep bash4 11015 pts/2 R 0:00 bash4 But ... #!/bin/bash4 echo &quot;\$\$ outside of subshell = $$&quot; # 9602 echo &quot;\$BASH_SUBSHELL outside of subshell = $BASH_SUBSHELL&quot; # 0 echo &quot;\$BASHPID outside of subshell = $BASHPID&quot; # 9602 echo ( echo &quot;\$\$ inside of subshell = $$&quot; # 9602 echo &quot;\$BASH_SUBSHELL inside of subshell = $BASH_SUBSHELL&quot; # 1 echo &quot;\$BASHPID inside of subshell = $BASHPID&quot; ) # 9603 # Note that $$ returns PID of parent process. $BASH_VERSINFO[n] A 6-element array containing version information about the installed release of Bash. This is similar to $BASH_VERSION, below, but a bit more detailed. # Bash version info: for n in 0 1 2 3 4 5 do echo &quot;BASH_VERSINFO[$n] = ${BASH_VERSINFO[$n]}&quot; done # BASH_VERSINFO[0] = 3 # Major version no. # BASH_VERSINFO[1] = 00 # Minor version no. # BASH_VERSINFO[2] = 14 # Patch level. # BASH_VERSINFO[3] = 1 # Build version. # BASH_VERSINFO[4] = release # Release status. # BASH_VERSINFO[5] = i386-redhat-linux-gnu # Architecture # (same as $MACHTYPE). $BASH_VERSION The version of Bash installed on the system bash$ echo $BASH_VERSION 3.2.25(1)-release tcsh% echo $BASH_VERSION BASH_VERSION: Undefined variable. Checking $BASH_VERSION is a good method of determining which shell is running. $SHELL does not necessarily give the correct answer. $CDPATH A colon-separated list of search paths available to the cd command, similar in function to the $PATH variable for binaries. The $CDPATH variable may be set in the local ~/.bashrc file. bash$ cd bash-doc bash: cd: bash-doc: No such file or directory bash$ CDPATH=/usr/share/doc bash$ cd bash-doc /usr/share/doc/bash-doc bash$ echo $PWD /usr/share/doc/bash-doc $DIRSTACK The top value in the directory stack [41] (affected by pushd and popd) This builtin variable corresponds to the dirs command, however dirs shows the entire contents of the directory stack. $EDITOR The default editor invoked by a script, usually vi or emacs. $EUID &quot;effective&quot; user ID number Identification number of whatever identity the current user has assumed, perhaps by means of su. Caution The $EUID is not necessarily the same as the $UID. $FUNCNAME Name of the current function xyz23 () { echo &quot;$FUNCNAME now executing.&quot; # xyz23 now executing. } xyz23 echo &quot;FUNCNAME = $FUNCNAME&quot; # FUNCNAME = # Null value outside a function. See also Example A-50. $GLOBIGNORE A list of filename patterns to be excluded from matching in globbing. $GROUPS Groups current user belongs to This is a listing (array) of the group id numbers for current user, as recorded in /etc/passwd and /etc/group. root# echo $GROUPS 0 root# echo ${GROUPS[1]} 1 root# echo ${GROUPS[5]} 6 $HOME Home directory of the user, usually /home/username (see Example 10-7) $HOSTNAME The hostname command assigns the system host name at bootup in an init script. However, the gethostname() function sets the Bash internal variable $HOSTNAME. See also Example 10-7. $HOSTTYPE host type Like $MACHTYPE, identifies the system hardware. bash$ echo $HOSTTYPE i686 $IFS internal field separator This variable determines how Bash recognizes fields, or word boundaries, when it interprets character strings. $IFS defaults to whitespace (space, tab, and newline), but may be changed, for example, to parse a comma-separated data file. Note that $* uses the first character held in $IFS. See Example 5-1. bash$ echo &quot;$IFS&quot; (With $IFS set to default, a blank line displays.) bash$ echo &quot;$IFS&quot; | cat -vte ^I$ $ (Show whitespace: here a single space, ^I [horizontal tab], and newline, and display &quot;$&quot; at end-of-line.) bash$ bash -c 'set w x y z; IFS=&quot;:-;&quot;; echo &quot;$*&quot;' w:x:y:z (Read commands from string and assign any arguments to pos params.) Set $IFS to eliminate whitespace in pathnames. IFS=&quot;$(printf '\n\t')&quot; # Per David Wheeler. Caution $IFS does not handle whitespace the same as it does other characters. Example 9-1. $IFS and whitespace #!/bin/bash # ifs.sh var1=&quot;a+b+c&quot; var2=&quot;d-e-f&quot; var3=&quot;g,h,i&quot; IFS=+ # The plus sign will be interpreted as a separator. echo $var1 # a b c echo $var2 # d-e-f echo $var3 # g,h,i echo IFS=&quot;-&quot; # The plus sign reverts to default interpretation. # The minus sign will be interpreted as a separator. echo $var1 # a+b+c echo $var2 # d e f echo $var3 # g,h,i echo IFS=&quot;,&quot; # The comma will be interpreted as a separator. # The minus sign reverts to default interpretation. echo $var1 # a+b+c echo $var2 # d-e-f echo $var3 # g h i echo IFS=&quot; &quot; # The space character will be interpreted as a separator. # The comma reverts to default interpretation. echo $var1 # a+b+c echo $var2 # d-e-f echo $var3 # g,h,i # ======================================================== # # However ... # $IFS treats whitespace differently than other characters. output_args_one_per_line() { for arg do echo &quot;[$arg]&quot; done # ^ ^ Embed within brackets, for your viewing pleasure. } echo; echo &quot;IFS=\&quot; \&quot;&quot; echo &quot;-------&quot; IFS=&quot; &quot; var=&quot; a b c &quot; # ^ ^^ ^^^ output_args_one_per_line $var # output_args_one_per_line `echo &quot; a b c &quot;` # [a] # [b] # [c] echo; echo &quot;IFS=:&quot; echo &quot;-----&quot; IFS=: var=&quot;:a::b:c:::&quot; # Same pattern as above, # ^ ^^ ^^^ #+ but substituting &quot;:&quot; for &quot; &quot; ... output_args_one_per_line $var # [] # [a] # [] # [b] # [c] # [] # [] # Note &quot;empty&quot; brackets. # The same thing happens with the &quot;FS&quot; field separator in awk. echo exit (Many thanks, Stéphane Chazelas, for clarification and above examples.) See also Example 16-41, Example 11-8, and Example 19-14 for instructive examples of using $IFS. $IGNOREEOF Ignore EOF: how many end-of-files (control-D) the shell will ignore before logging out. $LC_COLLATE Often set in the .bashrc or /etc/profile files, this variable controls collation order in filename expansion and pattern matching. If mishandled, LC_COLLATE can cause unexpected results in filename globbing. Note As of version 2.05 of Bash, filename globbing no longer distinguishes between lowercase and uppercase letters in a character range between brackets. For example, ls [A-M]* would match both File1.txt and file1.txt. To revert to the customary behavior of bracket matching, set LC_COLLATE to C by an export LC_COLLATE=C in /etc/profile and/or ~/.bashrc. $LC_CTYPE This internal variable controls character interpretation in globbing and pattern matching. $LINENO This variable is the line number of the shell script in which this variable appears. It has significance only within the script in which it appears, and is chiefly useful for debugging purposes. # *** BEGIN DEBUG BLOCK *** last_cmd_arg=$_ # Save it. echo &quot;At line number $LINENO, variable \&quot;v1\&quot; = $v1&quot; echo &quot;Last command argument processed = $last_cmd_arg&quot; # *** END DEBUG BLOCK *** $MACHTYPE machine type Identifies the system hardware. bash$ echo $MACHTYPE i686 $OLDPWD Old working directory (&quot;OLD-Print-Working-Directory&quot;, previous directory you were in). $OSTYPE operating system type bash$ echo $OSTYPE linux $PATH Path to binaries, usually /usr/bin/, /usr/X11R6/bin/, /usr/local/bin, etc. When given a command, the shell automatically does a hash table search on the directories listed in the path for the executable. The path is stored in the environmental variable, $PATH, a list of directories, separated by colons. Normally, the system stores the $PATH definition in /etc/profile and/or ~/.bashrc (see Appendix H). bash$ echo $PATH /bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin PATH=${PATH}:/opt/bin appends the /opt/bin directory to the current path. In a script, it may be expedient to temporarily add a directory to the path in this way. When the script exits, this restores the original $PATH (a child process, such as a script, may not change the environment of the parent process, the shell). Note The current &quot;working directory&quot;, ./, is usually omitted from the $PATH as a security measure. $PIPESTATUS Array variable holding exit status(es) of last executed foreground pipe. bash$ echo $PIPESTATUS 0 bash$ ls -al | bogus_command bash: bogus_command: command not found bash$ echo ${PIPESTATUS[1]} 127 bash$ ls -al | bogus_command bash: bogus_command: command not found bash$ echo $? 127 The members of the $PIPESTATUS array hold the exit status of each respective command executed in a pipe. $PIPESTATUS[0] holds the exit status of the first command in the pipe, $PIPESTATUS[1] the exit status of the second command, and so on. Caution The $PIPESTATUS variable may contain an erroneous 0 value in a login shell (in releases prior to 3.0 of Bash). tcsh% bash bash$ who | grep nobody | sort bash$ echo ${PIPESTATUS[*]} 0 The above lines contained in a script would produce the expected 0 1 0 output. Thank you, Wayne Pollock for pointing this out and supplying the above example. Note The $PIPESTATUS variable gives unexpected results in some contexts. bash$ echo $BASH_VERSION 3.00.14(1)-release bash$ $ ls | bogus_command | wc bash: bogus_command: command not found 0 0 0 bash$ echo ${PIPESTATUS[@]} 141 127 0 Chet Ramey attributes the above output to the behavior of ls. If ls writes to a pipe whose output is not read, then SIGPIPE kills it, and its exit status is 141. Otherwise its exit status is 0, as expected. This likewise is the case for tr. Note $PIPESTATUS is a &quot;volatile&quot; variable. It needs to be captured immediately after the pipe in question, before any other command intervenes. bash$ $ ls | bogus_command | wc bash: bogus_command: command not found 0 0 0 bash$ echo ${PIPESTATUS[@]} 0 127 0 bash$ echo ${PIPESTATUS[@]} 0 Note The pipefail option may be useful in cases where $PIPESTATUS does not give the desired information. $PPID The $PPID of a process is the process ID (pid) of its parent process. [42] Compare this with the pidof command. $PROMPT_COMMAND A variable holding a command to be executed just before the primary prompt, $PS1 is to be displayed. $PS1 This is the main prompt, seen at the command-line. $PS2 The secondary prompt, seen when additional input is expected. It displays as &quot;&gt;&quot;. $PS3 The tertiary prompt, displayed in a select loop (see Example 11-30). $PS4 The quartenary prompt, shown at the beginning of each line of output when invoking a script with the -x [verbose trace] option. It displays as &quot;+&quot;. As a debugging aid, it may be useful to embed diagnostic information in $PS4. P4='$(read time junk &lt; /proc/$$/schedstat; echo &quot;@@@ $time @@@ &quot; )' # Per suggestion by Erik Brandsberg. set -x # Various commands follow ... $PWD Working directory (directory you are in at the time) This is the analog to the pwd builtin command. #!/bin/bash E_WRONG_DIRECTORY=85 clear # Clear the screen. TargetDirectory=/home/bozo/projects/GreatAmericanNovel cd $TargetDirectory echo &quot;Deleting stale files in $TargetDirectory.&quot; if [ &quot;$PWD&quot; != &quot;$TargetDirectory&quot; ] then # Keep from wiping out wrong directory by accident. echo &quot;Wrong directory!&quot; echo &quot;In $PWD, rather than $TargetDirectory!&quot; echo &quot;Bailing out!&quot; exit $E_WRONG_DIRECTORY fi rm -rf * rm .[A-Za-z0-9]* # Delete dotfiles. # rm -f .[^.]* ..?* to remove filenames beginning with multiple dots. # (shopt -s dotglob; rm -f *) will also work. # Thanks, S.C. for pointing this out. # A filename (`basename`) may contain all characters in the 0 - 255 range, #+ except &quot;/&quot;. # Deleting files beginning with weird characters, such as - #+ is left as an exercise. (Hint: rm ./-weirdname or rm -- -weirdname) result=$? # Result of delete operations. If successful = 0. echo ls -al # Any files left? echo &quot;Done.&quot; echo &quot;Old files deleted in $TargetDirectory.&quot; echo # Various other operations here, as necessary. exit $result $REPLY The default value when a variable is not supplied to read. Also applicable to select menus, but only supplies the item number of the variable chosen, not the value of the variable itself. #!/bin/bash # reply.sh # REPLY is the default value for a 'read' command. echo echo -n &quot;What is your favorite vegetable? &quot; read echo &quot;Your favorite vegetable is $REPLY.&quot; # REPLY holds the value of last &quot;read&quot; if and only if #+ no variable supplied. echo echo -n &quot;What is your favorite fruit? &quot; read fruit echo &quot;Your favorite fruit is $fruit.&quot; echo &quot;but...&quot; echo &quot;Value of \$REPLY is still $REPLY.&quot; # $REPLY is still set to its previous value because #+ the variable $fruit absorbed the new &quot;read&quot; value. echo exit 0 $SECONDS The number of seconds the script has been running. #!/bin/bash TIME_LIMIT=10 INTERVAL=1 echo echo &quot;Hit Control-C to exit before $TIME_LIMIT seconds.&quot; echo while [ &quot;$SECONDS&quot; -le &quot;$TIME_LIMIT&quot; ] do # $SECONDS is an internal shell variable. if [ &quot;$SECONDS&quot; -eq 1 ] then units=second else units=seconds fi echo &quot;This script has been running $SECONDS $units.&quot; # On a slow or overburdened machine, the script may skip a count #+ every once in a while. sleep $INTERVAL done echo -e &quot;\a&quot; # Beep! exit 0 $SHELLOPTS The list of enabled shell options, a readonly variable. bash$ echo $SHELLOPTS braceexpand:hashall:histexpand:monitor:history:interactive-comments:emacs $SHLVL Shell level, how deeply Bash is nested. [43] If, at the command-line, $SHLVL is 1, then in a script it will increment to 2. Note This variable is not affected by subshells. Use $BASH_SUBSHELL when you need an indication of subshell nesting. $TMOUT If the $TMOUT environmental variable is set to a non-zero value time, then the shell prompt will time out after $time seconds. This will cause a logout. As of version 2.05b of Bash, it is now possible to use $TMOUT in a script in combination with read. # Works in scripts for Bash, versions 2.05b and later. TMOUT=3 # Prompt times out at three seconds. echo &quot;What is your favorite song?&quot; echo &quot;Quickly now, you only have $TMOUT seconds to answer!&quot; read song if [ -z &quot;$song&quot; ] then song=&quot;(no answer)&quot; # Default response. fi echo &quot;Your favorite song is $song.&quot; There are other, more complex, ways of implementing timed input in a script. One alternative is to set up a timing loop to signal the script when it times out. This also requires a signal handling routine to trap (see Example 32-5) the interrupt generated by the timing loop (whew!). Example 9-2. Timed Input #!/bin/bash # timed-input.sh # TMOUT=3 Also works, as of newer versions of Bash. TIMER_INTERRUPT=14 TIMELIMIT=3 # Three seconds in this instance. # May be set to different value. PrintAnswer() { if [ &quot;$answer&quot; = TIMEOUT ] then echo $answer else # Don't want to mix up the two instances. echo &quot;Your favorite veggie is $answer&quot; kill $! # Kills no-longer-needed TimerOn function #+ running in background. # $! is PID of last job running in background. fi } TimerOn() { sleep $TIMELIMIT &amp;&amp; kill -s 14 $$ &amp; # Waits 3 seconds, then sends sigalarm to script. } Int14Vector() { answer=&quot;TIMEOUT&quot; PrintAnswer exit $TIMER_INTERRUPT } trap Int14Vector $TIMER_INTERRUPT # Timer interrupt (14) subverted for our purposes. echo &quot;What is your favorite vegetable &quot; TimerOn read answer PrintAnswer # Admittedly, this is a kludgy implementation of timed input. # However, the &quot;-t&quot; option to &quot;read&quot; simplifies this task. # See the &quot;t-out.sh&quot; script. # However, what about timing not just single user input, #+ but an entire script? # If you need something really elegant ... #+ consider writing the application in C or C++, #+ using appropriate library functions, such as 'alarm' and 'setitimer.' exit 0 An alternative is using stty. Example 9-3. Once more, timed input #!/bin/bash # timeout.sh # Written by Stephane Chazelas, #+ and modified by the document author. INTERVAL=5 # timeout interval timedout_read() { timeout=$1 varname=$2 old_tty_settings=`stty -g` stty -icanon min 0 time ${timeout}0 eval read $varname # or just read $varname stty &quot;$old_tty_settings&quot; # See man page for &quot;stty.&quot; } echo; echo -n &quot;What's your name? Quick! &quot; timedout_read $INTERVAL your_name # This may not work on every terminal type. # The maximum timeout depends on the terminal. #+ (it is often 25.5 seconds). echo if [ ! -z &quot;$your_name&quot; ] # If name input before timeout ... then echo &quot;Your name is $your_name.&quot; else echo &quot;Timed out.&quot; fi echo # The behavior of this script differs somewhat from &quot;timed-input.sh.&quot; # At each keystroke, the counter resets. exit 0 Perhaps the simplest method is using the -t option to read. Example 9-4. Timed read #!/bin/bash # t-out.sh [time-out] # Inspired by a suggestion from &quot;syngin seven&quot; (thanks). TIMELIMIT=4 # 4 seconds read -t $TIMELIMIT variable &lt;&amp;1 # ^^^ # In this instance, &quot;&lt;&amp;1&quot; is needed for Bash 1.x and 2.x, # but unnecessary for Bash 3+. echo if [ -z &quot;$variable&quot; ] # Is null? then echo &quot;Timed out, variable still unset.&quot; else echo &quot;variable = $variable&quot; fi exit 0 $UID User ID number Current user's user identification number, as recorded in /etc/passwd This is the current user's real id, even if she has temporarily assumed another identity through su. $UID is a readonly variable, not subject to change from the command line or within a script, and is the counterpart to the id builtin. Example 9-5. Am I root? #!/bin/bash # am-i-root.sh: Am I root or not?

These are, however, often set as environmental variables in one of the Bash or login startup files. $SHELL, the name of the user's login shell, may be set from /etc/passwd or in an &quot;init&quot; script, and it is likewise not a Bash builtin. tcsh% echo $LOGNAME bozo tcsh% echo $SHELL /bin/tcsh tcsh% echo $TERM rxvt bash$ echo $LOGNAME bozo bash$ echo $SHELL /bin/tcsh bash$ echo $TERM rxvt Positional Parameters $0, $1, $2, etc. Positional parameters, passed from command line to script, passed to a function, or set to a variable (see Example 4-5 and Example 15-16) $# Number of command-line arguments [44] or positional parameters (see Example 36-2) $* All of the positional parameters, seen as a single word Note &quot;$*&quot; must be quoted. $@ Same as $*, but each parameter is a quoted string, that is, the parameters are passed on intact, without interpretation or expansion. This means, among other things, that each parameter in the argument list is seen as a separate word. Note Of course, &quot;$@&quot; should be quoted.

The $@ special parameter finds use as a tool for filtering input into shell scripts. The cat &quot;$@&quot; construction accepts input to a script either from stdin or from files given as parameters to the script. See Example 16-24 and Example 16-25. Caution The $* and $@ parameters sometimes display inconsistent and puzzling behavior, depending on the setting of $IFS. Example 9-7. Inconsistent $* and $@ behavior #!/bin/bash # Erratic behavior of the &quot;$*&quot; and &quot;$@&quot; internal Bash variables, #+ depending on whether or not they are quoted. # Demonstrates inconsistent handling of word splitting and linefeeds. set -- &quot;First one&quot; &quot;second&quot; &quot;third:one&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;Fifth: :one&quot; # Setting the script arguments, $1, $2, $3, etc. echo echo 'IFS unchanged, using &quot;$*&quot;' c=0 for i in &quot;$*&quot; # quoted do echo &quot;$((c+=1)): [$i]&quot; # This line remains the same in every instance. # Echo args. done echo --- echo 'IFS unchanged, using $*' c=0 for i in $* # unquoted do echo &quot;$((c+=1)): [$i]&quot; done echo --- echo 'IFS unchanged, using &quot;$@&quot;' c=0 for i in &quot;$@&quot; do echo &quot;$((c+=1)): [$i]&quot; done echo --- echo 'IFS unchanged, using $@' c=0 for i in $@ do echo &quot;$((c+=1)): [$i]&quot; done echo --- IFS=: echo 'IFS=&quot;:&quot;, using &quot;$*&quot;' c=0 for i in &quot;$*&quot; do echo &quot;$((c+=1)): [$i]&quot; done echo --- echo 'IFS=&quot;:&quot;, using $*' c=0 for i in $* do echo &quot;$((c+=1)): [$i]&quot; done echo --- var=$* echo 'IFS=&quot;:&quot;, using &quot;$var&quot; (var=$*)' c=0 for i in &quot;$var&quot; do echo &quot;$((c+=1)): [$i]&quot; done echo --- echo 'IFS=&quot;:&quot;, using $var (var=$*)' c=0 for i in $var do echo &quot;$((c+=1)): [$i]&quot; done echo --- var=&quot;$*&quot; echo 'IFS=&quot;:&quot;, using $var (var=&quot;$*&quot;)' c=0 for i in $var do echo &quot;$((c+=1)): [$i]&quot; done echo --- echo 'IFS=&quot;:&quot;, using &quot;$var&quot; (var=&quot;$*&quot;)' c=0 for i in &quot;$var&quot; do echo &quot;$((c+=1)): [$i]&quot; done echo --- echo 'IFS=&quot;:&quot;, using &quot;$@&quot;' c=0 for i in &quot;$@&quot; do echo &quot;$((c+=1)): [$i]&quot; done echo --- echo 'IFS=&quot;:&quot;, using $@' c=0 for i in $@ do echo &quot;$((c+=1)): [$i]&quot; done echo --- var=$@ echo 'IFS=&quot;:&quot;, using $var (var=$@)' c=0 for i in $var do echo &quot;$((c+=1)): [$i]&quot; done echo --- echo 'IFS=&quot;:&quot;, using &quot;$var&quot; (var=$@)' c=0 for i in &quot;$var&quot; do echo &quot;$((c+=1)): [$i]&quot; done echo --- var=&quot;$@&quot; echo 'IFS=&quot;:&quot;, using &quot;$var&quot; (var=&quot;$@&quot;)' c=0 for i in &quot;$var&quot; do echo &quot;$((c+=1)): [$i]&quot; done echo --- echo 'IFS=&quot;:&quot;, using $var (var=&quot;$@&quot;)' c=0 for i in $var do echo &quot;$((c+=1)): [$i]&quot; done echo # Try this script with ksh or zsh -y. exit 0 # This example script written by Stephane Chazelas, #+ and slightly modified by the document author.

See Example 15-16. Caution This was originally a ksh construct adopted into Bash, and unfortunately it does not seem to work reliably in Bash scripts. One possible use for it is to have a script self-test whether it is interactive. $!

Underscore variable #!/bin/bash echo $_ # /bin/bash # Just called /bin/bash to run the script. # Note that this will vary according to #+ how the script is invoked. du &gt;/dev/null # So no output from command. echo $_ # du ls -al &gt;/dev/null # So no output from command. echo $_ # -al (last argument) : echo $_ # : $? Exit status of a command, function, or the script itself (see Example 24-7) $$ Process ID (PID) of the script itself. [45] The $$ variable often finds use in scripts to construct &quot;unique&quot; temp file names (see Example 32-6, Example 16-31, and Example 15-27). This is usually simpler than invoking mktemp. 9.2. Typing variables: declare or typeset The declare or typeset builtins, which are exact synonyms, permit modifying the properties of variables. This is a very weak form of the typing [46] available in certain programming languages. The declare command is specific to version 2 or later of Bash. The typeset command also works in ksh scripts. declare/typeset options -r readonly (declare -r var1 works the same as readonly var1) This is the rough equivalent of the C const type qualifier. An attempt to change the value of a readonly variable fails with an error message. declare -r var1=1 echo &quot;var1 = $var1&quot; # var1 = 1 (( var1++ )) # x.sh: line 4: var1: readonly variable -i integer declare -i number # The script will treat subsequent occurrences of &quot;number&quot; as an integer. number=3 echo &quot;Number = $number&quot; # Number = 3 number=three echo &quot;Number = $number&quot; # Number = 0 # Tries to evaluate the string &quot;three&quot; as an integer. Certain arithmetic operations are permitted for declared integer variables without the need for expr or let. n=6/3 echo &quot;n = $n&quot; # n = 6/3 declare -i n n=6/3 echo &quot;n = $n&quot; # n = 2 -a array declare -a indices The variable indices will be treated as an array. -f function(s) declare -f A declare -f line with no arguments in a script causes a listing of all the functions previously defined in that script. declare -f function_name A declare -f function_name in a script lists just the function named. -x export declare -x var3 This declares a variable as available for exporting outside the environment of the script itself. -x var=$value declare -x var3=373 The declare command permits assigning a value to a variable in the same statement as setting its properties. Example 9-10. Using declare to type variables #!/bin/bash func1 () { echo This is a function. } declare -f # Lists the function above. echo declare -i var1 # var1 is an integer. var1=2367 echo &quot;var1 declared as $var1&quot; var1=var1+1 # Integer declaration eliminates the need for 'let'. echo &quot;var1 incremented by 1 is $var1.&quot; # Attempt to change variable declared as integer. echo &quot;Attempting to change var1 to floating point value, 2367.1.&quot; var1=2367.1 # Results in error message, with no change to variable. echo &quot;var1 is still $var1&quot; echo declare -r var2=13.36 # 'declare' permits setting a variable property #+ and simultaneously assigning it a value. echo &quot;var2 declared as $var2&quot; # Attempt to change readonly variable. var2=13.37 # Generates error message, and exit from script. echo &quot;var2 is still $var2&quot; # This line will not execute. exit 0 # Script will not exit here. Caution Using the declare builtin restricts the scope of a variable. foo () { FOO=&quot;bar&quot; } bar () { foo echo $FOO } bar # Prints bar. However . . . foo (){ declare FOO=&quot;bar&quot; } bar () { foo echo $FOO } bar # Prints nothing. # Thank you, Michael Iatrou, for pointing this out. 9.2.1. Another use for declare The declare command can be helpful in identifying variables, environmental or otherwise. This can be especially useful with arrays. bash$ declare | grep HOME HOME=/home/bozo bash$ zzy=68 bash$ declare | grep zzy zzy=68 bash$ Colors=([0]=&quot;purple&quot; [1]=&quot;reddish-orange&quot; [2]=&quot;light green&quot;) bash$ echo ${Colors[@]} purple reddish-orange light green bash$ declare | grep Colors Colors=([0]=&quot;purple&quot; [1]=&quot;reddish-orange&quot; [2]=&quot;light green&quot;) 9.3. $RANDOM: generate random integer Anyone who attempts to generate random numbers by deterministic means is, of course, living in a state of sin. --John von Neumann $RANDOM is an internal Bash function (not a constant) that returns a pseudorandom [47] integer in the range 0 - 32767. It should not be used to generate an encryption key. Example 9-11. Generating random numbers #!/bin/bash # $RANDOM returns a different random integer at each invocation. # Nominal range: 0 - 32767 (signed 16-bit integer). MAXCOUNT=10 count=1 echo echo &quot;$MAXCOUNT random numbers:&quot; echo &quot;-----------------&quot; while [ &quot;$count&quot; -le $MAXCOUNT ] # Generate 10 ($MAXCOUNT) random integers. do number=$RANDOM echo $number let &quot;count += 1&quot; # Increment count. done echo &quot;-----------------&quot; # If you need a random int within a certain range, use the 'modulo' operator. # This returns the remainder of a division operation. RANGE=500 echo number=$RANDOM let &quot;number %= $RANGE&quot; # ^^ echo &quot;Random number less than $RANGE --- $number&quot; echo # If you need a random integer greater than a lower bound, #+ then set up a test to discard all numbers below that. FLOOR=200 number=0 #initialize while [ &quot;$number&quot; -le $FLOOR ] do number=$RANDOM done echo &quot;Random number greater than $FLOOR --- $number&quot; echo # Let's examine a simple alternative to the above loop, namely # let &quot;number = $RANDOM + $FLOOR&quot; # That would eliminate the while-loop and run faster. # But, there might be a problem with that. What is it? # Combine above two techniques to retrieve random number between two limits. number=0 #initialize while [ &quot;$number&quot; -le $FLOOR ] do number=$RANDOM let &quot;number %= $RANGE&quot; # Scales $number down within $RANGE. done echo &quot;Random number between $FLOOR and $RANGE --- $number&quot; echo # Generate binary choice, that is, &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; value.

Why or why not? # Tosses each die separately, and so gives correct odds. let &quot;die1 = $RANDOM % $SPOTS +1&quot; # Roll first one. let &quot;die2 = $RANDOM % $SPOTS +1&quot; # Roll second one. # Which arithmetic operation, above, has greater precedence -- #+ modulo (%) or addition (+)? let &quot;throw = $die1 + $die2&quot; echo &quot;Throw of the dice = $throw&quot; echo exit 0 Example 9-12.

MAXTHROWS=600 # Increase this if you have nothing better to do with your time. throw=0 # Number of times the dice have been cast. ones=0 # Must initialize counts to zero, twos=0 #+ since an uninitialized variable is null, NOT zero. threes=0 fours=0 fives=0 sixes=0 print_result () { echo echo &quot;ones = $ones&quot; echo &quot;twos = $twos&quot; echo &quot;threes = $threes&quot; echo &quot;fours = $fours&quot; echo &quot;fives = $fives&quot; echo &quot;sixes = $sixes&quot; echo } update_count() { case &quot;$1&quot; in 0) ((ones++));; # Since a die has no &quot;zero&quot;, this corresponds to 1. 1) ((twos++));; # And this to 2. 2) ((threes++));; # And so forth. 3) ((fours++));; 4) ((fives++));; 5) ((sixes++));; esac } echo while [ &quot;$throw&quot; -lt &quot;$MAXTHROWS&quot; ] do let &quot;die1 = RANDOM % $PIPS&quot; update_count $die1 let &quot;throw += 1&quot; done print_result exit $? # The scores should distribute evenly, assuming RANDOM is random. # With $MAXTHROWS at 600, all should cluster around 100, #+ plus-or-minus 20 or so. # # Keep in mind that RANDOM is a ***pseudorandom*** generator, #+ and not a spectacularly good one at that. # Randomness is a deep and complex subject. # Sufficiently long &quot;random&quot; sequences may exhibit #+ chaotic and other &quot;non-random&quot; behavior. # Exercise (easy): # --------------- # Rewrite this script to flip a coin 1000 times. # Choices are &quot;HEADS&quot; and &quot;TAILS.&quot; As we have seen in the last example, it is best to reseed the RANDOM generator each time it is invoked. Using the same seed for RANDOM repeats the same series of numbers. [48] (This mirrors the behavior of the random() function in C.) Example 9-16. Reseeding RANDOM #!/bin/bash # seeding-random.sh: Seeding the RANDOM variable. # v 1.1, reldate 09 Feb 2013 MAXCOUNT=25 # How many numbers to generate. SEED= random_numbers () { local count=0 local number while [ &quot;$count&quot; -lt &quot;$MAXCOUNT&quot; ] do number=$RANDOM echo -n &quot;$number &quot; let &quot;count++&quot; done } echo; echo SEED=1 RANDOM=$SEED # Setting RANDOM seeds the random number generator. echo &quot;Random seed = $SEED&quot; random_numbers RANDOM=$SEED # Same seed for RANDOM . . . echo; echo &quot;Again, with same random seed ...&quot; echo &quot;Random seed = $SEED&quot; random_numbers # . . . reproduces the exact same number series. # # When is it useful to duplicate a &quot;random&quot; series? echo; echo SEED=2 RANDOM=$SEED # Trying again, but with a different seed . . . echo &quot;Random seed = $SEED&quot; random_numbers # . . . gives a different number series. echo; echo # RANDOM=$$ seeds RANDOM from process id of script. # It is also possible to seed RANDOM from 'time' or 'date' commands. # Getting fancy... SEED=$(head -1 /dev/urandom | od -N 1 | awk '{ print $2 }'| sed s/^0*//) # Pseudo-random output fetched #+ from /dev/urandom (system pseudo-random device-file), #+ then converted to line of printable (octal) numbers by &quot;od&quot;, #+ then &quot;awk&quot; retrieves just one number for SEED, #+ finally &quot;sed&quot; removes any leading zeros. RANDOM=$SEED echo &quot;Random seed = $SEED&quot; random_numbers echo; echo exit 0 Note The /dev/urandom pseudo-device file provides a method of generating much more &quot;random&quot; pseudorandom numbers than the $RANDOM variable. dd if=/dev/urandom of=targetfile bs=1 count=XX creates a file of well-scattered pseudorandom numbers. However, assigning these numbers to a variable in a script requires a workaround, such as filtering through od (as in above example, Example 16-14, and Example A-36), or even piping to md5sum (see Example 36-16). There are also other ways to generate pseudorandom numbers in a script. Awk provides a convenient means of doing this. Example 9-17. Pseudorandom numbers, using awk #!/bin/bash # random2.sh: Returns a pseudorandom number in the range 0 - 1, #+ to 6 decimal places. For example: 0.822725 # Uses the awk rand() function. AWKSCRIPT=' { srand(); print rand() } ' # Command(s)/parameters passed to awk # Note that srand() reseeds awk's random number generator. echo -n &quot;Random number between 0 and 1 = &quot; echo | awk &quot;$AWKSCRIPT&quot; # What happens if you leave out the 'echo'? exit 0 # Exercises: # --------- # 1) Using a loop construct, print out 10 different random numbers. # (Hint: you must reseed the srand() function with a different seed #+ in each pass through the loop. What happens if you omit this?) # 2) Using an integer multiplier as a scaling factor, generate random numbers #+ in the range of 10 to 100. # 3) Same as exercise #2, above, but generate random integers this time. The date command also lends itself to generating pseudorandom integer sequences. Chapter 10. Manipulating Variables 10.1. Manipulating Strings Bash supports a surprising number of string manipulation operations. Unfortunately, these tools lack a unified focus. Some are a subset of parameter substitution, and others fall under the functionality of the UNIX expr command. This results in inconsistent command syntax and overlap of functionality, not to mention confusion. String Length ${#string} expr length $string These are the equivalent of strlen() in C. expr &quot;$string&quot; : '.*' stringZ=abcABC123ABCabc echo ${#stringZ} # 15 echo `expr length $stringZ` # 15 echo `expr &quot;$stringZ&quot; : '.*'` # 15 Example 10-1. Inserting a blank line between paragraphs in a text file #!/bin/bash # paragraph-space.sh # Ver. 2.1, Reldate 29Jul12 [fixup] # Inserts a blank line between paragraphs of a single-spaced text file. # Usage: $0 &lt;FILENAME MINLEN=60 # Change this value?

Ouch! # Thank you, Halim Srama, for pointing this out and suggesting a fix. then echo # Add a blank line immediately fi #+ after a short line terminated by a period. done exit # Exercises: # --------- # 1) The script usually inserts a blank line at the end #+ of the target file. Fix this. # 2) Line 17 only considers periods as sentence terminators. # Modify this to include other common end-of-sentence characters, #+ such as ?, !, and &quot;. Length of Matching Substring at Beginning of String expr match &quot;$string&quot; '$substring' $substring is a regular expression. expr &quot;$string&quot; : '$substring' $substring is a regular expression. stringZ=abcABC123ABCabc # |------| # 12345678 echo `expr match &quot;$stringZ&quot; 'abc[A-Z]*.2'` # 8 echo `expr &quot;$stringZ&quot; : 'abc[A-Z]*.2'` # 8 Index expr index $string $substring Numerical position in $string of first character in $substring that matches. stringZ=abcABC123ABCabc # 123456 ... echo `expr index &quot;$stringZ&quot; C12` # 6 # C position. echo `expr index &quot;$stringZ&quot; 1c` # 3 # 'c' (in #3 position) matches before '1'. This is the near equivalent of strchr() in C. Substring Extraction ${string:position} Extracts substring from $string at $position. If the $string parameter is &quot;*&quot; or &quot;@&quot;, then this extracts the positional parameters, [49] starting at $position. ${string:position:length} Extracts $length characters of substring from $string at $position. stringZ=abcABC123ABCabc # 0123456789..... # 0-based indexing. echo ${stringZ:0} # abcABC123ABCabc echo ${stringZ:1} # bcABC123ABCabc echo ${stringZ:7} # 23ABCabc echo ${stringZ:7:3} # 23A # Three characters of substring. # Is it possible to index from the right end of the string? echo ${stringZ:-4} # abcABC123ABCabc # Defaults to full string, as in ${parameter:-default}. # However . . . echo ${stringZ:(-4)} # Cabc echo ${stringZ: -4} # Cabc # Now, it works. # Parentheses or added space &quot;escape&quot; the position parameter. # Thank you, Dan Jacobson, for pointing this out. The position and length arguments can be &quot;parameterized,&quot; that is, represented as a variable, rather than as a numerical constant. Example 10-2. Generating an 8-character &quot;random&quot; string #!/bin/bash # rand-string.sh # Generating an 8-character &quot;random&quot; string. if [ -n &quot;$1&quot; ] # If command-line argument present, then #+ then set start-string to it. str0=&quot;$1&quot; else # Else use PID of script as start-string. str0=&quot;$$&quot; fi POS=2 # Starting from position 2 in the string.

For example: # Rename all filenames in $PWD with &quot;TXT&quot; suffix to a &quot;txt&quot; suffix. # For example, &quot;file1.TXT&quot; becomes &quot;file1.txt&quot; . . . SUFF=TXT suff=txt for i in $(ls *.$SUFF) do mv -f $i ${i%.$SUFF}.$suff # Leave unchanged everything *except* the shortest pattern match #+ starting from the right-hand-side of the variable $i . . . done ### This could be condensed into a &quot;one-liner&quot; if desired. # Thank you, Rory Winston. ${string%%substring} Deletes longest match of $substring from back of $string. stringZ=abcABC123ABCabc # || shortest # |------------| longest echo ${stringZ%b*c} # abcABC123ABCa # Strip out shortest match between 'b' and 'c', from back of $stringZ. echo ${stringZ%%b*c} # a # Strip out longest match between 'b' and 'c', from back of $stringZ.

Manipulating strings using awk A Bash script may invoke the string manipulation facilities of awk as an alternative to using its built-in operations. Example 10-6. Alternate ways of extracting and locating substrings #!/bin/bash # substring-extraction.sh String=23skidoo1 # 012345678 Bash # 123456789 awk # Note different string indexing system: # Bash numbers first character of string as 0. # Awk numbers first character of string as 1. echo ${String:2:4} # position 3 (0-1-2), 4 characters long # skid # The awk equivalent of ${string:pos:length} is substr(string,pos,length). echo | awk ' { print substr(&quot;'&quot;${String}&quot;'&quot;,3,4) # skid } ' # Piping an empty &quot;echo&quot; to awk gives it dummy input, #+ and thus makes it unnecessary to supply a filename. echo &quot;----&quot; # And likewise: echo | awk ' { print index(&quot;'&quot;${String}&quot;'&quot;, &quot;skid&quot;) # 3 } # (skid starts at position 3) ' # The awk equivalent of &quot;expr index&quot; ... exit 0 10.1.2.

Parameter Substitution Manipulating and/or expanding variables ${parameter} Same as $parameter, i.e., value of the variable parameter. In certain contexts, only the less ambiguous ${parameter} form works. May be used for concatenating variables with strings. your_id=${USER}-on-${HOSTNAME} echo &quot;$your_id&quot; # echo &quot;Old \$PATH = $PATH&quot; PATH=${PATH}:/opt/bin # Add /opt/bin to $PATH for duration of script. echo &quot;New \$PATH = $PATH&quot; ${parameter-default}, ${parameter:-default} If parameter not set, use default. var1=1 var2=2 # var3 is unset. echo ${var1-$var2} # 1 echo ${var3-$var2} # 2 # ^ Note the $ prefix. echo ${username-`whoami`} # Echoes the result of `whoami`, if variable $username is still unset. Note ${parameter-default} and ${parameter:-default} are almost equivalent. The extra : makes a difference only when parameter has been declared, but is null. #!/bin/bash # param-sub.sh # Whether a variable has been declared #+ affects triggering of the default option #+ even if the variable is null. username0= echo &quot;username0 has been declared, but is set to null.&quot; echo &quot;username0 = ${username0-`whoami`}&quot; # Will not echo. echo echo username1 has not been declared. echo &quot;username1 = ${username1-`whoami`}&quot; # Will echo. username2= echo &quot;username2 has been declared, but is set to null.&quot; echo &quot;username2 = ${username2:-`whoami`}&quot; # ^ # Will echo because of :- rather than just - in condition test. # Compare to first instance, above. # # Once again: variable= # variable has been declared, but is set to null. echo &quot;${variable-0}&quot; # (no output) echo &quot;${variable:-1}&quot; # 1 # ^ unset variable echo &quot;${variable-2}&quot; # 2 echo &quot;${variable:-3}&quot; # 3 exit 0 The default parameter construct finds use in providing &quot;missing&quot; command-line arguments in scripts. DEFAULT_FILENAME=generic.data filename=${1:-$DEFAULT_FILENAME} # If not otherwise specified, the following command block operates #+ on the file &quot;generic.data&quot;. # Begin-Command-Block # ... # ... # ... # End-Command-Block # From &quot;hanoi2.bash&quot; example: DISKS=${1:-E_NOPARAM} # Must specify how many disks. # Set $DISKS to $1 command-line-parameter, #+ or to $E_NOPARAM if that is unset. See also Example 3-4, Example 31-2, and Example A-6. Compare this method with using an and list to supply a default command-line argument. ${parameter=default}, ${parameter:=default} If parameter not set, set it to default. Both forms nearly equivalent. The : makes a difference only when $parameter has been declared and is null, [51] as above. echo ${var=abc} # abc echo ${var=xyz} # abc # $var had already been set to abc, so it did not change. ${parameter+alt_value}, ${parameter:+alt_value} If parameter set, use alt_value, else use null string. Both forms nearly equivalent. The : makes a difference only when parameter has been declared and is null, see below. echo &quot;###### \${parameter+alt_value} ########&quot; echo a=${param1+xyz} echo &quot;a = $a&quot; # a = param2= a=${param2+xyz} echo &quot;a = $a&quot; # a = xyz param3=123 a=${param3+xyz} echo &quot;a = $a&quot; # a = xyz echo echo &quot;###### \${parameter:+alt_value} ########&quot; echo a=${param4:+xyz} echo &quot;a = $a&quot; # a = param5= a=${param5:+xyz} echo &quot;a = $a&quot; # a = # Different result from a=${param5+xyz} param6=123 a=${param6:+xyz} echo &quot;a = $a&quot; # a = xyz ${parameter?err_msg}, ${parameter:?err_msg} If parameter set, use it, else print err_msg and abort the script with an exit status of 1. Both forms nearly equivalent. The : makes a difference only when parameter has been declared and is null, as above. Example 10-7. Using parameter substitution and error messages #!/bin/bash # Check some of the system's environmental variables. # This is good preventative maintenance. # If, for example, $USER, the name of the person at the console, is not set, #+ the machine will not recognize you. : ${HOSTNAME?} ${USER?} ${HOME?} ${MAIL?} echo echo &quot;Name of the machine is $HOSTNAME.&quot; echo &quot;You are $USER.&quot; echo &quot;Your home directory is $HOME.&quot; echo &quot;Your mail INBOX is located in $MAIL.&quot; echo echo &quot;If you are reading this message,&quot; echo &quot;critical environmental variables have been set.&quot; echo echo # ------------------------------------------------------ # The ${variablename?} construction can also check #+ for variables set within the script.

Parameter substitution and/or expansion. The following expressions are the complement to the match in expr string operations (see Example 16-9). These particular ones are used mostly in parsing file path names. Variable length / Substring removal ${#var} String length (number of characters in $var). For an array, ${#array} is the length of the first element in the array. Note Exceptions: ${#*} and ${#@} give the number of positional parameters. For an array, ${#array[*]} and ${#array[@]} give the number of elements in the array. Example 10-9.

Loops and Branches What needs this iteration, woman? --Shakespeare, Othello Operations on code blocks are the key to structured and organized shell scripts. Looping and branching constructs provide the tools for accomplishing this. 11.1. Loops A loop is a block of code that iterates [52] a list of commands as long as the loop control condition is true. for loops for arg in [list] This is the basic looping construct. It differs significantly from its C counterpart. for arg in [list] do command(s)... done Note During each pass through the loop, arg takes on the value of each successive variable in the list. for arg in &quot;$var1&quot; &quot;$var2&quot; &quot;$var3&quot; ... &quot;$varN&quot; # In pass 1 of the loop, arg = $var1 # In pass 2 of the loop, arg = $var2 # In pass 3 of the loop, arg = $var3 # ... # In pass N of the loop, arg = $varN # Arguments in [list] quoted to prevent possible word splitting. The argument list may contain wild cards. If do is on same line as for, there needs to be a semicolon after list. for arg in [list] ; do Example 11-1. Simple for loops #!/bin/bash # Listing the planets. for planet in Mercury Venus Earth Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune Pluto do echo $planet # Each planet on a separate line. done echo; echo for planet in &quot;Mercury Venus Earth Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune Pluto&quot; # All planets on same line. # Entire 'list' enclosed in quotes creates a single variable. # Why? Whitespace incorporated into the variable. do echo $planet done echo; echo &quot;Whoops! Pluto is no longer a planet!&quot; exit 0 Each [list] element may contain multiple parameters. This is useful when processing parameters in groups. In such cases, use the set command (see Example 15-16) to force parsing of each [list] element and assignment of each component to the positional parameters. Example 11-2. for loop with two parameters in each [list] element #!/bin/bash # Planets revisited. # Associate the name of each planet with its distance from the sun. for planet in &quot;Mercury 36&quot; &quot;Venus 67&quot; &quot;Earth 93&quot; &quot;Mars 142&quot; &quot;Jupiter 483&quot; do set -- $planet # Parses variable &quot;planet&quot; #+ and sets positional parameters. # The &quot;--&quot; prevents nasty surprises if $planet is null or #+ begins with a dash. # May need to save original positional parameters, #+ since they get overwritten. # One way of doing this is to use an array, # original_params=(&quot;$@&quot;) echo &quot;$1 $2,000,000 miles from the sun&quot; #-------two tabs---concatenate zeroes onto parameter $2 done # (Thanks, S.C., for additional clarification.) exit 0 A variable may supply the [list] in a for loop. Example 11-3. Fileinfo: operating on a file list contained in a variable #!/bin/bash # fileinfo.sh FILES=&quot;/usr/sbin/accept /usr/sbin/pwck /usr/sbin/chroot /usr/bin/fakefile /sbin/badblocks /sbin/ypbind&quot; # List of files you are curious about. # Threw in a dummy file, /usr/bin/fakefile. echo for file in $FILES do if [ ! -e &quot;$file&quot; ] # Check if file exists. then echo &quot;$file does not exist.&quot;; echo continue # On to next. fi ls -l $file | awk '{ print $8 &quot; file size: &quot; $5 }' # Print 2 fields. whatis `basename $file` # File info. # Note that the whatis database needs to have been set up for this to work. # To do this, as root run /usr/bin/makewhatis. echo done exit 0 The [list] in a for loop may be parameterized. Example 11-4. Operating on a parameterized file list #!/bin/bash filename=&quot;*txt&quot; for file in $filename do echo &quot;Contents of $file&quot; echo &quot;---&quot; cat &quot;$file&quot; echo done If the [list] in a for loop contains wild cards (* and ?) used in filename expansion, then globbing takes place. Example 11-5. Operating on files with a for loop #!/bin/bash # list-glob.sh: Generating [list] in a for-loop, using &quot;globbing&quot; ... # Globbing = filename expansion. echo for file in * # ^ Bash performs filename expansion #+ on expressions that globbing recognizes. do ls -l &quot;$file&quot; # Lists all files in $PWD (current directory). # Recall that the wild card character &quot;*&quot; matches every filename, #+ however, in &quot;globbing,&quot; it doesn't match dot-files. # If the pattern matches no file, it is expanded to itself. # To prevent this, set the nullglob option #+ (shopt -s nullglob). # Thanks, S.C. done echo; echo for file in [jx]* do rm -f $file # Removes only files beginning with &quot;j&quot; or &quot;x&quot; in $PWD. echo &quot;Removed file \&quot;$file\&quot;&quot;. done echo exit 0 Omitting the in [list] part of a for loop causes the loop to operate on $@ -- the positional parameters. A particularly clever illustration of this is Example A-15. See also Example 15-17. Example 11-6. Missing in [list] in a for loop #!/bin/bash # Invoke this script both with and without arguments, #+ and see what happens. for a do echo -n &quot;$a &quot; done # The 'in list' missing, therefore the loop operates on '$@' #+ (command-line argument list, including whitespace). echo exit 0 It is possible to use command substitution to generate the [list] in a for loop. See also Example 16-54, Example 11-11 and Example 16-48. Example 11-7. Generating the [list] in a for loop with command substitution #!/bin/bash # for-loopcmd.sh: for-loop with [list] #+ generated by command substitution. NUMBERS=&quot;9 7 3 8 37.53&quot; for number in `echo $NUMBERS` # for number in 9 7 3 8 37.53 do echo -n &quot;$number &quot; done echo exit 0 Here is a somewhat more complex example of using command substitution to create the [list]. Example 11-8. A grep replacement for binary files #!/bin/bash # bin-grep.sh: Locates matching strings in a binary file. # A &quot;grep&quot; replacement for binary files. # Similar effect to &quot;grep -a&quot; E_BADARGS=65 E_NOFILE=66 if [ $# -ne 2 ] then echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` search_string filename&quot; exit $E_BADARGS fi if [ ! -f &quot;$2&quot; ] then echo &quot;File \&quot;$2\&quot; does not exist.&quot; exit $E_NOFILE fi IFS=$'\012' # Per suggestion of Anton Filippov. # was: IFS=&quot;\n&quot; for word in $( strings &quot;$2&quot; | grep &quot;$1&quot; ) # The &quot;strings&quot; command lists strings in binary files. # Output then piped to &quot;grep&quot;, which tests for desired string. do echo $word done # As S.C. points out, lines 23 - 30 could be replaced with the simpler # strings &quot;$2&quot; | grep &quot;$1&quot; | tr -s &quot;$IFS&quot; '[\n*]' # Try something like &quot;./bin-grep.sh mem /bin/ls&quot; #+ to exercise this script. exit 0 More of the same. Example 11-9. Listing all users on the system #!/bin/bash # userlist.sh PASSWORD_FILE=/etc/passwd n=1 # User number for name in $(awk 'BEGIN{FS=&quot;:&quot;}{print $1}' &lt; &quot;$PASSWORD_FILE&quot; ) # Field separator = : ^^^^^^ # Print first field ^^^^^^^^ # Get input from password file /etc/passwd ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ do echo &quot;USER #$n = $name&quot; let &quot;n += 1&quot; done # USER #1 = root # USER #2 = bin # USER #3 = daemon # ... # USER #33 = bozo exit $? # Discussion: # ---------- # How is it that an ordinary user, or a script run by same, #+ can read /etc/passwd? (Hint: Check the /etc/passwd file permissions.) # Is this a security hole? Why or why not? Yet another example of the [list] resulting from command substitution. Example 11-10. Checking all the binaries in a directory for authorship #!/bin/bash # findstring.sh: # Find a particular string in the binaries in a specified directory. directory=/usr/bin/ fstring=&quot;Free Software Foundation&quot; # See which files come from the FSF. for file in $( find $directory -type f -name '*' | sort ) do strings -f $file | grep &quot;$fstring&quot; | sed -e &quot;s%$directory%%&quot; # In the &quot;sed&quot; expression, #+ it is necessary to substitute for the normal &quot;/&quot; delimiter #+ because &quot;/&quot; happens to be one of the characters filtered out. # Failure to do so gives an error message. (Try it.) done exit $? # Exercise (easy): # --------------- # Convert this script to take command-line parameters #+ for $directory and $fstring. A final example of [list] / command substitution, but this time the &quot;command&quot; is a function. generate_list () { echo &quot;one two three&quot; } for word in $(generate_list) # Let &quot;word&quot; grab output of function. do echo &quot;$word&quot; done # one # two # three The output of a for loop may be piped to a command or commands. Example 11-11. Listing the symbolic links in a directory #!/bin/bash # symlinks.sh: Lists symbolic links in a directory. directory=${1-`pwd`} # Defaults to current working directory, #+ if not otherwise specified. # Equivalent to code block below. # ---------------------------------------------------------- # ARGS=1 # Expect one command-line argument. # # if [ $# -ne &quot;$ARGS&quot; ] # If not 1 arg... # then # directory=`pwd` # current working directory # else # directory=$1 # fi # ---------------------------------------------------------- echo &quot;symbolic links in directory \&quot;$directory\&quot;&quot; for file in &quot;$( find $directory -type l )&quot; # -type l = symbolic links do echo &quot;$file&quot; done | sort # Otherwise file list is unsorted. # Strictly speaking, a loop isn't really necessary here, #+ since the output of the &quot;find&quot; command is expanded into a single word. # However, it's easy to understand and illustrative this way. # As Dominik 'Aeneas' Schnitzer points out, #+ failing to quote $( find $directory -type l ) #+ will choke on filenames with embedded whitespace. # containing whitespace. exit 0 # -------------------------------------------------------- # Jean Helou proposes the following alternative: echo &quot;symbolic links in directory \&quot;$directory\&quot;&quot; # Backup of the current IFS. One can never be too cautious. OLDIFS=$IFS IFS=: for file in $(find $directory -type l -printf &quot;%p$IFS&quot;) do # ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ echo &quot;$file&quot; done|sort # And, James &quot;Mike&quot; Conley suggests modifying Helou's code thusly: OLDIFS=$IFS IFS='' # Null IFS means no word breaks for file in $( find $directory -type l ) do echo $file done | sort # This works in the &quot;pathological&quot; case of a directory name having #+ an embedded colon. # &quot;This also fixes the pathological case of the directory name having #+ a colon (or space in earlier example) as well.&quot; The stdout of a loop may be redirected to a file, as this slight modification to the previous example shows. Example 11-12. Symbolic links in a directory, saved to a file #!/bin/bash # symlinks.sh: Lists symbolic links in a directory. OUTFILE=symlinks.list # save-file directory=${1-`pwd`} # Defaults to current working directory, #+ if not otherwise specified. echo &quot;symbolic links in directory \&quot;$directory\&quot;&quot; &gt; &quot;$OUTFILE&quot; echo &quot;---------------------------&quot; &gt;&gt; &quot;$OUTFILE&quot; for file in &quot;$( find $directory -type l )&quot; # -type l = symbolic links do echo &quot;$file&quot; done | sort &gt;&gt; &quot;$OUTFILE&quot; # stdout of loop # ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ redirected to save file. # echo &quot;Output file = $OUTFILE&quot; exit $? There is an alternative syntax to a for loop that will look very familiar to C programmers. This requires double parentheses. Example 11-13. A C-style for loop #!/bin/bash # Multiple ways to count up to 10. echo # Standard syntax. for a in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 do echo -n &quot;$a &quot; done echo; echo # +==========================================+ # Using &quot;seq&quot; ... for a in `seq 10` do echo -n &quot;$a &quot; done echo; echo # +==========================================+ # Using brace expansion ... # Bash, version 3+. for a in {1..10} do echo -n &quot;$a &quot; done echo; echo # +==========================================+ # Now, let's do the same, using C-like syntax. LIMIT=10 for ((a=1; a &lt;= LIMIT ; a++)) # Double parentheses, and naked &quot;LIMIT&quot; do echo -n &quot;$a &quot; done # A construct borrowed from ksh93. echo; echo # +=========================================================================+ # Let's use the C &quot;comma operator&quot; to increment two variables simultaneously. for ((a=1, b=1; a &lt;= LIMIT ; a++, b++)) do # The comma concatenates operations. echo -n &quot;$a-$b &quot; done echo; echo exit 0 See also Example 27-16, Example 27-17, and Example A-6. --- Now, a for loop used in a &quot;real-life&quot; context. Example 11-14. Using efax in batch mode #!/bin/bash # Faxing (must have 'efax' package installed). EXPECTED_ARGS=2 E_BADARGS=85 MODEM_PORT=&quot;/dev/ttyS2&quot; # May be different on your machine. # ^^^^^ PCMCIA modem card default port. if [ $# -ne $EXPECTED_ARGS ] # Check for proper number of command-line args. then echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` phone# text-file&quot; exit $E_BADARGS fi if [ ! -f &quot;$2&quot; ] then echo &quot;File $2 is not a text file.&quot; # File is not a regular file, or does not exist. exit $E_BADARGS fi fax make $2 # Create fax-formatted files from text files. for file in $(ls $2.0*) # Concatenate the converted files. # Uses wild card (filename &quot;globbing&quot;) #+ in variable list. do fil=&quot;$fil $file&quot; done efax -d &quot;$MODEM_PORT&quot; -t &quot;T$1&quot; $fil # Finally, do the work. # Trying adding -o1 if above line fails. # As S.C. points out, the for-loop can be eliminated with # efax -d /dev/ttyS2 -o1 -t &quot;T$1&quot; $2.0* #+ but it's not quite as instructive [grin]. exit $? # Also, efax sends diagnostic messages to stdout. Note The keywords do and done delineate the for-loop command block. However, these may, in certain contexts, be omitted by framing the command block within curly brackets for((n=1; n&lt;=10; n++)) # No do! { echo -n &quot;* $n *&quot; } # No done! # Outputs: # * 1 ** 2 ** 3 ** 4 ** 5 ** 6 ** 7 ** 8 ** 9 ** 10 * # And, echo $? returns 0, so Bash does not register an error. echo # But, note that in a classic for-loop: for n in [list] ... #+ a terminal semicolon is required. for n in 1 2 3 { echo -n &quot;$n &quot;; } # ^ # Thank you, YongYe, for pointing this out. while This construct tests for a condition at the top of a loop, and keeps looping as long as that condition is true (returns a 0 exit status). In contrast to a for loop, a while loop finds use in situations where the number of loop repetitions is not known beforehand. while [ condition ] do command(s)... done The bracket construct in a while loop is nothing more than our old friend, the test brackets used in an if/then test. In fact, a while loop can legally use the more versatile double-brackets construct (while [[ condition ]]). As is the case with for loops, placing the do on the same line as the condition test requires a semicolon. while [ condition ] ; do Note that the test brackets are not mandatory in a while loop. See, for example, the getopts construct. Example 11-15. Simple while loop #!/bin/bash var0=0 LIMIT=10 while [ &quot;$var0&quot; -lt &quot;$LIMIT&quot; ] # ^ ^ # Spaces, because these are &quot;test-brackets&quot; . . . do echo -n &quot;$var0 &quot; # -n suppresses newline. # ^ Space, to separate printed out numbers. var0=`expr $var0 + 1` # var0=$(($var0+1)) also works. # var0=$((var0 + 1)) also works. # let &quot;var0 += 1&quot; also works. done # Various other methods also work. echo exit 0 Example 11-16. Another while loop #!/bin/bash echo # Equivalent to: while [ &quot;$var1&quot; != &quot;end&quot; ] # while test &quot;$var1&quot; != &quot;end&quot; do echo &quot;Input variable #1 (end to exit) &quot; read var1 # Not 'read $var1' (why?). echo &quot;variable #1 = $var1&quot; # Need quotes because of &quot;#&quot; . . . # If input is 'end', echoes it here. # Does not test for termination condition until top of loop. echo done exit 0 A while loop may have multiple conditions. Only the final condition determines when the loop terminates. This necessitates a slightly different loop syntax, however. Example 11-17. while loop with multiple conditions #!/bin/bash var1=unset previous=$var1 while echo &quot;previous-variable = $previous&quot; echo previous=$var1 [ &quot;$var1&quot; != end ] # Keeps track of what $var1 was previously. # Four conditions on *while*, but only the final one controls loop. # The *last* exit status is the one that counts. do echo &quot;Input variable #1 (end to exit) &quot; read var1 echo &quot;variable #1 = $var1&quot; done # Try to figure out how this all works. # It's a wee bit tricky. exit 0 As with a for loop, a while loop may employ C-style syntax by using the double-parentheses construct (see also Example 8-5). Example 11-18. C-style syntax in a while loop #!/bin/bash # wh-loopc.sh: Count to 10 in a &quot;while&quot; loop. LIMIT=10 # 10 iterations. a=1 while [ &quot;$a&quot; -le $LIMIT ] do echo -n &quot;$a &quot; let &quot;a+=1&quot; done # No surprises, so far. echo; echo # +=================================================================+ # Now, we'll repeat with C-like syntax. ((a = 1)) # a=1 # Double parentheses permit space when setting a variable, as in C. while (( a &lt;= LIMIT )) # Double parentheses, do #+ and no &quot;$&quot; preceding variables. echo -n &quot;$a &quot; ((a += 1)) # let &quot;a+=1&quot; # Yes, indeed. # Double parentheses permit incrementing a variable with C-like syntax. done echo # C and Java programmers can feel right at home in Bash. exit 0 Inside its test brackets, a while loop can call a function. t=0 condition () { ((t++)) if [ $t -lt 5 ] then return 0 # true else return 1 # false fi } while condition # ^^^^^^^^^ # Function call -- four loop iterations. do echo &quot;Still going: t = $t&quot; done # Still going: t = 1 # Still going: t = 2 # Still going: t = 3 # Still going: t = 4 Similar to the if-test construct, a while loop can omit the test brackets. while condition do command(s) ... done By coupling the power of the read command with a while loop, we get the handy while read construct, useful for reading and parsing files. cat $filename | # Supply input from a file. while read line # As long as there is another line to read ... do ... done # =========== Snippet from &quot;sd.sh&quot; example script ========== # while read value # Read one data point at a time. do rt=$(echo &quot;scale=$SC; $rt + $value&quot; | bc) (( ct++ )) done am=$(echo &quot;scale=$SC; $rt / $ct&quot; | bc) echo $am; return $ct # This function &quot;returns&quot; TWO values! # Caution: This little trick will not work if $ct &gt; 255! # To handle a larger number of data points, #+ simply comment out the &quot;return $ct&quot; above. } &lt;&quot;$datafile&quot; # Feed in data file. Note A while loop may have its stdin redirected to a file by a &lt; at its end. A while loop may have its stdin supplied by a pipe. until This construct tests for a condition at the top of a loop, and keeps looping as long as that condition is false (opposite of while loop). until [ condition-is-true ] do command(s)... done Note that an until loop tests for the terminating condition at the top of the loop, differing from a similar construct in some programming languages. As is the case with for loops, placing the do on the same line as the condition test requires a semicolon. until [ condition-is-true ] ; do Example 11-19. until loop #!/bin/bash END_CONDITION=end until [ &quot;$var1&quot; = &quot;$END_CONDITION&quot; ] # Tests condition here, at top of loop. do echo &quot;Input variable #1 &quot; echo &quot;($END_CONDITION to exit)&quot; read var1 echo &quot;variable #1 = $var1&quot; echo done # --- # # As with &quot;for&quot; and &quot;while&quot; loops, #+ an &quot;until&quot; loop permits C-like test constructs. LIMIT=10 var=0 until (( var &gt; LIMIT )) do # ^^ ^ ^ ^^ No brackets, no $ prefixing variables. echo -n &quot;$var &quot; (( var++ )) done # 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 exit 0 How to choose between a for loop or a while loop or until loop? In C, you would typically use a for loop when the number of loop iterations is known beforehand. With Bash, however, the situation is fuzzier. The Bash for loop is more loosely structured and more flexible than its equivalent in other languages. Therefore, feel free to use whatever type of loop gets the job done in the simplest way. 11.2. Nested Loops A nested loop is a loop within a loop, an inner loop within the body of an outer one. How this works is that the first pass of the outer loop triggers the inner loop, which executes to completion. Then the second pass of the outer loop triggers the inner loop again. This repeats until the outer loop finishes. Of course, a break within either the inner or outer loop would interrupt this process. Example 11-20. Nested Loop #!/bin/bash # nested-loop.sh: Nested &quot;for&quot; loops. outer=1 # Set outer loop counter. # Beginning of outer loop. for a in 1 2 3 4 5 do echo &quot;Pass $outer in outer loop.&quot; echo &quot;---------------------&quot; inner=1 # Reset inner loop counter. # =============================================== # Beginning of inner loop. for b in 1 2 3 4 5 do echo &quot;Pass $inner in inner loop.&quot; let &quot;inner+=1&quot; # Increment inner loop counter. done # End of inner loop. # =============================================== let &quot;outer+=1&quot; # Increment outer loop counter. echo # Space between output blocks in pass of outer loop. done # End of outer loop. exit 0 See Example 27-11 for an illustration of nested while loops, and Example 27-13 to see a while loop nested inside an until loop. 11.3. Loop Control Tournez cent tours, tournez mille tours, Tournez souvent et tournez toujours . . . --Verlaine, &quot;Chevaux de bois&quot; Commands affecting loop behavior break, continue The break and continue loop control commands [53] correspond exactly to their counterparts in other programming languages. The break command terminates the loop (breaks out of it), while continue causes a jump to the next iteration of the loop, skipping all the remaining commands in that particular loop cycle. Example 11-21. Effects of break and continue in a loop #!/bin/bash LIMIT=19 # Upper limit echo echo &quot;Printing Numbers 1 through 20 (but not 3 and 11).&quot; a=0 while [ $a -le &quot;$LIMIT&quot; ] do a=$(($a+1)) if [ &quot;$a&quot; -eq 3 ] || [ &quot;$a&quot; -eq 11 ] # Excludes 3 and 11. then continue # Skip rest of this particular loop iteration. fi echo -n &quot;$a &quot; # This will not execute for 3 and 11. done # Exercise: # Why does the loop print up to 20? echo; echo echo Printing Numbers 1 through 20, but something happens after 2. ################################################################## # Same loop, but substituting 'break' for 'continue'. a=0 while [ &quot;$a&quot; -le &quot;$LIMIT&quot; ] do a=$(($a+1)) if [ &quot;$a&quot; -gt 2 ] then break # Skip entire rest of loop. fi echo -n &quot;$a &quot; done echo; echo; echo exit 0 The break command may optionally take a parameter. A plain break terminates only the innermost loop in which it is embedded, but a break N breaks out of N levels of loop. Example 11-22. Breaking out of multiple loop levels #!/bin/bash # break-levels.sh: Breaking out of loops. # &quot;break N&quot; breaks out of N level loops. for outerloop in 1 2 3 4 5 do echo -n &quot;Group $outerloop: &quot; # -------------------------------------------------------- for innerloop in 1 2 3 4 5 do echo -n &quot;$innerloop &quot; if [ &quot;$innerloop&quot; -eq 3 ] then break # Try break 2 to see what happens. # (&quot;Breaks&quot; out of both inner and outer loops.) fi done # -------------------------------------------------------- echo done echo exit 0 The continue command, similar to break, optionally takes a parameter. A plain continue cuts short the current iteration within its loop and begins the next. A continue N terminates all remaining iterations at its loop level and continues with the next iteration at the loop, N levels above. Example 11-23. Continuing at a higher loop level #!/bin/bash # The &quot;continue N&quot; command, continuing at the Nth level loop. for outer in I II III IV V # outer loop do echo; echo -n &quot;Group $outer: &quot; # -------------------------------------------------------------------- for inner in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 # inner loop do if [[ &quot;$inner&quot; -eq 7 &amp;&amp; &quot;$outer&quot; = &quot;III&quot; ]] then continue 2 # Continue at loop on 2nd level, that is &quot;outer loop&quot;. # Replace above line with a simple &quot;continue&quot; # to see normal loop behavior. fi echo -n &quot;$inner &quot; # 7 8 9 10 will not echo on &quot;Group III.&quot; done # -------------------------------------------------------------------- done echo; echo # Exercise: # Come up with a meaningful use for &quot;continue N&quot; in a script. exit 0 Example 11-24. Using continue N in an actual task # Albert Reiner gives an example of how to use &quot;continue N&quot;: # --------------------------------------------------------- # Suppose I have a large number of jobs that need to be run, with #+ any data that is to be treated in files of a given name pattern #+ in a directory. There are several machines that access #+ this directory, and I want to distribute the work over these #+ different boxen. # Then I usually nohup something like the following on every box: while true do for n in .iso.* do [ &quot;$n&quot; = &quot;.iso.opts&quot; ] &amp;&amp; continue beta=${n#.iso.} [ -r .Iso.$beta ] &amp;&amp; continue [ -r .lock.$beta ] &amp;&amp; sleep 10 &amp;&amp; continue lockfile -r0 .lock.$beta || continue echo -n &quot;$beta: &quot; `date` run-isotherm $beta date ls -alF .Iso.$beta [ -r .Iso.$beta ] &amp;&amp; rm -f .lock.$beta continue 2 done break done exit 0 # The details, in particular the sleep N, are particular to my #+ application, but the general pattern is: while true do for job in {pattern} do {job already done or running} &amp;&amp; continue {mark job as running, do job, mark job as done} continue 2 done break # Or something like `sleep 600' to avoid termination. done # This way the script will stop only when there are no more jobs to do #+ (including jobs that were added during runtime). Through the use #+ of appropriate lockfiles it can be run on several machines #+ concurrently without duplication of calculations [which run a couple #+ of hours in my case, so I really want to avoid this]. Also, as search #+ always starts again from the beginning, one can encode priorities in #+ the file names. Of course, one could also do this without `continue 2', #+ but then one would have to actually check whether or not some job #+ was done (so that we should immediately look for the next job) or not #+ (in which case we terminate or sleep for a long time before checking #+ for a new job). Caution The continue N construct is difficult to understand and tricky to use in any meaningful context. It is probably best avoided. 11.4. Testing and Branching The case and select constructs are technically not loops, since they do not iterate the execution of a code block. Like loops, however, they direct program flow according to conditions at the top or bottom of the block. Controlling program flow in a code block case (in) / esac The case construct is the shell scripting analog to switch in C/C++. It permits branching to one of a number of code blocks, depending on condition tests. It serves as a kind of shorthand for multiple if/then/else statements and is an appropriate tool for creating menus. case &quot;$variable&quot; in &quot;$condition1&quot; ) command... ;; &quot;$condition2&quot; ) command... ;; esac Note Quoting the variables is not mandatory, since word splitting does not take place. Each test line ends with a right paren ). [54] Each condition block ends with a double semicolon ;;. If a condition tests true, then the associated commands execute and the case block terminates. The entire case block ends with an esac (case spelled backwards). Example 11-25. Using case #!/bin/bash # Testing ranges of characters. echo; echo &quot;Hit a key, then hit return.&quot; read Keypress case &quot;$Keypress&quot; in [[:lower:]] ) echo &quot;Lowercase letter&quot;;; [[:upper:]] ) echo &quot;Uppercase letter&quot;;; [0-9] ) echo &quot;Digit&quot;;; * ) echo &quot;Punctuation, whitespace, or other&quot;;; esac # Allows ranges of characters in [square brackets], #+ or POSIX ranges in [[double square brackets. # In the first version of this example, #+ the tests for lowercase and uppercase characters were #+ [a-z] and [A-Z]. # This no longer works in certain locales and/or Linux distros. # POSIX is more portable. # Thanks to Frank Wang for pointing this out. # Exercise: # -------- # As the script stands, it accepts a single keystroke, then terminates. # Change the script so it accepts repeated input, #+ reports on each keystroke, and terminates only when &quot;X&quot; is hit. # Hint: enclose everything in a &quot;while&quot; loop. exit 0 Example 11-26.

Chapter 12. Command Substitution Command substitution reassigns the output of a command [55] or even multiple commands; it literally plugs the command output into another context. [56] The classic form of command substitution uses backquotes (`...`). Commands within backquotes (backticks) generate command-line text. script_name=`basename $0` echo &quot;The name of this script is $script_name.&quot; The output of commands can be used as arguments to another command, to set a variable, and even for generating the argument list in a for loop. rm `cat filename` # &quot;filename&quot; contains a list of files to delete. # # S. C. points out that &quot;arg list too long&quot; error might result. # Better is xargs rm -- &lt; filename # ( -- covers those cases where &quot;filename&quot; begins with a &quot;-&quot; ) textfile_listing=`ls *.txt` # Variable contains names of all *.txt files in current working directory. echo $textfile_listing textfile_listing2=$(ls *.txt) # The alternative form of command substitution. echo $textfile_listing2 # Same result. # A possible problem with putting a list of files into a single string # is that a newline may creep in. # # A safer way to assign a list of files to a parameter is with an array. # shopt -s nullglob # If no match, filename expands to nothing. # textfile_listing=( *.txt ) # # Thanks, S.C. Note Command substitution invokes a subshell. Caution Command substitution may result in word splitting. COMMAND `echo a b` # 2 args: a and b COMMAND &quot;`echo a b`&quot; # 1 arg: &quot;a b&quot; COMMAND `echo` # no arg COMMAND &quot;`echo`&quot; # one empty arg # Thanks, S.C. Even when there is no word splitting, command substitution can remove trailing newlines. # cd &quot;`pwd`&quot; # This should always work. # However... mkdir 'dir with trailing newline ' cd 'dir with trailing newline ' cd &quot;`pwd`&quot; # Error message: # bash: cd: /tmp/file with trailing newline: No such file or directory cd &quot;$PWD&quot; # Works fine. old_tty_setting=$(stty -g) # Save old terminal setting. echo &quot;Hit a key &quot; stty -icanon -echo # Disable &quot;canonical&quot; mode for terminal. # Also, disable *local* echo. key=$(dd bs=1 count=1 2&gt; /dev/null) # Using 'dd' to get a keypress. stty &quot;$old_tty_setting&quot; # Restore old setting. echo &quot;You hit ${#key} key.&quot; # ${#variable} = number of characters in $variable # # Hit any key except RETURN, and the output is &quot;You hit 1 key.&quot; # Hit RETURN, and it's &quot;You hit 0 key.&quot; # The newline gets eaten in the command substitution. #Code snippet by Stéphane Chazelas. Caution Using echo to output an unquoted variable set with command substitution removes trailing newlines characters from the output of the reassigned command(s). This can cause unpleasant surprises. dir_listing=`ls -l` echo $dir_listing # unquoted # Expecting a nicely ordered directory listing. # However, what you get is: # total 3 -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 30 May 13 17:15 1.txt -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo # bozo 51 May 15 20:57 t2.sh -rwxr-xr-x 1 bozo bozo 217 Mar 5 21:13 wi.sh # The newlines disappeared. echo &quot;$dir_listing&quot; # quoted # -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo 30 May 13 17:15 1.txt # -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo 51 May 15 20:57 t2.sh # -rwxr-xr-x 1 bozo 217 Mar 5 21:13 wi.sh Command substitution even permits setting a variable to the contents of a file, using either redirection or the cat command. variable1=`&lt;file1` # Set &quot;variable1&quot; to contents of &quot;file1&quot;. variable2=`cat file2` # Set &quot;variable2&quot; to contents of &quot;file2&quot;. # This, however, forks a new process, #+ so the line of code executes slower than the above version. # Note that the variables may contain embedded whitespace, #+ or even (horrors), control characters. # It is not necessary to explicitly assign a variable. echo &quot;` &lt;$0`&quot; # Echoes the script itself to stdout. # Excerpts from system file, /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit #+ (on a Red Hat Linux installation) if [ -f /fsckoptions ]; then fsckoptions=`cat /fsckoptions` ... fi # # if [ -e &quot;/proc/ide/${disk[$device]}/media&quot; ] ; then hdmedia=`cat /proc/ide/${disk[$device]}/media` ... fi # # if [ ! -n &quot;`uname -r | grep -- &quot;-&quot;`&quot; ]; then ktag=&quot;`cat /proc/version`&quot; ... fi # # if [ $usb = &quot;1&quot; ]; then sleep 5 mouseoutput=`cat /proc/bus/usb/devices 2&gt;/dev/null|grep -E &quot;^I.*Cls=03.*Prot=02&quot;` kbdoutput=`cat /proc/bus/usb/devices 2&gt;/dev/null|grep -E &quot;^I.*Cls=03.*Prot=01&quot;` ... fi Caution Do not set a variable to the contents of a long text file unless you have a very good reason for doing so. Do not set a variable to the contents of a binary file, even as a joke. Example 12-1. Stupid script tricks #!/bin/bash # stupid-script-tricks.sh: Don't try this at home, folks. # From &quot;Stupid Script Tricks,&quot; Volume I. exit 99 ### Comment out this line if you dare. dangerous_variable=`cat /boot/vmlinuz` # The compressed Linux kernel itself. echo &quot;string-length of \$dangerous_variable = ${#dangerous_variable}&quot; # string-length of $dangerous_variable = 794151 # (Newer kernels are bigger.) # Does not give same count as 'wc -c /boot/vmlinuz'. # echo &quot;$dangerous_variable&quot; # Don't try this! It would hang the script. # The document author is aware of no useful applications for #+ setting a variable to the contents of a binary file. exit 0 Notice that a buffer overrun does not occur. This is one instance where an interpreted language, such as Bash, provides more protection from programmer mistakes than a compiled language. Command substitution permits setting a variable to the output of a loop. The key to this is grabbing the output of an echo command within the loop. Example 12-2. Generating a variable from a loop #!/bin/bash # csubloop.sh: Setting a variable to the output of a loop. variable1=`for i in 1 2 3 4 5 do echo -n &quot;$i&quot; # The 'echo' command is critical done` #+ to command substitution here. echo &quot;variable1 = $variable1&quot; # variable1 = 12345 i=0 variable2=`while [ &quot;$i&quot; -lt 10 ] do echo -n &quot;$i&quot; # Again, the necessary 'echo'. let &quot;i += 1&quot; # Increment. done` echo &quot;variable2 = $variable2&quot; # variable2 = 0123456789 # Demonstrates that it's possible to embed a loop #+ inside a variable declaration. exit 0 Command substitution makes it possible to extend the toolset available to Bash. It is simply a matter of writing a program or script that outputs to stdout (like a well-behaved UNIX tool should) and assigning that output to a variable. #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; /* &quot;Hello, world.&quot; C program */ int main() { printf( &quot;Hello, world.\n&quot; ); return (0); } bash$ gcc -o hello hello.c #!/bin/bash # hello.sh greeting=`./hello` echo $greeting bash$ sh hello.sh Hello, world. Note The $(...) form has superseded backticks for command substitution. output=$(sed -n /&quot;$1&quot;/p $file) # From &quot;grp.sh&quot; example. # Setting a variable to the contents of a text file. File_contents1=$(cat $file1) File_contents2=$(&lt;$file2) # Bash permits this also.

Arithmetic Expansion Arithmetic expansion provides a powerful tool for performing (integer) arithmetic operations in scripts. Translating a string into a numerical expression is relatively straightforward using backticks, double parentheses, or let. Variations Arithmetic expansion with backticks (often used in conjunction with expr) z=`expr $z + 3` # The 'expr' command performs the expansion. Arithmetic expansion with double parentheses, and using let The use of backticks (backquotes) in arithmetic expansion has been superseded by double parentheses -- ((...)) and $((...)) -- and also by the very convenient let construction. z=$(($z+3)) z=$((z+3)) # Also correct. # Within double parentheses, #+ parameter dereferencing #+ is optional. # $((EXPRESSION)) is arithmetic expansion. # Not to be confused with #+ command substitution. # You may also use operations within double parentheses without assignment. n=0 echo &quot;n = $n&quot; # n = 0 (( n += 1 )) # Increment. # (( $n += 1 )) is incorrect! echo &quot;n = $n&quot; # n = 1 let z=z+3 let &quot;z += 3&quot; # Quotes permit the use of spaces in variable assignment. # The 'let' operator actually performs arithmetic evaluation, #+ rather than expansion.

System and Administrative Commands 17.1. Analyzing a System Script Chapter 15. Internal Commands and Builtins A builtin is a command contained within the Bash tool set, literally built in. This is either for performance reasons -- builtins execute faster than external commands, which usually require forking off [58] a separate process -- or because a particular builtin needs direct access to the shell internals. When a command or the shell itself initiates (or spawns) a new subprocess to carry out a task, this is called forking. This new process is the child, and the process that forked it off is the parent. While the child process is doing its work, the parent process is still executing. Note that while a parent process gets the process ID of the child process, and can thus pass arguments to it, the reverse is not true. This can create problems that are subtle and hard to track down. Example 15-1. A script that spawns multiple instances of itself #!/bin/bash # spawn.sh PIDS=$(pidof sh $0) # Process IDs of the various instances of this script. P_array=( $PIDS ) # Put them in an array (why?). echo $PIDS # Show process IDs of parent and child processes. let &quot;instances = ${#P_array[*]} - 1&quot; # Count elements, less 1. # Why subtract 1? echo &quot;$instances instance(s) of this script running.&quot; echo &quot;[Hit Ctl-C to exit.]&quot;; echo sleep 1 # Wait. sh $0 # Play it again, Sam. exit 0 # Not necessary; script will never get to here. # Why not? # After exiting with a Ctl-C, #+ do all the spawned instances of the script die? # If so, why? # Note: # ---- # Be careful not to run this script too long. # It will eventually eat up too many system resources. # Is having a script spawn multiple instances of itself #+ an advisable scripting technique. # Why or why not? Generally, a Bash builtin does not fork a subprocess when it executes within a script. An external system command or filter in a script usually will fork a subprocess. A builtin may be a synonym to a system command of the same name, but Bash reimplements it internally. For example, the Bash echo command is not the same as /bin/echo, although their behavior is almost identical. #!/bin/bash echo &quot;This line uses the \&quot;echo\&quot; builtin.&quot; /bin/echo &quot;This line uses the /bin/echo system command.&quot; A keyword is a reserved word, token or operator. Keywords have a special meaning to the shell, and indeed are the building blocks of the shell's syntax. As examples, for, while, do, and ! are keywords. Similar to a builtin, a keyword is hard-coded into Bash, but unlike a builtin, a keyword is not in itself a command, but a subunit of a command construct. [59] I/O echo prints (to stdout) an expression or variable (see Example 4-1). echo Hello echo $a An echo requires the -e option to print escaped characters. See Example 5-2. Normally, each echo command prints a terminal newline, but the -n option suppresses this. Note An echo can be used to feed a sequence of commands down a pipe. if echo &quot;$VAR&quot; | grep -q txt # if [[ $VAR = *txt* ]] then echo &quot;$VAR contains the substring sequence \&quot;txt\&quot;&quot; fi Note An echo, in combination with command substitution can set a variable. a=`echo &quot;HELLO&quot; | tr A-Z a-z` See also Example 16-22, Example 16-3, Example 16-47, and Example 16-48. Be aware that echo `command` deletes any linefeeds that the output of command generates. The $IFS (internal field separator) variable normally contains \n (linefeed) as one of its set of whitespace characters. Bash therefore splits the output of command at linefeeds into arguments to echo. Then echo outputs these arguments, separated by spaces. bash$ ls -l /usr/share/apps/kjezz/sounds -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1407 Nov 7 2000 reflect.au -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 362 Nov 7 2000 seconds.au bash$ echo `ls -l /usr/share/apps/kjezz/sounds` total 40 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 716 Nov 7 2000 reflect.au -rw-r--r-- 1 root root ... So, how can we embed a linefeed within an echoed character string? # Embedding a linefeed? echo &quot;Why doesn't this string \n split on two lines?&quot; # Doesn't split. # Let's try something else. echo echo $&quot;A line of text containing a linefeed.&quot; # Prints as two distinct lines (embedded linefeed). # But, is the &quot;$&quot; variable prefix really necessary? echo echo &quot;This string splits on two lines.&quot; # No, the &quot;$&quot; is not needed. echo echo &quot;---------------&quot; echo echo -n $&quot;Another line of text containing a linefeed.&quot; # Prints as two distinct lines (embedded linefeed). # Even the -n option fails to suppress the linefeed here. echo echo echo &quot;---------------&quot; echo echo # However, the following doesn't work as expected. # Why not? Hint: Assignment to a variable. string1=$&quot;Yet another line of text containing a linefeed (maybe).&quot; echo $string1 # Yet another line of text containing a linefeed (maybe). # ^ # Linefeed becomes a space. # Thanks, Steve Parker, for pointing this out. Note This command is a shell builtin, and not the same as /bin/echo, although its behavior is similar. bash$ type -a echo echo is a shell builtin echo is /bin/echo printf The printf, formatted print, command is an enhanced echo. It is a limited variant of the C language printf() library function, and its syntax is somewhat different. printf format-string... parameter... This is the Bash builtin version of the /bin/printf or /usr/bin/printf command. See the printf manpage (of the system command) for in-depth coverage. Caution Older versions of Bash may not support printf. Example 15-2. printf in action #!/bin/bash # printf demo declare -r PI=3.14159265358979 # Read-only variable, i.e., a constant. declare -r DecimalConstant=31373 Message1=&quot;Greetings,&quot; Message2=&quot;Earthling.&quot; echo printf &quot;Pi to 2 decimal places = %1.2f&quot; $PI echo printf &quot;Pi to 9 decimal places = %1.9f&quot; $PI # It even rounds off correctly. printf &quot;\n&quot; # Prints a line feed, # Equivalent to 'echo' . . . printf &quot;Constant = \t%d\n&quot; $DecimalConstant # Inserts tab (\t). printf &quot;%s %s \n&quot; $Message1 $Message2 echo # ==========================================# # Simulation of C function, sprintf(). # Loading a variable with a formatted string. echo Pi12=$(printf &quot;%1.12f&quot; $PI) echo &quot;Pi to 12 decimal places = $Pi12&quot; # Roundoff error! Msg=`printf &quot;%s %s \n&quot; $Message1 $Message2` echo $Msg; echo $Msg # As it happens, the 'sprintf' function can now be accessed #+ as a loadable module to Bash, #+ but this is not portable. exit 0 Formatting error messages is a useful application of printf E_BADDIR=85 var=nonexistent_directory error() { printf &quot;$@&quot; &gt;&amp;2 # Formats positional params passed, and sends them to stderr. echo exit $E_BADDIR } cd $var || error $&quot;Can't cd to %s.&quot; &quot;$var&quot; # Thanks, S.C. See also Example 36-17. read &quot;Reads&quot; the value of a variable from stdin, that is, interactively fetches input from the keyboard. The -a option lets read get array variables (see Example 27-6). Example 15-3. Variable assignment, using read #!/bin/bash # &quot;Reading&quot; variables. echo -n &quot;Enter the value of variable 'var1': &quot; # The -n option to echo suppresses newline. read var1 # Note no '$' in front of var1, since it is being set. echo &quot;var1 = $var1&quot; echo # A single 'read' statement can set multiple variables. echo -n &quot;Enter the values of variables 'var2' and 'var3' &quot; echo =n &quot;(separated by a space or tab): &quot; read var2 var3 echo &quot;var2 = $var2 var3 = $var3&quot; # If you input only one value, #+ the other variable(s) will remain unset (null). exit 0 A read without an associated variable assigns its input to the dedicated variable $REPLY. Example 15-4. What happens when read has no variable #!/bin/bash # read-novar.sh echo # -------------------------- # echo -n &quot;Enter a value: &quot; read var echo &quot;\&quot;var\&quot; = &quot;$var&quot;&quot; # Everything as expected here. # -------------------------- # echo # ------------------------------------------------------------------- # echo -n &quot;Enter another value: &quot; read # No variable supplied for 'read', therefore... #+ Input to 'read' assigned to default variable, $REPLY. var=&quot;$REPLY&quot; echo &quot;\&quot;var\&quot; = &quot;$var&quot;&quot; # This is equivalent to the first code block. # ------------------------------------------------------------------- # echo echo &quot;=========================&quot; echo # This example is similar to the &quot;reply.sh&quot; script. # However, this one shows that $REPLY is available #+ even after a 'read' to a variable in the conventional way. # ================================================================= # # In some instances, you might wish to discard the first value read. # In such cases, simply ignore the $REPLY variable. { # Code block. read # Line 1, to be discarded. read line2 # Line 2, saved in variable. } &lt;$0 echo &quot;Line 2 of this script is:&quot; echo &quot;$line2&quot; # # read-novar.sh echo # #!/bin/bash line discarded. # See also the soundcard-on.sh script. exit 0 Normally, inputting a \ suppresses a newline during input to a read. The -r option causes an inputted \ to be interpreted literally. Example 15-5. Multi-line input to read #!/bin/bash echo echo &quot;Enter a string terminated by a \\, then press &lt;ENTER&gt;.&quot; echo &quot;Then, enter a second string (no \\ this time), and again press &lt;ENTER&gt;.&quot; read var1 # The &quot;\&quot; suppresses the newline, when reading $var1. # first line \ # second line echo &quot;var1 = $var1&quot; # var1 = first line second line # For each line terminated by a &quot;\&quot; #+ you get a prompt on the next line to continue feeding characters into var1. echo; echo echo &quot;Enter another string terminated by a \\ , then press &lt;ENTER&gt;.&quot; read -r var2 # The -r option causes the &quot;\&quot; to be read literally. # first line \ echo &quot;var2 = $var2&quot; # var2 = first line \ # Data entry terminates with the first &lt;ENTER&gt;. echo exit 0 The read command has some interesting options that permit echoing a prompt and even reading keystrokes without hitting ENTER. # Read a keypress without hitting ENTER. read -s -n1 -p &quot;Hit a key &quot; keypress echo; echo &quot;Keypress was &quot;\&quot;$keypress\&quot;&quot;.&quot; # -s option means do not echo input. # -n N option means accept only N characters of input. # -p option means echo the following prompt before reading input. # Using these options is tricky, since they need to be in the correct order. The -n option to read also allows detection of the arrow keys and certain of the other unusual keys. Example 15-6. Detecting the arrow keys #!/bin/bash # arrow-detect.sh: Detects the arrow keys, and a few more. # Thank you, Sandro Magi, for showing me how. # -------------------------------------------- # Character codes generated by the keypresses. arrowup='\[A' arrowdown='\[B' arrowrt='\[C' arrowleft='\[D' insert='\[2' delete='\[3' # -------------------------------------------- SUCCESS=0 OTHER=65 echo -n &quot;Press a key... &quot; # May need to also press ENTER if a key not listed above pressed. read -n3 key # Read 3 characters. echo -n &quot;$key&quot; | grep &quot;$arrowup&quot; #Check if character code detected. if [ &quot;$?&quot; -eq $SUCCESS ] then echo &quot;Up-arrow key pressed.&quot; exit $SUCCESS fi echo -n &quot;$key&quot; | grep &quot;$arrowdown&quot; if [ &quot;$?&quot; -eq $SUCCESS ] then echo &quot;Down-arrow key pressed.&quot; exit $SUCCESS fi echo -n &quot;$key&quot; | grep &quot;$arrowrt&quot; if [ &quot;$?&quot; -eq $SUCCESS ] then echo &quot;Right-arrow key pressed.&quot; exit $SUCCESS fi echo -n &quot;$key&quot; | grep &quot;$arrowleft&quot; if [ &quot;$?&quot; -eq $SUCCESS ] then echo &quot;Left-arrow key pressed.&quot; exit $SUCCESS fi echo -n &quot;$key&quot; | grep &quot;$insert&quot; if [ &quot;$?&quot; -eq $SUCCESS ] then echo &quot;\&quot;Insert\&quot; key pressed.&quot; exit $SUCCESS fi echo -n &quot;$key&quot; | grep &quot;$delete&quot; if [ &quot;$?&quot; -eq $SUCCESS ] then echo &quot;\&quot;Delete\&quot; key pressed.&quot; exit $SUCCESS fi echo &quot; Some other key pressed.&quot; exit $OTHER # ========================================= # # Mark Alexander came up with a simplified #+ version of the above script (Thank you!). # It eliminates the need for grep. #!/bin/bash uparrow=$'\x1b[A' downarrow=$'\x1b[B' leftarrow=$'\x1b[D' rightarrow=$'\x1b[C' read -s -n3 -p &quot;Hit an arrow key: &quot; x case &quot;$x&quot; in $uparrow) echo &quot;You pressed up-arrow&quot; ;; $downarrow) echo &quot;You pressed down-arrow&quot; ;; $leftarrow) echo &quot;You pressed left-arrow&quot; ;; $rightarrow) echo &quot;You pressed right-arrow&quot; ;; esac exit $? # ========================================= # # Antonio Macchi has a simpler alternative. #!/bin/bash while true do read -sn1 a test &quot;$a&quot; == `echo -en &quot;\e&quot;` || continue read -sn1 a test &quot;$a&quot; == &quot;[&quot; || continue read -sn1 a case &quot;$a&quot; in A) echo &quot;up&quot;;; B) echo &quot;down&quot;;; C) echo &quot;right&quot;;; D) echo &quot;left&quot;;; esac done # ========================================= # # Exercise: # -------- # 1) Add detection of the &quot;Home,&quot; &quot;End,&quot; &quot;PgUp,&quot; and &quot;PgDn&quot; keys. Note The -n option to read will not detect the ENTER (newline) key. The -t option to read permits timed input (see Example 9-4 and Example A-41). The -u option takes the file descriptor of the target file. The read command may also &quot;read&quot; its variable value from a file redirected to stdin. If the file contains more than one line, only the first line is assigned to the variable. If read has more than one parameter, then each of these variables gets assigned a successive whitespace-delineated string. Caution! Example 15-7. Using read with file redirection #!/bin/bash read var1 &lt;data-file echo &quot;var1 = $var1&quot; # var1 set to the entire first line of the input file &quot;data-file&quot; read var2 var3 &lt;data-file echo &quot;var2 = $var2 var3 = $var3&quot; # Note non-intuitive behavior of &quot;read&quot; here. # 1) Rewinds back to the beginning of input file. # 2) Each variable is now set to a corresponding string, # separated by whitespace, rather than to an entire line of text. # 3) The final variable gets the remainder of the line. # 4) If there are more variables to be set than whitespace-terminated strings # on the first line of the file, then the excess variables remain empty. echo &quot;------------------------------------------------&quot; # How to resolve the above problem with a loop: while read line do echo &quot;$line&quot; done &lt;data-file # Thanks, Heiner Steven for pointing this out. echo &quot;------------------------------------------------&quot; # Use $IFS (Internal Field Separator variable) to split a line of input to # &quot;read&quot;, if you do not want the default to be whitespace. echo &quot;List of all users:&quot; OIFS=$IFS; IFS=: # /etc/passwd uses &quot;:&quot; for field separator. while read name passwd uid gid fullname ignore do echo &quot;$name ($fullname)&quot; done &lt;/etc/passwd # I/O redirection. IFS=$OIFS # Restore original $IFS. # This code snippet also by Heiner Steven. # Setting the $IFS variable within the loop itself #+ eliminates the need for storing the original $IFS #+ in a temporary variable. # Thanks, Dim Segebart, for pointing this out. echo &quot;------------------------------------------------&quot; echo &quot;List of all users:&quot; while IFS=: read name passwd uid gid fullname ignore do echo &quot;$name ($fullname)&quot; done &lt;/etc/passwd # I/O redirection. echo echo &quot;\$IFS still $IFS&quot; exit 0 Note Piping output to a read, using echo to set variables will fail. Yet, piping the output of cat seems to work. cat file1 file2 | while read line do echo $line done However, as Bjön Eriksson shows: Example 15-8. Problems reading from a pipe #!/bin/sh # readpipe.sh # This example contributed by Bjon Eriksson. ### shopt -s lastpipe last=&quot;(null)&quot; cat $0 | while read line do echo &quot;{$line}&quot; last=$line done echo echo &quot;++++++++++++++++++++++&quot; printf &quot;\nAll done, last: $last\n&quot; # The output of this line #+ changes if you uncomment line 5. # (Bash, version -ge 4.2 required.) exit 0 # End of code. # (Partial) output of script follows. # The 'echo' supplies extra brackets. ############################################# ./readpipe.sh {#!/bin/sh} {last=&quot;(null)&quot;} {cat $0 |} {while read line} {do} {echo &quot;{$line}&quot;} {last=$line} {done} {printf &quot;nAll done, last: $lastn&quot;} All done, last: (null) The variable (last) is set within the loop/subshell but its value does not persist outside the loop. The gendiff script, usually found in /usr/bin on many Linux distros, pipes the output of find to a while read construct. find $1 \( -name &quot;*$2&quot; -o -name &quot;.*$2&quot; \) -print | while read f; do . . . Tip It is possible to paste text into the input field of a read (but not multiple lines!). See Example A-38. Filesystem cd The familiar cd change directory command finds use in scripts where execution of a command requires being in a specified directory. (cd /source/directory &amp;&amp; tar cf - . ) | (cd /dest/directory &amp;&amp; tar xpvf -) [from the previously cited example by Alan Cox] The -P (physical) option to cd causes it to ignore symbolic links. cd - changes to $OLDPWD, the previous working directory. Caution The cd command does not function as expected when presented with two forward slashes. bash$ cd // bash$ pwd // The output should, of course, be /. This is a problem both from the command-line and in a script. pwd Print Working Directory. This gives the user's (or script's) current directory (see Example 15-9). The effect is identical to reading the value of the builtin variable $PWD. pushd, popd, dirs This command set is a mechanism for bookmarking working directories, a means of moving back and forth through directories in an orderly manner. A pushdown stack is used to keep track of directory names. Options allow various manipulations of the directory stack. pushd dir-name pushes the path dir-name onto the directory stack (to the top of the stack) and simultaneously changes the current working directory to dir-name popd removes (pops) the top directory path name off the directory stack and simultaneously changes the current working directory to the directory now at the top of the stack. dirs lists the contents of the directory stack (compare this with the $DIRSTACK variable). A successful pushd or popd will automatically invoke dirs. Scripts that require various changes to the current working directory without hard-coding the directory name changes can make good use of these commands. Note that the implicit $DIRSTACK array variable, accessible from within a script, holds the contents of the directory stack. Example 15-9. Changing the current working directory #!/bin/bash dir1=/usr/local dir2=/var/spool pushd $dir1 # Will do an automatic 'dirs' (list directory stack to stdout). echo &quot;Now in directory `pwd`.&quot; # Uses back-quoted 'pwd'. # Now, do some stuff in directory 'dir1'. pushd $dir2 echo &quot;Now in directory `pwd`.&quot; # Now, do some stuff in directory 'dir2'. echo &quot;The top entry in the DIRSTACK array is $DIRSTACK.&quot; popd echo &quot;Now back in directory `pwd`.&quot; # Now, do some more stuff in directory 'dir1'. popd echo &quot;Now back in original working directory `pwd`.&quot; exit 0 # What happens if you don't 'popd' -- then exit the script? # Which directory do you end up in? Why? Variables let The let command carries out arithmetic operations on variables. [60] In many cases, it functions as a less complex version of expr. Example 15-10. Letting let do arithmetic. #!/bin/bash echo let a=11 # Same as 'a=11' let a=a+5 # Equivalent to let &quot;a = a + 5&quot; # (Double quotes and spaces make it more readable.) echo &quot;11 + 5 = $a&quot; # 16 let &quot;a &lt;&lt;= 3&quot; # Equivalent to let &quot;a = a &lt;&lt; 3&quot; echo &quot;\&quot;\$a\&quot; (=16) left-shifted 3 places = $a&quot; # 128 let &quot;a /= 4&quot; # Equivalent to let &quot;a = a / 4&quot; echo &quot;128 / 4 = $a&quot; # 32 let &quot;a -= 5&quot; # Equivalent to let &quot;a = a - 5&quot; echo &quot;32 - 5 = $a&quot; # 27 let &quot;a *= 10&quot; # Equivalent to let &quot;a = a * 10&quot; echo &quot;27 * 10 = $a&quot; # 270 let &quot;a %= 8&quot; # Equivalent to let &quot;a = a % 8&quot; echo &quot;270 modulo 8 = $a (270 / 8 = 33, remainder $a)&quot; # 6 # Does &quot;let&quot; permit C-style operators? # Yes, just as the (( ... )) double-parentheses construct does. let a++ # C-style (post) increment. echo &quot;6++ = $a&quot; # 6++ = 7 let a-- # C-style decrement. echo &quot;7-- = $a&quot; # 7-- = 6 # Of course, ++a, etc., also allowed . . . echo # Trinary operator. # Note that $a is 6, see above. let &quot;t = a&lt;7?7:11&quot; # True echo $t # 7 let a++ let &quot;t = a&lt;7?7:11&quot; # False echo $t # 11 exit Caution The let command can, in certain contexts, return a surprising exit status. # Evgeniy Ivanov points out: var=0 echo $? # 0 # As expected. let var++ echo $? # 1 # The command was successful, so why isn't $?=0 ??? # Anomaly! let var++ echo $? # 0 # As expected. # Likewise . . . let var=0 echo $? # 1 # The command was successful, so why isn't $?=0 ??? # However, as Jeff Gorak points out, #+ this is part of the design spec for 'let' . . . # &quot;If the last ARG evaluates to 0, let returns 1; # let returns 0 otherwise.&quot; ['help let'] eval eval arg1 [arg2] ... [argN] Combines the arguments in an expression or list of expressions and evaluates them. Any variables within the expression are expanded. The net result is to convert a string into a command. Tip The eval command can be used for code generation from the command-line or within a script. bash$ command_string=&quot;ps ax&quot; bash$ process=&quot;ps ax&quot; bash$ eval &quot;$command_string&quot; | grep &quot;$process&quot; 26973 pts/3 R+ 0:00 grep --color ps ax 26974 pts/3 R+ 0:00 ps ax Each invocation of eval forces a re-evaluation of its arguments. a='$b' b='$c' c=d echo $a # $b # First level. eval echo $a # $c # Second level. eval eval echo $a # d # Third level. # Thank you, E.

A version of rot13 #!/bin/bash # A version of &quot;rot13&quot; using 'eval'. # Compare to &quot;rot13.sh&quot; example. setvar_rot_13() # &quot;rot13&quot; scrambling { local varname=$1 varvalue=$2 eval $varname='$(echo &quot;$varvalue&quot; | tr a-z n-za-m)' } setvar_rot_13 var &quot;foobar&quot; # Run &quot;foobar&quot; through rot13. echo $var # sbbone setvar_rot_13 var &quot;$var&quot; # Run &quot;sbbone&quot; through rot13. # Back to original variable. echo $var # foobar # This example by Stephane Chazelas. # Modified by document author. exit 0 Here is another example of using eval to evaluate a complex expression, this one from an earlier version of YongYe's Tetris game script. eval ${1}+=\&quot;${x} ${y} \&quot; Example A-53 uses eval to convert array elements into a command list. The eval command occurs in the older version of indirect referencing. eval var=\$$var Tip The eval command can be used to parameterize brace expansion. Caution The eval command can be risky, and normally should be avoided when there exists a reasonable alternative. An eval $COMMANDS executes the contents of COMMANDS, which may contain such unpleasant surprises as rm -rf *. Running an eval on unfamiliar code written by persons unknown is living dangerously. set The set command changes the value of internal script variables/options. One use for this is to toggle option flags which help determine the behavior of the script. Another application for it is to reset the positional parameters that a script sees as the result of a command (set `command`). The script can then parse the fields of the command output. Example 15-16. Using set with positional parameters #!/bin/bash # ex34.sh # Script &quot;set-test&quot; # Invoke this script with three command-line parameters, # for example, &quot;sh ex34.sh one two three&quot;. echo echo &quot;Positional parameters before set \`uname -a\` :&quot; echo &quot;Command-line argument #1 = $1&quot; echo &quot;Command-line argument #2 = $2&quot; echo &quot;Command-line argument #3 = $3&quot; set `uname -a` # Sets the positional parameters to the output # of the command `uname -a` echo echo +++++ echo $_ # +++++ # Flags set in script. echo $- # hB # Anomalous behavior? echo echo &quot;Positional parameters after set \`uname -a\` :&quot; # $1, $2, $3, etc. reinitialized to result of `uname -a` echo &quot;Field #1 of 'uname -a' = $1&quot; echo &quot;Field #2 of 'uname -a' = $2&quot; echo &quot;Field #3 of 'uname -a' = $3&quot; echo \#\#\# echo $_ # ### echo exit 0 More fun with positional parameters. Example 15-17. Reversing the positional parameters #!/bin/bash # revposparams.sh: Reverse positional parameters. # Script by Dan Jacobson, with stylistic revisions by document author. set a\ b c d\ e; # ^ ^ Spaces escaped # ^ ^ Spaces not escaped OIFS=$IFS; IFS=:; # ^ Saving old IFS and setting new one. echo until [ $# -eq 0 ] do # Step through positional parameters. echo &quot;### k0 = &quot;$k&quot;&quot; # Before k=$1:$k; # Append each pos param to loop variable. # ^ echo &quot;### k = &quot;$k&quot;&quot; # After echo shift; done set $k # Set new positional parameters. echo - echo $# # Count of positional parameters. echo - echo for i # Omitting the &quot;in list&quot; sets the variable -- i -- #+ to the positional parameters. do echo $i # Display new positional parameters. done IFS=$OIFS # Restore IFS. # Question: # Is it necessary to set an new IFS, internal field separator, #+ in order for this script to work properly? # What happens if you don't? Try it. # And, why use the new IFS -- a colon -- in line 17, #+ to append to the loop variable? # What is the purpose of this? exit 0 $ ./revposparams.sh ### k0 = ### k = a b ### k0 = a b ### k = c a b ### k0 = c a b ### k = d e c a b - 3 - d e c a b Invoking set without any options or arguments simply lists all the environmental and other variables that have been initialized. bash$ set AUTHORCOPY=/home/bozo/posts BASH=/bin/bash BASH_VERSION=$'2.05.8(1)-release' ... XAUTHORITY=/home/bozo/.Xauthority _=/etc/bashrc variable22=abc variable23=xzy Using set with the -- option explicitly assigns the contents of a variable to the positional parameters. If no variable follows the -- it unsets the positional parameters. Example 15-18. Reassigning the positional parameters #!/bin/bash variable=&quot;one two three four five&quot; set -- $variable # Sets positional parameters to the contents of &quot;$variable&quot;. first_param=$1 second_param=$2 shift; shift # Shift past first two positional params. # shift 2 also works. remaining_params=&quot;$*&quot; echo echo &quot;first parameter = $first_param&quot; # one echo &quot;second parameter = $second_param&quot; # two echo &quot;remaining parameters = $remaining_params&quot; # three four five echo; echo # Again. set -- $variable first_param=$1 second_param=$2 echo &quot;first parameter = $first_param&quot; # one echo &quot;second parameter = $second_param&quot; # two # ====================================================== set -- # Unsets positional parameters if no variable specified. first_param=$1 second_param=$2 echo &quot;first parameter = $first_param&quot; # (null value) echo &quot;second parameter = $second_param&quot; # (null value) exit 0 See also Example 11-2 and Example 16-56. unset The unset command deletes a shell variable, effectively setting it to null. Note that this command does not affect positional parameters. bash$ unset PATH bash$ echo $PATH bash$ Example 15-19. &quot;Unsetting&quot; a variable #!/bin/bash # unset.sh: Unsetting a variable. variable=hello # Initialized. echo &quot;variable = $variable&quot; unset variable # Unset. # In this particular context, #+ same effect as: variable= echo &quot;(unset) variable = $variable&quot; # $variable is null. if [ -z &quot;$variable&quot; ] # Try a string-length test. then echo &quot;\$variable has zero length.&quot; fi exit 0 Note In most contexts, an undeclared variable and one that has been unset are equivalent. However, the ${parameter:-default} parameter substitution construct can distinguish between the two. export The export [61] command makes available variables to all child processes of the running script or shell. One important use of the export command is in startup files, to initialize and make accessible environmental variables to subsequent user processes. Caution Unfortunately, there is no way to export variables back to the parent process, to the process that called or invoked the script or shell. Example 15-20. Using export to pass a variable to an embedded awk script #!/bin/bash # Yet another version of the &quot;column totaler&quot; script (col-totaler.sh) #+ that adds up a specified column (of numbers) in the target file. # This uses the environment to pass a script variable to 'awk' . . . #+ and places the awk script in a variable. ARGS=2 E_WRONGARGS=85 if [ $# -ne &quot;$ARGS&quot; ] # Check for proper number of command-line args. then echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` filename column-number&quot; exit $E_WRONGARGS fi filename=$1 column_number=$2 #===== Same as original script, up to this point =====# export column_number # Export column number to environment, so it's available for retrieval. # ----------------------------------------------- awkscript='{ total += $ENVIRON[&quot;column_number&quot;] } END { print total }' # Yes, a variable can hold an awk script. # ----------------------------------------------- # Now, run the awk script. awk &quot;$awkscript&quot; &quot;$filename&quot; # Thanks, Stephane Chazelas. exit 0 Tip It is possible to initialize and export variables in the same operation, as in export var1=xxx. However, as Greg Keraunen points out, in certain situations this may have a different effect than setting a variable, then exporting it. bash$ export var=(a b); echo ${var[0]} (a b) bash$ var=(a b); export var; echo ${var[0]} a Note A variable to be exported may require special treatment. See Example M-2. declare, typeset The declare and typeset commands specify and/or restrict properties of variables. readonly Same as declare -r, sets a variable as read-only, or, in effect, as a constant. Attempts to change the variable fail with an error message. This is the shell analog of the C language const type qualifier. getopts This powerful tool parses command-line arguments passed to the script. This is the Bash analog of the getopt external command and the getopt library function familiar to C programmers. It permits passing and concatenating multiple options [62] and associated arguments to a script (for example scriptname -abc -e /usr/local). The getopts construct uses two implicit variables. $OPTIND is the argument pointer (OPTion INDex) and $OPTARG (OPTion ARGument) the (optional) argument attached to an option. A colon following the option name in the declaration tags that option as having an associated argument. A getopts construct usually comes packaged in a while loop, which processes the options and arguments one at a time, then increments the implicit $OPTIND variable to point to the next. Note The arguments passed from the command-line to the script must be preceded by a dash (-). It is the prefixed - that lets getopts recognize command-line arguments as options. In fact, getopts will not process arguments without the prefixed -, and will terminate option processing at the first argument encountered lacking them. The getopts template differs slightly from the standard while loop, in that it lacks condition brackets. The getopts construct is a highly functional replacement for the traditional getopt external command. while getopts &quot;:abcde:fg&quot; Option # Initial declaration. # a, b, c, d, e, f, and g are the options (flags) expected. # The : after option 'e' shows it will have an argument passed with it. do case $Option in a ) # Do something with variable 'a'. b ) # Do something with variable 'b'. ... e) # Do something with 'e', and also with $OPTARG, # which is the associated argument passed with option 'e'. ... g ) # Do something with variable 'g'. esac done shift $(($OPTIND - 1)) # Move argument pointer to next. # All this is not nearly as complicated as it looks &lt;grin&gt;. Example 15-21. Using getopts to read the options/arguments passed to a script #!/bin/bash # ex33.sh: Exercising getopts and OPTIND # Script modified 10/09/03 at the suggestion of Bill Gradwohl. # Here we observe how 'getopts' processes command-line arguments to script. # The arguments are parsed as &quot;options&quot; (flags) and associated arguments. # Try invoking this script with: # 'scriptname -mn' # 'scriptname -oq qOption' (qOption can be some arbitrary string.) # 'scriptname -qXXX -r' # # 'scriptname -qr' #+ - Unexpected result, takes &quot;r&quot; as the argument to option &quot;q&quot; # 'scriptname -q -r' #+ - Unexpected result, same as above # 'scriptname -mnop -mnop' - Unexpected result # (OPTIND is unreliable at stating where an option came from.) # # If an option expects an argument (&quot;flag:&quot;), then it will grab #+ whatever is next on the command-line. NO_ARGS=0 E_OPTERROR=85 if [ $# -eq &quot;$NO_ARGS&quot; ] # Script invoked with no command-line args? then echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` options (-mnopqrs)&quot; exit $E_OPTERROR # Exit and explain usage. # Usage: scriptname -options # Note: dash (-) necessary fi while getopts &quot;:mnopq:rs&quot; Option do case $Option in m ) echo &quot;Scenario #1: option -m- [OPTIND=${OPTIND}]&quot;;; n | o ) echo &quot;Scenario #2: option -$Option- [OPTIND=${OPTIND}]&quot;;; p ) echo &quot;Scenario #3: option -p- [OPTIND=${OPTIND}]&quot;;; q ) echo &quot;Scenario #4: option -q-\ with argument \&quot;$OPTARG\&quot; [OPTIND=${OPTIND}]&quot;;; # Note that option 'q' must have an associated argument, #+ otherwise it falls through to the default. r | s ) echo &quot;Scenario #5: option -$Option-&quot;;; * ) echo &quot;Unimplemented option chosen.&quot;;; # Default. esac done shift $(($OPTIND - 1)) # Decrements the argument pointer so it points to next argument. # $1 now references the first non-option item supplied on the command-line #+ if one exists. exit $? # As Bill Gradwohl states, # &quot;The getopts mechanism allows one to specify: scriptname -mnop -mnop #+ but there is no reliable way to differentiate what came #+ from where by using OPTIND.&quot; # There are, however, workarounds. Script Behavior source, . (dot command) This command, when invoked from the command-line, executes a script. Within a script, a source file-name loads the file file-name. Sourcing a file (dot-command) imports code into the script, appending to the script (same effect as the #include directive in a C program). The net result is the same as if the &quot;sourced&quot; lines of code were physically present in the body of the script. This is useful in situations when multiple scripts use a common data file or function library. Example 15-22. &quot;Including&quot; a data file #!/bin/bash # Note that this example must be invoked with bash, i.e., bash ex38.sh #+ not sh ex38.sh ! . data-file # Load a data file. # Same effect as &quot;source data-file&quot;, but more portable. # The file &quot;data-file&quot; must be present in current working directory, #+ since it is referred to by its basename. # Now, let's reference some data from that file. echo &quot;variable1 (from data-file) = $variable1&quot; echo &quot;variable3 (from data-file) = $variable3&quot; let &quot;sum = $variable2 + $variable4&quot; echo &quot;Sum of variable2 + variable4 (from data-file) = $sum&quot; echo &quot;message1 (from data-file) is \&quot;$message1\&quot;&quot; # Escaped quotes echo &quot;message2 (from data-file) is \&quot;$message2\&quot;&quot; print_message This is the message-print function in the data-file. exit $? File data-file for Example 15-22, above. Must be present in same directory. # This is a data file loaded by a script. # Files of this type may contain variables, functions, etc. # It loads with a 'source' or '.' command from a shell script. # Let's initialize some variables. variable1=23 variable2=474 variable3=5 variable4=97 message1=&quot;Greetings from *** line $LINENO *** of the data file!&quot; message2=&quot;Enough for now. Goodbye.&quot; print_message () { # Echoes any message passed to it. if [ -z &quot;$1&quot; ] then return 1 # Error, if argument missing. fi echo until [ -z &quot;$1&quot; ] do # Step through arguments passed to function. echo -n &quot;$1&quot; # Echo args one at a time, suppressing line feeds. echo -n &quot; &quot; # Insert spaces between words. shift # Next one. done echo return 0 } If the sourced file is itself an executable script, then it will run, then return control to the script that called it. A sourced executable script may use a return for this purpose. Arguments may be (optionally) passed to the sourced file as positional parameters. source $filename $arg1 arg2 It is even possible for a script to source itself, though this does not seem to have any practical applications. Example 15-23. A (useless) script that sources itself #!/bin/bash # self-source.sh: a script sourcing itself &quot;recursively.&quot; # From &quot;Stupid Script Tricks,&quot; Volume II. MAXPASSCNT=100 # Maximum number of execution passes. echo -n &quot;$pass_count &quot; # At first execution pass, this just echoes two blank spaces, #+ since $pass_count still uninitialized. let &quot;pass_count += 1&quot; # Assumes the uninitialized variable $pass_count #+ can be incremented the first time around. # This works with Bash and pdksh, but #+ it relies on non-portable (and possibly dangerous) behavior. # Better would be to initialize $pass_count to 0 before incrementing. while [ &quot;$pass_count&quot; -le $MAXPASSCNT ] do . $0 # Script &quot;sources&quot; itself, rather than calling itself. # ./$0 (which would be true recursion) doesn't work here. Why? done # What occurs here is not actually recursion, #+ since the script effectively &quot;expands&quot; itself, i.e., #+ generates a new section of code #+ with each pass through the 'while' loop', # with each 'source' in line 20. # # Of course, the script interprets each newly 'sourced' &quot;#!&quot; line #+ as a comment, and not as the start of a new script. echo exit 0 # The net effect is counting from 1 to 100. # Very impressive. # Exercise: # -------- # Write a script that uses this trick to actually do something useful. exit Unconditionally terminates a script. [63] The exit command may optionally take an integer argument, which is returned to the shell as the exit status of the script. It is good practice to end all but the simplest scripts with an exit 0, indicating a successful run. Note If a script terminates with an exit lacking an argument, the exit status of the script is the exit status of the last command executed in the script, not counting the exit. This is equivalent to an exit $?. Note An exit command may also be used to terminate a subshell. exec This shell builtin replaces the current process with a specified command. Normally, when the shell encounters a command, it forks off a child process to actually execute the command. Using the exec builtin, the shell does not fork, and the command exec'ed replaces the shell. When used in a script, therefore, it forces an exit from the script when the exec'ed command terminates. [64] Example 15-24. Effects of exec #!/bin/bash exec echo &quot;Exiting \&quot;$0\&quot; at line $LINENO.&quot; # Exit from script here. # $LINENO is an internal Bash variable set to the line number it's on. # ---------------------------------- # The following lines never execute. echo &quot;This echo fails to echo.&quot; exit 99 # This script will not exit here. # Check exit value after script terminates #+ with an 'echo $?'. # It will *not* be 99. Example 15-25. A script that exec's itself #!/bin/bash # self-exec.sh # Note: Set permissions on this script to 555 or 755, # then call it with ./self-exec.sh or sh ./self-exec.sh. echo echo &quot;This line appears ONCE in the script, yet it keeps echoing.&quot; echo &quot;The PID of this instance of the script is still $$.&quot; # Demonstrates that a subshell is not forked off. echo &quot;==================== Hit Ctl-C to exit ====================&quot; sleep 1 exec $0 # Spawns another instance of this same script #+ that replaces the previous one. echo &quot;This line will never echo!&quot; # Why not? exit 99 # Will not exit here! # Exit code will not be 99! An exec also serves to reassign file descriptors. For example, exec &lt;zzz-file replaces stdin with the file zzz-file. Note The -exec option to find is not the same as the exec shell builtin. shopt This command permits changing shell options on the fly (see Example 25-1 and Example 25-2). It often appears in the Bash startup files, but also has its uses in scripts. Needs version 2 or later of Bash. shopt -s cdspell # Allows minor misspelling of directory names with 'cd' # Option -s sets, -u unsets. cd /hpme # Oops! Mistyped '/home'. pwd # /home # The shell corrected the misspelling. caller Putting a caller command inside a function echoes to stdout information about the caller of that function. #!/bin/bash function1 () { # Inside function1 (). caller 0 # Tell me about it. } function1 # Line 9 of script. # 9 main test.sh # ^ Line number that the function was called from. # ^^^^ Invoked from &quot;main&quot; part of script. # ^^^^^^^ Name of calling script. caller 0 # Has no effect because it's not inside a function. A caller command can also return caller information from a script sourced within another script. Analogous to a function, this is a &quot;subroutine call.&quot; You may find this command useful in debugging. Commands true A command that returns a successful (zero) exit status, but does nothing else. bash$ true bash$ echo $? 0 # Endless loop while true # alias for &quot;:&quot; do operation-1 operation-2 ... operation-n # Need a way to break out of loop or script will hang. done false A command that returns an unsuccessful exit status, but does nothing else. bash$ false bash$ echo $? 1 # Testing &quot;false&quot; if false then echo &quot;false evaluates \&quot;true\&quot;&quot; else echo &quot;false evaluates \&quot;false\&quot;&quot; fi # false evaluates &quot;false&quot; # Looping while &quot;false&quot; (null loop) while false do # The following code will not execute. operation-1 operation-2 ... operation-n # Nothing happens! done type [cmd] Similar to the which external command, type cmd identifies &quot;cmd.&quot; Unlike which, type is a Bash builtin. The useful -a option to type identifies keywords and builtins, and also locates system commands with identical names. bash$ type '[' [ is a shell builtin bash$ type -a '[' [ is a shell builtin [ is /usr/bin/[ bash$ type type type is a shell builtin The type command can be useful for testing whether a certain command exists. hash [cmds] Records the path name of specified commands -- in the shell hash table [65] -- so the shell or script will not need to search the $PATH on subsequent calls to those commands. When hash is called with no arguments, it simply lists the commands that have been hashed. The -r option resets the hash table. bind The bind builtin displays or modifies readline [66] key bindings. help Gets a short usage summary of a shell builtin. This is the counterpart to whatis, but for builtins. The display of help information got a much-needed update in the version 4 release of Bash. bash$ help exit exit: exit [n] Exit the shell with a status of N. If N is omitted, the exit status is that of the last command executed. 15.1. Job Control Commands Certain of the following job control commands take a job identifier as an argument. See the table at end of the chapter. jobs Lists the jobs running in the background, giving the job number. Not as useful as ps. Note It is all too easy to confuse jobs and processes. Certain builtins, such as kill, disown, and wait accept either a job number or a process number as an argument. The fg, bg and jobs commands accept only a job number. bash$ sleep 100 &amp; [1] 1384 bash $ jobs [1]+ Running sleep 100 &amp; &quot;1&quot; is the job number (jobs are maintained by the current shell). &quot;1384&quot; is the PID or process ID number (processes are maintained by the system). To kill this job/process, either a kill %1 or a kill 1384 works. Thanks, S.C. disown Remove job(s) from the shell's table of active jobs. fg, bg The fg command switches a job running in the background into the foreground. The bg command restarts a suspended job, and runs it in the background. If no job number is specified, then the fg or bg command acts upon the currently running job. wait Suspend script execution until all jobs running in background have terminated, or until the job number or process ID specified as an option terminates. Returns the exit status of waited-for command. You may use the wait command to prevent a script from exiting before a background job finishes executing (this would create a dreaded orphan process). Example 15-26. Waiting for a process to finish before proceeding #!/bin/bash ROOT_UID=0 # Only users with $UID 0 have root privileges. E_NOTROOT=65 E_NOPARAMS=66 if [ &quot;$UID&quot; -ne &quot;$ROOT_UID&quot; ] then echo &quot;Must be root to run this script.&quot; # &quot;Run along kid, it's past your bedtime.&quot; exit $E_NOTROOT fi if [ -z &quot;$1&quot; ] then echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` find-string&quot; exit $E_NOPARAMS fi echo &quot;Updating 'locate' database...&quot; echo &quot;This may take a while.&quot; updatedb /usr &amp; # Must be run as root. wait # Don't run the rest of the script until 'updatedb' finished. # You want the the database updated before looking up the file name. locate $1 # Without the 'wait' command, in the worse case scenario, #+ the script would exit while 'updatedb' was still running, #+ leaving it as an orphan process. exit 0 Optionally, wait can take a job identifier as an argument, for example, wait%1 or wait $PPID. [67] See the job id table. Tip Within a script, running a command in the background with an ampersand (&amp;) may cause the script to hang until ENTER is hit. This seems to occur with commands that write to stdout. It can be a major annoyance. #!/bin/bash # test.sh ls -l &amp; echo &quot;Done.&quot; bash$ ./test.sh Done. [bozo@localhost test-scripts]$ total 1 -rwxr-xr-x 1 bozo bozo 34 Oct 11 15:09 test.sh _ As Walter Brameld IV explains it: As far as I can tell, such scripts don't actually hang. It just seems that they do because the background command writes text to the console after the prompt. The user gets the impression that the prompt was never displayed. Here's the sequence of events: 1. Script launches background command. 2. Script exits. 3. Shell displays the prompt. 4. Background command continues running and writing text to the console. 5. Background command finishes. 6. User doesn't see a prompt at the bottom of the output, thinks script is hanging. Placing a wait after the background command seems to remedy this. #!/bin/bash # test.sh ls -l &amp; echo &quot;Done.&quot; wait bash$ ./test.sh Done. [bozo@localhost test-scripts]$ total 1 -rwxr-xr-x 1 bozo bozo 34 Oct 11 15:09 test.sh Redirecting the output of the command to a file or even to /dev/null also takes care of this problem. suspend This has a similar effect to Control-Z, but it suspends the shell (the shell's parent process should resume it at an appropriate time). logout Exit a login shell, optionally specifying an exit status. times Gives statistics on the system time elapsed when executing commands, in the following form: 0m0.020s 0m0.020s This capability is of relatively limited value, since it is not common to profile and benchmark shell scripts. kill Forcibly terminate a process by sending it an appropriate terminate signal (see Example 17-6). Example 15-27. A script that kills itself #!/bin/bash # self-destruct.sh kill $$ # Script kills its own process here. # Recall that &quot;$$&quot; is the script's PID. echo &quot;This line will not echo.&quot; # Instead, the shell sends a &quot;Terminated&quot; message to stdout. exit 0 # Normal exit? No! # After this script terminates prematurely, #+ what exit status does it return? # # sh self-destruct.sh # echo $? # 143 # # 143 = 128 + 15 # TERM signal Note kill -l lists all the signals (as does the file /usr/include/asm/signal.h). A kill -9 is a sure kill, which will usually terminate a process that stubbornly refuses to die with a plain kill. Sometimes, a kill -15 works. A zombie process, that is, a child process that has terminated, but that the parent process has not (yet) killed, cannot be killed by a logged-on user -- you can't kill something that is already dead -- but init will generally clean it up sooner or later. killall The killall command kills a running process by name, rather than by process ID. If there are multiple instances of a particular command running, then doing a killall on that command will terminate them all. Note This refers to the killall command in /usr/bin, not the killall script in /etc/rc.d/init.d. command The command directive disables aliases and functions for the command immediately following it. bash$ command ls Note This is one of three shell directives that effect script command processing. The others are builtin and enable. builtin Invoking builtin BUILTIN_COMMAND runs the command BUILTIN_COMMAND as a shell builtin, temporarily disabling both functions and external system commands with the same name. enable This either enables or disables a shell builtin command. As an example, enable -n kill disables the shell builtin kill, so that when Bash subsequently encounters kill, it invokes the external command /bin/kill. The -a option to enable lists all the shell builtins, indicating whether or not they are enabled. The -f filename option lets enable load a builtin as a shared library (DLL) module from a properly compiled object file. [68]. autoload This is a port to Bash of the ksh autoloader. With autoload in place, a function with an autoload declaration will load from an external file at its first invocation. [69] This saves system resources. Note that autoload is not a part of the core Bash installation. It needs to be loaded in with enable -f (see above). Table 15-1. Job identifiers Notation Meaning %N Job number [N] %S Invocation (command-line) of job begins with string S %?S Invocation (command-line) of job contains within it string S %% &quot;current&quot; job (last job stopped in foreground or started in background) %+ &quot;current&quot; job (last job stopped in foreground or started in background) %- Last job $! Last background process Chapter 16. External Filters, Programs and Commands Standard UNIX commands make shell scripts more versatile. The power of scripts comes from coupling system commands and shell directives with simple programming constructs. 16.1. Basic Commands The first commands a novice learns ls The basic file &quot;list&quot; command. It is all too easy to underestimate the power of this humble command. For example, using the -R, recursive option, ls provides a tree-like listing of a directory structure. Other useful options are -S, sort listing by file size, -t, sort by file modification time, -v, sort by (numerical) version numbers embedded in the filenames, [70] -b, show escape characters, and -i, show file inodes (see Example 16-4). bash$ ls -l -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Sep 14 18:44 chapter10.txt -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Sep 14 18:44 chapter11.txt -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Sep 14 18:44 chapter12.txt -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Sep 14 18:44 chapter1.txt -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Sep 14 18:44 chapter2.txt -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Sep 14 18:44 chapter3.txt -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Sep 14 18:49 Chapter_headings.txt -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Sep 14 18:49 Preface.txt bash$ ls -lv total 0 -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Sep 14 18:49 Chapter_headings.txt -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Sep 14 18:49 Preface.txt -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Sep 14 18:44 chapter1.txt -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Sep 14 18:44 chapter2.txt -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Sep 14 18:44 chapter3.txt -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Sep 14 18:44 chapter10.txt -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Sep 14 18:44 chapter11.txt -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Sep 14 18:44 chapter12.txt Tip The ls command returns a non-zero exit status when attempting to list a non-existent file. bash$ ls abc ls: abc: No such file or directory bash$ echo $? 2 Example 16-1. Using ls to create a table of contents for burning a CDR disk #!/bin/bash # ex40.sh (burn-cd.sh) # Script to automate burning a CDR. SPEED=10 # May use higher speed if your hardware supports it. IMAGEFILE=cdimage.iso CONTENTSFILE=contents # DEVICE=/dev/cdrom For older versions of cdrecord DEVICE=&quot;1,0,0&quot; DEFAULTDIR=/opt # This is the directory containing the data to be burned. # Make sure it exists. # Exercise: Add a test for this. # Uses Joerg Schilling's &quot;cdrecord&quot; package: # http://www.fokus.fhg.de/usr/schilling/cdrecord.html # If this script invoked as an ordinary user, may need to suid cdrecord #+ chmod u+s /usr/bin/cdrecord, as root. # Of course, this creates a security hole, though a relatively minor one. if [ -z &quot;$1&quot; ] then IMAGE_DIRECTORY=$DEFAULTDIR # Default directory, if not specified on command-line. else IMAGE_DIRECTORY=$1 fi # Create a &quot;table of contents&quot; file. ls -lRF $IMAGE_DIRECTORY &gt; $IMAGE_DIRECTORY/$CONTENTSFILE # The &quot;l&quot; option gives a &quot;long&quot; file listing. # The &quot;R&quot; option makes the listing recursive. # The &quot;F&quot; option marks the file types (directories get a trailing /). echo &quot;Creating table of contents.&quot; # Create an image file preparatory to burning it onto the CDR. mkisofs -r -o $IMAGEFILE $IMAGE_DIRECTORY echo &quot;Creating ISO9660 file system image ($IMAGEFILE).&quot; # Burn the CDR. echo &quot;Burning the disk.&quot; echo &quot;Please be patient, this will take a while.&quot; wodim -v -isosize dev=$DEVICE $IMAGEFILE # In newer Linux distros, the &quot;wodim&quot; utility assumes the #+ functionality of &quot;cdrecord.&quot; exitcode=$? echo &quot;Exit code = $exitcode&quot; exit $exitcode cat, tac cat, an acronym for concatenate, lists a file to stdout. When combined with redirection (&gt; or &gt;&gt;), it is commonly used to concatenate files. # Uses of 'cat' cat filename # Lists the file. cat file.1 file.2 file.3 &gt; file.123 # Combines three files into one. The -n option to cat inserts consecutive numbers before all lines of the target file(s). The -b option numbers only the non-blank lines. The -v option echoes nonprintable characters, using ^ notation. The -s option squeezes multiple consecutive blank lines into a single blank line. See also Example 16-28 and Example 16-24. Note In a pipe, it may be more efficient to redirect the stdin to a file, rather than to cat the file. cat filename | tr a-z A-Z tr a-z A-Z &lt; filename # Same effect, but starts one less process, #+ and also dispenses with the pipe. tac, is the inverse of cat, listing a file backwards from its end. rev reverses each line of a file, and outputs to stdout. This does not have the same effect as tac, as it preserves the order of the lines, but flips each one around (mirror image). bash$ cat file1.txt This is line 1. This is line 2. bash$ tac file1.txt This is line 2. This is line 1. bash$ rev file1.txt .1 enil si sihT .2 enil si sihT cp This is the file copy command. cp file1 file2 copies file1 to file2, overwriting file2 if it already exists (see Example 16-6). Tip Particularly useful are the -a archive flag (for copying an entire directory tree), the -u update flag (which prevents overwriting identically-named newer files), and the -r and -R recursive flags. cp -u source_dir/* dest_dir # &quot;Synchronize&quot; dest_dir to source_dir #+ by copying over all newer and not previously existing files. mv This is the file move command. It is equivalent to a combination of cp and rm. It may be used to move multiple files to a directory, or even to rename a directory. For some examples of using mv in a script, see Example 10-11 and Example A-2. Note When used in a non-interactive script, mv takes the -f (force) option to bypass user input. When a directory is moved to a preexisting directory, it becomes a subdirectory of the destination directory. bash$ mv source_directory target_directory bash$ ls -lF target_directory total 1 drwxrwxr-x 2 bozo bozo 1024 May 28 19:20 source_directory/ rm Delete (remove) a file or files. The -f option forces removal of even readonly files, and is useful for bypassing user input in a script. Note The rm command will, by itself, fail to remove filenames beginning with a dash. Why? Because rm sees a dash-prefixed filename as an option. bash$ rm -badname rm: invalid option -- b Try `rm --help' for more information. One clever workaround is to precede the filename with a &quot; -- &quot; (the end-of-options flag). bash$ rm -- -badname Another method to is to preface the filename to be removed with a dot-slash . bash$ rm ./-badname Warning When used with the recursive flag -r, this command removes files all the way down the directory tree from the current directory. A careless rm -rf * can wipe out a big chunk of a directory structure. rmdir Remove directory. The directory must be empty of all files -- including &quot;invisible&quot; dotfiles [71] -- for this command to succeed. mkdir Make directory, creates a new directory. For example, mkdir -p project/programs/December creates the named directory. The -p option automatically creates any necessary parent directories. chmod Changes the attributes of an existing file or directory (see Example 15-14). chmod +x filename # Makes &quot;filename&quot; executable for all users. chmod u+s filename # Sets &quot;suid&quot; bit on &quot;filename&quot; permissions. # An ordinary user may execute &quot;filename&quot; with same privileges as the file's owner. # (This does not apply to shell scripts.) chmod 644 filename # Makes &quot;filename&quot; readable/writable to owner, readable to others #+ (octal mode). chmod 444 filename # Makes &quot;filename&quot; read-only for all. # Modifying the file (for example, with a text editor) #+ not allowed for a user who does not own the file (except for root), #+ and even the file owner must force a file-save #+ if she modifies the file. # Same restrictions apply for deleting the file. chmod 1777 directory-name # Gives everyone read, write, and execute permission in directory, #+ however also sets the &quot;sticky bit&quot;. # This means that only the owner of the directory, #+ owner of the file, and, of course, root #+ can delete any particular file in that directory. chmod 111 directory-name # Gives everyone execute-only permission in a directory. # This means that you can execute and READ the files in that directory #+ (execute permission necessarily includes read permission #+ because you can't execute a file without being able to read it). # But you can't list the files or search for them with the &quot;find&quot; command. # These restrictions do not apply to root. chmod 000 directory-name # No permissions at all for that directory. # Can't read, write, or execute files in it. # Can't even list files in it or &quot;cd&quot; to it. # But, you can rename (mv) the directory #+ or delete it (rmdir) if it is empty. # You can even symlink to files in the directory, #+ but you can't read, write, or execute the symlinks. # These restrictions do not apply to root. chattr Change file attributes. This is analogous to chmod above, but with different options and a different invocation syntax, and it works only on ext2/ext3 filesystems. One particularly interesting chattr option is i. A chattr +i filename marks the file as immutable. The file cannot be modified, linked to, or deleted, not even by root. This file attribute can be set or removed only by root. In a similar fashion, the a option marks the file as append only. root# chattr +i file1.txt root# rm file1.txt rm: remove write-protected regular file `file1.txt'? y rm: cannot remove `file1.txt': Operation not permitted If a file has the s (secure) attribute set, then when it is deleted its block is overwritten with binary zeroes. [72] If a file has the u (undelete) attribute set, then when it is deleted, its contents can still be retrieved (undeleted). If a file has the c (compress) attribute set, then it will automatically be compressed on writes to disk, and uncompressed on reads. Note The file attributes set with chattr do not show in a file listing (ls -l). ln Creates links to pre-existings files. A &quot;link&quot; is a reference to a file, an alternate name for it. The ln command permits referencing the linked file by more than one name and is a superior alternative to aliasing (see Example 4-6). The ln creates only a reference, a pointer to the file only a few bytes in size. The ln command is most often used with the -s, symbolic or &quot;soft&quot; link flag. Advantages of using the -s flag are that it permits linking across file systems or to directories. The syntax of the command is a bit tricky. For example: ln -s oldfile newfile links the previously existing oldfile to the newly created link, newfile. Caution If a file named newfile has previously existed, an error message will result. Which type of link to use? As John Macdonald explains it: Both of these [types of links] provide a certain measure of dual reference -- if you edit the contents of the file using any name, your changes will affect both the original name and either a hard or soft new name. The differences between them occurs when you work at a higher level. The advantage of a hard link is that the new name is totally independent of the old name -- if you remove or rename the old name, that does not affect the hard link, which continues to point to the data while it would leave a soft link hanging pointing to the old name which is no longer there. The advantage of a soft link is that it can refer to a different file system (since it is just a reference to a file name, not to actual data). And, unlike a hard link, a symbolic link can refer to a directory. Links give the ability to invoke a script (or any other type of executable) with multiple names, and having that script behave according to how it was invoked. Example 16-2. Hello or Good-bye #!/bin/bash # hello.sh: Saying &quot;hello&quot; or &quot;goodbye&quot; #+ depending on how script is invoked. # Make a link in current working directory ($PWD) to this script: # ln -s hello.sh goodbye # Now, try invoking this script both ways: # ./hello.sh # ./goodbye HELLO_CALL=65 GOODBYE_CALL=66 if [ $0 = &quot;./goodbye&quot; ] then echo &quot;Good-bye!&quot; # Some other goodbye-type commands, as appropriate. exit $GOODBYE_CALL fi echo &quot;Hello!&quot; # Some other hello-type commands, as appropriate. exit $HELLO_CALL man, info These commands access the manual and information pages on system commands and installed utilities. When available, the info pages usually contain more detailed descriptions than do the man pages. There have been various attempts at &quot;automating&quot; the writing of man pages. For a script that makes a tentative first step in that direction, see Example A-39. 16.2. Complex Commands Commands for more advanced users find -exec COMMAND \; Carries out COMMAND on each file that find matches. The command sequence terminates with ; (the &quot;;&quot; is escaped to make certain the shell passes it to find literally, without interpreting it as a special character). bash$ find ~/ -name '*.txt' /home/bozo/.kde/share/apps/karm/karmdata.txt /home/bozo/misc/irmeyc.txt /home/bozo/test-scripts/1.txt If COMMAND contains {}, then find substitutes the full path name of the selected file for &quot;{}&quot;. find ~/ -name 'core*' -exec rm {} \; # Removes all core dump files from user's home directory. find /home/bozo/projects -mtime -1 # ^ Note minus sign! # Lists all files in /home/bozo/projects directory tree #+ that were modified within the last day (current_day - 1). # find /home/bozo/projects -mtime 1 # Same as above, but modified *exactly* one day ago. # # mtime = last modification time of the target file # ctime = last status change time (via 'chmod' or otherwise) # atime = last access time DIR=/home/bozo/junk_files find &quot;$DIR&quot; -type f -atime +5 -exec rm {} \; # ^ ^^ # Curly brackets are placeholder for the path name output by &quot;find.&quot; # # Deletes all files in &quot;/home/bozo/junk_files&quot; #+ that have not been accessed in *at least* 5 days (plus sign ... +5). # # &quot;-type filetype&quot;, where # f = regular file # d = directory # l = symbolic link, etc. # # (The 'find' manpage and info page have complete option listings.) find /etc -exec grep '[0-9][0-9]*[.][0-9][0-9]*[.][0-9][0-9]*[.][0-9][0-9]*' {} \; # Finds all IP addresses (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) in /etc directory files. # There a few extraneous hits. Can they be filtered out? # Possibly by: find /etc -type f -exec cat '{}' \; | tr -c '.[:digit:]' '\n' \ | grep '^[^.][^.]*\.[^.][^.]*\.[^.][^.]*\.[^.][^.]*$' # # [:digit:] is one of the character classes #+ introduced with the POSIX 1003.2 standard. # Thanks, Stéphane Chazelas. Note The -exec option to find should not be confused with the exec shell builtin. Example 16-3. Badname, eliminate file names in current directory containing bad characters and whitespace. #!/bin/bash # badname.sh # Delete filenames in current directory containing bad characters. for filename in * do badname=`echo &quot;$filename&quot; | sed -n /[\+\{\;\&quot;\\\=\?~\(\)\&lt;\&gt;\&amp;\*\|\$]/p` # badname=`echo &quot;$filename&quot; | sed -n '/[+{;&quot;\=?~()&lt;&gt;&amp;*|$]/p'` also works. # Deletes files containing these nasties: + { ; &quot; \ = ? ~ ( ) &lt; &gt; &amp; * | $ # rm $badname 2&gt;/dev/null # ^^^^^^^^^^^ Error messages deep-sixed. done # Now, take care of files containing all manner of whitespace. find . -name &quot;* *&quot; -exec rm -f {} \; # The path name of the file that _find_ finds replaces the &quot;{}&quot;. # The '\' ensures that the ';' is interpreted literally, as end of command. exit 0 #--------------------------------------------------------------------- # Commands below this line will not execute because of _exit_ command. # An alternative to the above script: find . -name '*[+{;&quot;\\=?~()&lt;&gt;&amp;*|$ ]*' -maxdepth 0 \ -exec rm -f '{}' \; # The &quot;-maxdepth 0&quot; option ensures that _find_ will not search #+ subdirectories below $PWD. # (Thanks, S.C.)

Its manpage provides more detail on this complex and powerful command. xargs A filter for feeding arguments to a command, and also a tool for assembling the commands themselves. It breaks a data stream into small enough chunks for filters and commands to process. Consider it as a powerful replacement for backquotes. In situations where command substitution fails with a too many arguments error, substituting xargs often works. [73] Normally, xargs reads from stdin or from a pipe, but it can also be given the output of a file. The default command for xargs is echo. This means that input piped to xargs may have linefeeds and other whitespace characters stripped out. bash$ ls -l total 0 -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Jan 29 23:58 file1 -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Jan 29 23:58 file2 bash$ ls -l | xargs total 0 -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Jan 29 23:58 file1 -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Jan... bash$ find ~/mail -type f | xargs grep &quot;Linux&quot; ./misc:User-Agent: slrn/0.9.8.1 (Linux) ./sent-mail-jul-2005: hosted by the Linux Documentation Project. ./sent-mail-jul-2005: (Linux Documentation Project Site, rtf version) ./sent-mail-jul-2005: Subject: Criticism of Bozo's Windows/Linux article ./sent-mail-jul-2005: while mentioning that the Linux ext2/ext3 filesystem . . . ls | xargs -p -l gzip gzips every file in current directory, one at a time, prompting before each operation.

Tip An interesting xargs option is -n NN, which limits to NN the number of arguments passed. ls | xargs -n 8 echo lists the files in the current directory in 8 columns. Tip Another useful option is -0, in combination with find -print0 or grep -lZ. This allows handling arguments containing whitespace or quotes. find / -type f -print0 | xargs -0 grep -liwZ GUI | xargs -0 rm -f grep -rliwZ GUI / | xargs -0 rm -f Either of the above will remove any file containing &quot;GUI&quot;.

Tip The -P option to xargs permits running processes in parallel. This speeds up execution in a machine with a multicore CPU. #!/bin/bash ls *gif | xargs -t -n1 -P2 gif2png # Converts all the gif images in current directory to png. # Options: # ======= # -t Print command to stderr. # -n1 At most 1 argument per command line. # -P2 Run up to 2 processes simultaneously. # Thank you, Roberto Polli, for the inspiration.

Operations may be arithmetic, comparison, string, or logical. expr 3 + 5 returns 8 expr 5 % 3 returns 2 expr 1 / 0 returns the error message, expr: division by zero Illegal arithmetic operations not allowed. expr 5 \* 3 returns 15 The multiplication operator must be escaped when used in an arithmetic expression with expr. y=`expr $y + 1` Increment a variable, with the same effect as let y=y+1 and y=$(($y+1)). This is an example of arithmetic expansion. z=`expr substr $string $position $length` Extract substring of $length characters, starting at $position. Example 16-9.

For example, b=`expr $a : [0-9]*` is the exact equivalent of b=`expr match $a [0-9]*` in the above listing. #!/bin/bash echo echo &quot;String operations using \&quot;expr \$string : \&quot; construct&quot; echo &quot;===================================================&quot; echo a=1234zipper5FLIPPER43231 echo &quot;The string being operated upon is \&quot;`expr &quot;$a&quot; : '\(.*\)'`\&quot;.&quot; # Escaped parentheses grouping operator. == == # *************************** #+ Escaped parentheses #+ match a substring # *************************** # If no escaped parentheses ... #+ then 'expr' converts the string operand to an integer. echo &quot;Length of \&quot;$a\&quot; is `expr &quot;$a&quot; : '.*'`.&quot; # Length of string echo &quot;Number of digits at the beginning of \&quot;$a\&quot; is `expr &quot;$a&quot; : '[0-9]*'`.&quot; # ------------------------------------------------------------------------- # echo echo &quot;The digits at the beginning of \&quot;$a\&quot; are `expr &quot;$a&quot; : '\([0-9]*\)'`.&quot; # == == echo &quot;The first 7 characters of \&quot;$a\&quot; are `expr &quot;$a&quot; : '\(.......\)'`.&quot; # ===== == == # Again, escaped parentheses force a substring match. # echo &quot;The last 7 characters of \&quot;$a\&quot; are `expr &quot;$a&quot; : '.*\(.......\)'`.&quot; # ==== end of string operator ^^ # (In fact, means skip over one or more of any characters until specified #+ substring found.) echo exit 0 The above script illustrates how expr uses the escaped parentheses -- \( ... \) -- grouping operator in tandem with regular expression parsing to match a substring. Here is a another example, this time from &quot;real life.&quot; # Strip the whitespace from the beginning and end. LRFDATE=`expr &quot;$LRFDATE&quot; : '[[:space:]]*\(.*\)[[:space:]]*$'` # From Peter Knowles' &quot;booklistgen.sh&quot; script #+ for converting files to Sony Librie/PRS-50X format. # (http://booklistgensh.peterknowles.com) Perl, sed, and awk have far superior string parsing facilities. A short sed or awk &quot;subroutine&quot; within a script (see Section 36.2) is an attractive alternative to expr. See Section 10.1 for more on using expr in string operations. 16.3. Time / Date Commands Time/date and timing date Simply invoked, date prints the date and time to stdout. Where this command gets interesting is in its formatting and parsing options. Example 16-10. Using date #!/bin/bash # Exercising the 'date' command echo &quot;The number of days since the year's beginning is `date +%j`.&quot; # Needs a leading '+' to invoke formatting. # %j gives day of year. echo &quot;The number of seconds elapsed since 01/01/1970 is `date +%s`.&quot; # %s yields number of seconds since &quot;UNIX epoch&quot; began, #+ but how is this useful? prefix=temp suffix=$(date +%s) # The &quot;+%s&quot; option to 'date' is GNU-specific. filename=$prefix.$suffix echo &quot;Temporary filename = $filename&quot; # It's great for creating &quot;unique and random&quot; temp filenames, #+ even better than using $$. # Read the 'date' man page for more formatting options. exit 0 The -u option gives the UTC (Universal Coordinated Time). bash$ date Fri Mar 29 21:07:39 MST 2002 bash$ date -u Sat Mar 30 04:07:42 UTC 2002 This option facilitates calculating the time between different dates. Example 16-11. Date calculations #!/bin/bash # date-calc.sh # Author: Nathan Coulter # Used in ABS Guide with permission (thanks!). MPHR=60 # Minutes per hour. HPD=24 # Hours per day. diff () { printf '%s' $(( $(date -u -d&quot;$TARGET&quot; +%s) - $(date -u -d&quot;$CURRENT&quot; +%s))) # %d = day of month. } CURRENT=$(date -u -d '2007-09-01 17:30:24' '+%F %T.%N %Z') TARGET=$(date -u -d'2007-12-25 12:30:00' '+%F %T.%N %Z') # %F = full date, %T = %H:%M:%S, %N = nanoseconds, %Z = time zone. printf '\nIn 2007, %s ' \ &quot;$(date -d&quot;$CURRENT + $(( $(diff) /$MPHR /$MPHR /$HPD / 2 )) days&quot; '+%d %B')&quot; # %B = name of month ^ halfway printf 'was halfway between %s ' &quot;$(date -d&quot;$CURRENT&quot; '+%d %B')&quot; printf 'and %s\n' &quot;$(date -d&quot;$TARGET&quot; '+%d %B')&quot; printf '\nOn %s at %s, there were\n' \ $(date -u -d&quot;$CURRENT&quot; +%F) $(date -u -d&quot;$CURRENT&quot; +%T) DAYS=$(( $(diff) / $MPHR / $MPHR / $HPD )) CURRENT=$(date -d&quot;$CURRENT +$DAYS days&quot; '+%F %T.%N %Z') HOURS=$(( $(diff) / $MPHR / $MPHR )) CURRENT=$(date -d&quot;$CURRENT +$HOURS hours&quot; '+%F %T.%N %Z') MINUTES=$(( $(diff) / $MPHR )) CURRENT=$(date -d&quot;$CURRENT +$MINUTES minutes&quot; '+%F %T.%N %Z') printf '%s days, %s hours, ' &quot;$DAYS&quot; &quot;$HOURS&quot; printf '%s minutes, and %s seconds ' &quot;$MINUTES&quot; &quot;$(diff)&quot; printf 'until Christmas Dinner!\n\n' # Exercise: # -------- # Rewrite the diff () function to accept passed parameters, #+ rather than using global variables. The date command has quite a number of output options. For example %N gives the nanosecond portion of the current time. One interesting use for this is to generate random integers. date +%N | sed -e 's/000$//' -e 's/^0//' ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ # Strip off leading and trailing zeroes, if present. # Length of generated integer depends on #+ how many zeroes stripped off. # 115281032 # 63408725 # 394504284 There are many more options (try man date). date +%j # Echoes day of the year (days elapsed since January 1). date +%k%M # Echoes hour and minute in 24-hour format, as a single digit string. # The 'TZ' parameter permits overriding the default time zone. date # Mon Mar 28 21:42:16 MST 2005 TZ=EST date # Mon Mar 28 23:42:16 EST 2005 # Thanks, Frank Kannemann and Pete Sjoberg, for the tip. SixDaysAgo=$(date --date='6 days ago') OneMonthAgo=$(date --date='1 month ago') # Four weeks back (not a month!) OneYearAgo=$(date --date='1 year ago') See also Example 3-4 and Example A-43. zdump Time zone dump: echoes the time in a specified time zone. bash$ zdump EST EST Tue Sep 18 22:09:22 2001 EST time Outputs verbose timing statistics for executing a command. time ls -l / gives something like this: real 0m0.067s user 0m0.004s sys 0m0.005s See also the very similar times command in the previous section. Note As of version 2.0 of Bash, time became a shell reserved word, with slightly altered behavior in a pipeline. touch Utility for updating access/modification times of a file to current system time or other specified time, but also useful for creating a new file. The command touch zzz will create a new file of zero length, named zzz, assuming that zzz did not previously exist. Time-stamping empty files in this way is useful for storing date information, for example in keeping track of modification times on a project. Note The touch command is equivalent to : &gt;&gt; newfile or &gt;&gt; newfile (for ordinary files). Tip Before doing a cp -u (copy/update), use touch to update the time stamp of files you don't wish overwritten. As an example, if the directory /home/bozo/tax_audit contains the files spreadsheet-051606.data, spreadsheet-051706.data, and spreadsheet-051806.data, then doing a touch spreadsheet*.data will protect these files from being overwritten by files with the same names during a cp -u /home/bozo/financial_info/spreadsheet*data /home/bozo/tax_audit. at The at job control command executes a given set of commands at a specified time. Superficially, it resembles cron, however, at is chiefly useful for one-time execution of a command set. at 2pm January 15 prompts for a set of commands to execute at that time. These commands should be shell-script compatible, since, for all practical purposes, the user is typing in an executable shell script a line at a time. Input terminates with a Ctl-D. Using either the -f option or input redirection (&lt;), at reads a command list from a file. This file is an executable shell script, though it should, of course, be non-interactive. Particularly clever is including the run-parts command in the file to execute a different set of scripts. bash$ at 2:30 am Friday &lt; at-jobs.list job 2 at 2000-10-27 02:30 batch The batch job control command is similar to at, but it runs a command list when the system load drops below .8. Like at, it can read commands from a file with the -f option. The concept of batch processing dates back to the era of mainframe computers. It means running a set of commands without user intervention. cal Prints a neatly formatted monthly calendar to stdout. Will do current year or a large range of past and future years. sleep This is the shell equivalent of a wait loop. It pauses for a specified number of seconds, doing nothing. It can be useful for timing or in processes running in the background, checking for a specific event every so often (polling), as in Example 32-6. sleep 3 # Pauses 3 seconds. Note The sleep command defaults to seconds, but minute, hours, or days may also be specified. sleep 3 h # Pauses 3 hours! Note The watch command may be a better choice than sleep for running commands at timed intervals. usleep Microsleep (the u may be read as the Greek mu, or micro- prefix). This is the same as sleep, above, but &quot;sleeps&quot; in microsecond intervals. It can be used for fine-grained timing, or for polling an ongoing process at very frequent intervals. usleep 30 # Pauses 30 microseconds. This command is part of the Red Hat initscripts / rc-scripts package. Caution The usleep command does not provide particularly accurate timing, and is therefore unsuitable for critical timing loops. hwclock, clock The hwclock command accesses or adjusts the machine's hardware clock. Some options require root privileges. The /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit startup file uses hwclock to set the system time from the hardware clock at bootup. The clock command is a synonym for hwclock. 16.4. Text Processing Commands Commands affecting text and text files sort File sort utility, often used as a filter in a pipe. This command sorts a text stream or file forwards or backwards, or according to various keys or character positions. Using the -m option, it merges presorted input files. The info page lists its many capabilities and options. See Example 11-10, Example 11-11, and Example A-8. tsort Topological sort, reading in pairs of whitespace-separated strings and sorting according to input patterns. The original purpose of tsort was to sort a list of dependencies for an obsolete version of the ld linker in an &quot;ancient&quot; version of UNIX. The results of a tsort will usually differ markedly from those of the standard sort command, above. uniq This filter removes duplicate lines from a sorted file. It is often seen in a pipe coupled with sort. cat list-1 list-2 list-3 | sort | uniq &gt; final.list # Concatenates the list files, # sorts them, # removes duplicate lines, # and finally writes the result to an output file. The useful -c option prefixes each line of the input file with its number of occurrences. bash$ cat testfile This line occurs only once. This line occurs twice. This line occurs twice. This line occurs three times. This line occurs three times. This line occurs three times. bash$ uniq -c testfile 1 This line occurs only once. 2 This line occurs twice. 3 This line occurs three times. bash$ sort testfile | uniq -c | sort -nr 3 This line occurs three times. 2 This line occurs twice. 1 This line occurs only once. The sort INPUTFILE | uniq -c | sort -nr command string produces a frequency of occurrence listing on the INPUTFILE file (the -nr options to sort cause a reverse numerical sort). This template finds use in analysis of log files and dictionary lists, and wherever the lexical structure of a document needs to be examined. Example 16-12. Word Frequency Analysis #!/bin/bash # wf.sh: Crude word frequency analysis on a text file. # This is a more efficient version of the &quot;wf2.sh&quot; script. # Check for input file on command-line. ARGS=1 E_BADARGS=85 E_NOFILE=86 if [ $# -ne &quot;$ARGS&quot; ] # Correct number of arguments passed to script? then echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` filename&quot; exit $E_BADARGS fi if [ ! -f &quot;$1&quot; ] # Check if file exists. then echo &quot;File \&quot;$1\&quot; does not exist.&quot; exit $E_NOFILE fi ######################################################## # main () sed -e 's/\.//g' -e 's/\,//g' -e 's/ /\ /g' &quot;$1&quot; | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr # ========================= # Frequency of occurrence # Filter out periods and commas, and #+ change space between words to linefeed, #+ then shift characters to lowercase, and #+ finally prefix occurrence count and sort numerically. # Arun Giridhar suggests modifying the above to: # . . . | sort | uniq -c | sort +1 [-f] | sort +0 -nr # This adds a secondary sort key, so instances of #+ equal occurrence are sorted alphabetically. # As he explains it: # &quot;This is effectively a radix sort, first on the #+ least significant column #+ (word or string, optionally case-insensitive) #+ and last on the most significant column (frequency).&quot; # # As Frank Wang explains, the above is equivalent to #+ . . . | sort | uniq -c | sort +0 -nr #+ and the following also works: #+ . . . | sort | uniq -c | sort -k1nr -k ######################################################## exit 0 # Exercises: # --------- # 1) Add 'sed' commands to filter out other punctuation, #+ such as semicolons. # 2) Modify the script to also filter out multiple spaces and #+ other whitespace. bash$ cat testfile This line occurs only once. This line occurs twice. This line occurs twice. This line occurs three times. This line occurs three times. This line occurs three times. bash$ ./wf.sh testfile 6 this 6 occurs 6 line 3 times 3 three 2 twice 1 only 1 once expand, unexpand The expand filter converts tabs to spaces. It is often used in a pipe. The unexpand filter converts spaces to tabs. This reverses the effect of expand. cut A tool for extracting fields from files. It is similar to the print $N command set in awk, but more limited. It may be simpler to use cut in a script than awk. Particularly important are the -d (delimiter) and -f (field specifier) options. Using cut to obtain a listing of the mounted filesystems: cut -d ' ' -f1,2 /etc/mtab Using cut to list the OS and kernel version: uname -a | cut -d&quot; &quot; -f1,3,11,12 Using cut to extract message headers from an e-mail folder: bash$ grep '^Subject:' read-messages | cut -c10-80 Re: Linux suitable for mission-critical apps? MAKE MILLIONS WORKING AT HOME!!! Spam complaint Re: Spam complaint Using cut to parse a file: # List all the users in /etc/passwd. FILENAME=/etc/passwd for user in $(cut -d: -f1 $FILENAME) do echo $user done # Thanks, Oleg Philon for suggesting this. cut -d ' ' -f2,3 filename is equivalent to awk -F'[ ]' '{ print $2, $3 }' filename Note It is even possible to specify a linefeed as a delimiter. The trick is to actually embed a linefeed (RETURN) in the command sequence. bash$ cut -d' ' -f3,7,19 testfile This is line 3 of testfile. This is line 7 of testfile. This is line 19 of testfile. Thank you, Jaka Kranjc, for pointing this out. See also Example 16-48. paste Tool for merging together different files into a single, multi-column file. In combination with cut, useful for creating system log files. bash$ cat items alphabet blocks building blocks cables bash$ cat prices $1.00/dozen $2.50 ea. $3.75 bash$ paste items prices alphabet blocks $1.00/dozen building blocks $2.50 ea. cables $3.75 join Consider this a special-purpose cousin of paste. This powerful utility allows merging two files in a meaningful fashion, which essentially creates a simple version of a relational database. The join command operates on exactly two files, but pastes together only those lines with a common tagged field (usually a numerical label), and writes the result to stdout. The files to be joined should be sorted according to the tagged field for the matchups to work properly. File: 1.data 100 Shoes 200 Laces 300 Socks File: 2.data 100 $40.00 200 $1.00 300 $2.00 bash$ join 1.data 2.data File: 1.data 2.data 100 Shoes $40.00 200 Laces $1.00 300 Socks $2.00 Note The tagged field appears only once in the output. head lists the beginning of a file to stdout. The default is 10 lines, but a different number can be specified. The command has a number of interesting options. Example 16-13. Which files are scripts? #!/bin/bash # script-detector.sh: Detects scripts within a directory. TESTCHARS=2 # Test first 2 characters. SHABANG='#!' # Scripts begin with a &quot;sha-bang.&quot; for file in * # Traverse all the files in current directory. do if [[ `head -c$TESTCHARS &quot;$file&quot;` = &quot;$SHABANG&quot; ]] # head -c2 #! # The '-c' option to &quot;head&quot; outputs a specified #+ number of characters, rather than lines (the default). then echo &quot;File \&quot;$file\&quot; is a script.&quot; else echo &quot;File \&quot;$file\&quot; is *not* a script.&quot; fi done exit 0 # Exercises: # --------- # 1) Modify this script to take as an optional argument #+ the directory to scan for scripts #+ (rather than just the current working directory). # # 2) As it stands, this script gives &quot;false positives&quot; for #+ Perl, awk, and other scripting language scripts. # Correct this. Example 16-14. Generating 10-digit random numbers #!/bin/bash # rnd.sh: Outputs a 10-digit random number # Script by Stephane Chazelas. head -c4 /dev/urandom | od -N4 -tu4 | sed -ne '1s/.* //p' # =================================================================== # # Analysis # -------- # head: # -c4 option takes first 4 bytes. # od: # -N4 option limits output to 4 bytes. # -tu4 option selects unsigned decimal format for output. # sed: # -n option, in combination with &quot;p&quot; flag to the &quot;s&quot; command, # outputs only matched lines. # The author of this script explains the action of 'sed', as follows. # head -c4 /dev/urandom | od -N4 -tu4 | sed -ne '1s/.* //p' # ----------------------------------&gt; | # Assume output up to &quot;sed&quot; --------&gt; | # is 0000000 1198195154\n # sed begins reading characters: 0000000 1198195154\n. # Here it finds a newline character, #+ so it is ready to process the first line (0000000 1198195154). # It looks at its &lt;range&gt;&lt;action&gt;s. The first and only one is # range action # 1 s/.* //p # The line number is in the range, so it executes the action: #+ tries to substitute the longest string ending with a space in the line # (&quot;0000000 &quot;) with nothing (//), and if it succeeds, prints the result # (&quot;p&quot; is a flag to the &quot;s&quot; command here, this is different #+ from the &quot;p&quot; command). # sed is now ready to continue reading its input. (Note that before #+ continuing, if -n option had not been passed, sed would have printed #+ the line once again). # Now, sed reads the remainder of the characters, and finds the #+ end of the file. # It is now ready to process its 2nd line (which is also numbered '$' as #+ it's the last one). # It sees it is not matched by any &lt;range&gt;, so its job is done. # In few word this sed commmand means: # &quot;On the first line only, remove any character up to the right-most space, #+ then print it.&quot; # A better way to do this would have been: # sed -e 's/.* //;q' # Here, two &lt;range&gt;&lt;action&gt;s (could have been written # sed -e 's/.* //' -e q): # range action # nothing (matches line) s/.* // # nothing (matches line) q (quit) # Here, sed only reads its first line of input. # It performs both actions, and prints the line (substituted) before #+ quitting (because of the &quot;q&quot; action) since the &quot;-n&quot; option is not passed. # =================================================================== # # An even simpler altenative to the above one-line script would be: # head -c4 /dev/urandom| od -An -tu4 exit See also Example 16-39. tail lists the (tail) end of a file to stdout. The default is 10 lines, but this can be changed with the -n option. Commonly used to keep track of changes to a system logfile, using the -f option, which outputs lines appended to the file. Example 16-15. Using tail to monitor the system log #!/bin/bash filename=sys.log cat /dev/null &gt; $filename; echo &quot;Creating / cleaning out file.&quot; # Creates the file if it does not already exist, #+ and truncates it to zero length if it does. # : &gt; filename and &gt; filename also work. tail /var/log/messages &gt; $filename # /var/log/messages must have world read permission for this to work. echo &quot;$filename contains tail end of system log.&quot; exit 0 Tip To list a specific line of a text file, pipe the output of head to tail -n 1. For example head -n 8 database.txt | tail -n 1 lists the 8th line of the file database.txt. To set a variable to a given block of a text file: var=$(head -n $m $filename | tail -n $n) # filename = name of file # m = from beginning of file, number of lines to end of block # n = number of lines to set variable to (trim from end of block) Note Newer implementations of tail deprecate the older tail -$LINES filename usage. The standard tail -n $LINES filename is correct. See also Example 16-5, Example 16-39 and Example 32-6. grep A multi-purpose file search tool that uses Regular Expressions. It was originally a command/filter in the venerable ed line editor: g/re/p -- global - regular expression - print. grep pattern [file...] Search the target file(s) for occurrences of pattern, where pattern may be literal text or a Regular Expression. bash$ grep '[rst]ystem.$' osinfo.txt The GPL governs the distribution of the Linux operating system. If no target file(s) specified, grep works as a filter on stdout, as in a pipe. bash$ ps ax | grep clock 765 tty1 S 0:00 xclock 901 pts/1 S 0:00 grep clock The -i option causes a case-insensitive search. The -w option matches only whole words. The -l option lists only the files in which matches were found, but not the matching lines. The -r (recursive) option searches files in the current working directory and all subdirectories below it. The -n option lists the matching lines, together with line numbers. bash$ grep -n Linux osinfo.txt 2:This is a file containing information about Linux. 6:The GPL governs the distribution of the Linux operating system. The -v (or --invert-match) option filters out matches. grep pattern1 *.txt | grep -v pattern2 # Matches all lines in &quot;*.txt&quot; files containing &quot;pattern1&quot;, # but ***not*** &quot;pattern2&quot;. The -c (--count) option gives a numerical count of matches, rather than actually listing the matches. grep -c txt *.sgml # (number of occurrences of &quot;txt&quot; in &quot;*.sgml&quot; files) # grep -cz . # ^ dot # means count (-c) zero-separated (-z) items matching &quot;.&quot; # that is, non-empty ones (containing at least 1 character). # printf 'a b\nc d\n\n\n\n\n\000\n\000e\000\000\nf' | grep -cz . # 3 printf 'a b\nc d\n\n\n\n\n\000\n\000e\000\000\nf' | grep -cz '$' # 5 printf 'a b\nc d\n\n\n\n\n\000\n\000e\000\000\nf' | grep -cz '^' # 5 # printf 'a b\nc d\n\n\n\n\n\000\n\000e\000\000\nf' | grep -c '$' # 9 # By default, newline chars (\n) separate items to match. # Note that the -z option is GNU &quot;grep&quot; specific. # Thanks, S.C. The --color (or --colour) option marks the matching string in color (on the console or in an xterm window). Since grep prints out each entire line containing the matching pattern, this lets you see exactly what is being matched. See also the -o option, which shows only the matching portion of the line(s). Example 16-16. Printing out the From lines in stored e-mail messages #!/bin/bash # from.sh # Emulates the useful 'from' utility in Solaris, BSD, etc. # Echoes the &quot;From&quot; header line in all messages #+ in your e-mail directory. MAILDIR=~/mail/* # No quoting of variable. Why? # Maybe check if-exists $MAILDIR: if [ -d $MAILDIR ] . . . GREP_OPTS=&quot;-H -A 5 --color&quot; # Show file, plus extra context lines #+ and display &quot;From&quot; in color. TARGETSTR=&quot;^From&quot; # &quot;From&quot; at beginning of line. for file in $MAILDIR # No quoting of variable. do grep $GREP_OPTS &quot;$TARGETSTR&quot; &quot;$file&quot; # ^^^^^^^^^^ # Again, do not quote this variable. echo done exit $? # You might wish to pipe the output of this script to 'more' #+ or redirect it to a file . . . When invoked with more than one target file given, grep specifies which file contains matches. bash$ grep Linux osinfo.txt misc.txt osinfo.txt:This is a file containing information about Linux. osinfo.txt:The GPL governs the distribution of the Linux operating system. misc.txt:The Linux operating system is steadily gaining in popularity. Tip To force grep to show the filename when searching only one target file, simply give /dev/null as the second file. bash$ grep Linux osinfo.txt /dev/null osinfo.txt:This is a file containing information about Linux. osinfo.txt:The GPL governs the distribution of the Linux operating system. If there is a successful match, grep returns an exit status of 0, which makes it useful in a condition test in a script, especially in combination with the -q option to suppress output. SUCCESS=0 # if grep lookup succeeds word=Linux filename=data.file grep -q &quot;$word&quot; &quot;$filename&quot; # The &quot;-q&quot; option #+ causes nothing to echo to stdout. if [ $? -eq $SUCCESS ] # if grep -q &quot;$word&quot; &quot;$filename&quot; can replace lines 5 - 7. then echo &quot;$word found in $filename&quot; else echo &quot;$word not found in $filename&quot; fi Example 32-6 demonstrates how to use grep to search for a word pattern in a system logfile. Example 16-17. Emulating grep in a script #!/bin/bash # grp.sh: Rudimentary reimplementation of grep. E_BADARGS=85 if [ -z &quot;$1&quot; ] # Check for argument to script. then echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` pattern&quot; exit $E_BADARGS fi echo for file in * # Traverse all files in $PWD. do output=$(sed -n /&quot;$1&quot;/p $file) # Command substitution. if [ ! -z &quot;$output&quot; ] # What happens if &quot;$output&quot; is not quoted? then echo -n &quot;$file: &quot; echo &quot;$output&quot; fi # sed -ne &quot;/$1/s|^|${file}: |p&quot; is equivalent to above. echo done echo exit 0 # Exercises: # --------- # 1) Add newlines to output, if more than one match in any given file. # 2) Add features. How can grep search for two (or more) separate patterns? What if you want grep to display all lines in a file or files that contain both &quot;pattern1&quot; and &quot;pattern2&quot;? One method is to pipe the result of grep pattern1 to grep pattern2. For example, given the following file: # Filename: tstfile This is a sample file. This is an ordinary text file. This file does not contain any unusual text. This file is not unusual. Here is some text. Now, let's search this file for lines containing both &quot;file&quot; and &quot;text&quot; . . . bash$ grep file tstfile # Filename: tstfile This is a sample file. This is an ordinary text file. This file does not contain any unusual text. This file is not unusual. bash$ grep file tstfile | grep text This is an ordinary text file. This file does not contain any unusual text. Now, for an interesting recreational use of grep . . . Example 16-18. Crossword puzzle solver #!/bin/bash # cw-solver.sh # This is actually a wrapper around a one-liner (line 46). # Crossword puzzle and anagramming word game solver. # You know *some* of the letters in the word you're looking for, #+ so you need a list of all valid words #+ with the known letters in given positions. # For example: w...i....n # 1???5????10 # w in position 1, 3 unknowns, i in the 5th, 4 unknowns, n at the end. # (See comments at end of script.) E_NOPATT=71 DICT=/usr/share/dict/word.lst # ^^^^^^^^ Looks for word list here. # ASCII word list, one word per line. # If you happen to need an appropriate list, #+ download the author's &quot;yawl&quot; word list package. # http://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/libs/yawl-0.3.2.tar.gz # or # http://bash.deta.in/yawl-0.3.2.tar.gz if [ -z &quot;$1&quot; ] # If no word pattern specified then #+ as a command-line argument . . . echo #+ . . . then . . . echo &quot;Usage:&quot; #+ Usage message. echo echo &quot;&quot;$0&quot; \&quot;pattern,\&quot;&quot; echo &quot;where \&quot;pattern\&quot; is in the form&quot; echo &quot;xxx..x.x...&quot; echo echo &quot;The x's represent known letters,&quot; echo &quot;and the periods are unknown letters (blanks).&quot; echo &quot;Letters and periods can be in any position.&quot; echo &quot;For example, try: sh cw-solver.sh w...i....n&quot; echo exit $E_NOPATT fi echo # =============================================== # This is where all the work gets done. grep ^&quot;$1&quot;$ &quot;$DICT&quot; # Yes, only one line! # | | # ^ is start-of-word regex anchor. # $ is end-of-word regex anchor. # From _Stupid Grep Tricks_, vol. 1, #+ a book the ABS Guide author may yet get around #+ to writing . . . one of these days . . . # =============================================== echo exit $? # Script terminates here. # If there are too many words generated, #+ redirect the output to a file. $ sh cw-solver.sh w...i....n wellington workingman workingmen egrep -- extended grep -- is the same as grep -E. This uses a somewhat different, extended set of Regular Expressions, which can make the search a bit more flexible. It also allows the boolean | (or) operator. bash $ egrep 'matches|Matches' file.txt Line 1 matches. Line 3 Matches. Line 4 contains matches, but also Matches fgrep -- fast grep -- is the same as grep -F. It does a literal string search (no Regular Expressions), which generally speeds things up a bit. Note On some Linux distros, egrep and fgrep are symbolic links to, or aliases for grep, but invoked with the -E and -F options, respectively. Example 16-19. Looking up definitions in Webster's 1913 Dictionary #!/bin/bash # dict-lookup.sh # This script looks up definitions in the 1913 Webster's Dictionary. # This Public Domain dictionary is available for download #+ from various sites, including #+ Project Gutenberg (http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/247). # # Convert it from DOS to UNIX format (with only LF at end of line) #+ before using it with this script. # Store the file in plain, uncompressed ASCII text. # Set DEFAULT_DICTFILE variable below to path/filename.

Note See also Example A-41 for an example of speedy fgrep lookup on a large text file. agrep (approximate grep) extends the capabilities of grep to approximate matching. The search string may differ by a specified number of characters from the resulting matches. This utility is not part of the core Linux distribution. Tip To search compressed files, use zgrep, zegrep, or zfgrep. These also work on non-compressed files, though slower than plain grep, egrep, fgrep. They are handy for searching through a mixed set of files, some compressed, some not. To search bzipped files, use bzgrep. look The command look works like grep, but does a lookup on a &quot;dictionary,&quot; a sorted word list. By default, look searches for a match in /usr/dict/words, but a different dictionary file may be specified. Example 16-20. Checking words in a list for validity #!/bin/bash # lookup: Does a dictionary lookup on each word in a data file. file=words.data # Data file from which to read words to test. echo echo &quot;Testing file $file&quot; echo while [ &quot;$word&quot; != end ] # Last word in data file. do # ^^^ read word # From data file, because of redirection at end of loop. look $word &gt; /dev/null # Don't want to display lines in dictionary file. # Searches for words in the file /usr/share/dict/words #+ (usually a link to linux.words). lookup=$? # Exit status of 'look' command. if [ &quot;$lookup&quot; -eq 0 ] then echo &quot;\&quot;$word\&quot; is valid.&quot; else echo &quot;\&quot;$word\&quot; is invalid.&quot; fi done &lt;&quot;$file&quot; # Redirects stdin to $file, so &quot;reads&quot; come from there. echo exit 0 # ---------------------------------------------------------------- # Code below line will not execute because of &quot;exit&quot; command above. # Stephane Chazelas proposes the following, more concise alternative: while read word &amp;&amp; [[ $word != end ]] do if look &quot;$word&quot; &gt; /dev/null then echo &quot;\&quot;$word\&quot; is valid.&quot; else echo &quot;\&quot;$word\&quot; is invalid.&quot; fi done &lt;&quot;$file&quot; exit 0 sed, awk Scripting languages especially suited for parsing text files and command output. May be embedded singly or in combination in pipes and shell scripts. sed Non-interactive &quot;stream editor&quot;, permits using many ex commands in batch mode. It finds many uses in shell scripts. awk Programmable file extractor and formatter, good for manipulating and/or extracting fields (columns) in structured text files. Its syntax is similar to C. wc wc gives a &quot;word count&quot; on a file or I/O stream: bash $ wc /usr/share/doc/sed-4.1.2/README 13 70 447 README [13 lines 70 words 447 characters] wc -w gives only the word count. wc -l gives only the line count. wc -c gives only the byte count. wc -m gives only the character count. wc -L gives only the length of the longest line. Using wc to count how many .txt files are in current working directory: $ ls *.txt | wc -l # Will work as long as none of the &quot;*.txt&quot; files #+ have a linefeed embedded in their name. # Alternative ways of doing this are: # find . -maxdepth 1 -name \*.txt -print0 | grep -cz . # (shopt -s nullglob; set -- *.txt; echo $#) # Thanks, S.C. Using wc to total up the size of all the files whose names begin with letters in the range d - h bash$ wc [d-h]* | grep total | awk '{print $3}' 71832 Using wc to count the instances of the word &quot;Linux&quot; in the main source file for this book. bash$ grep Linux abs-book.sgml | wc -l 138 See also Example 16-39 and Example 20-8. Certain commands include some of the functionality of wc as options. ... | grep foo | wc -l # This frequently used construct can be more concisely rendered. ... | grep -c foo # Just use the &quot;-c&quot; (or &quot;--count&quot;) option of grep. # Thanks, S.C. tr character translation filter. Caution Must use quoting and/or brackets, as appropriate. Quotes prevent the shell from reinterpreting the special characters in tr command sequences. Brackets should be quoted to prevent expansion by the shell. Either tr &quot;A-Z&quot; &quot;*&quot; &lt;filename or tr A-Z \* &lt;filename changes all the uppercase letters in filename to asterisks (writes to stdout). On some systems this may not work, but tr A-Z '[**]' will. The -d option deletes a range of characters. echo &quot;abcdef&quot; # abcdef echo &quot;abcdef&quot; | tr -d b-d # aef tr -d 0-9 &lt;filename # Deletes all digits from the file &quot;filename&quot;. The --squeeze-repeats (or -s) option deletes all but the first instance of a string of consecutive characters. This option is useful for removing excess whitespace. bash$ echo &quot;XXXXX&quot; | tr --squeeze-repeats 'X' X The -c &quot;complement&quot; option inverts the character set to match. With this option, tr acts only upon those characters not matching the specified set. bash$ echo &quot;acfdeb123&quot; | tr -c b-d + +c+d+b++++ Note that tr recognizes POSIX character classes. [74] bash$ echo &quot;abcd2ef1&quot; | tr '[:alpha:]' - ----2--1 Example 16-21. toupper: Transforms a file to all uppercase. #!/bin/bash # Changes a file to all uppercase.

The BSD version does not use brackets (tr a-z A-Z), but the SysV one does (tr '[a-z]' '[A-Z]'). The GNU version of tr resembles the BSD one. fold A filter that wraps lines of input to a specified width. This is especially useful with the -s option, which breaks lines at word spaces (see Example 16-26 and Example A-1). fmt Simple-minded file formatter, used as a filter in a pipe to &quot;wrap&quot; long lines of text output. Example 16-26. Formatted file listing. #!/bin/bash WIDTH=40 # 40 columns wide. b=`ls /usr/local/bin` # Get a file listing... echo $b | fmt -w $WIDTH # Could also have been done by # echo $b | fold - -s -w $WIDTH exit 0 See also Example 16-5. Tip A powerful alternative to fmt is Kamil Toman's par utility, available from http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~amc/Par/. col This deceptively named filter removes reverse line feeds from an input stream. It also attempts to replace whitespace with equivalent tabs. The chief use of col is in filtering the output from certain text processing utilities, such as groff and tbl. column Column formatter. This filter transforms list-type text output into a &quot;pretty-printed&quot; table by inserting tabs at appropriate places. Example 16-27. Using column to format a directory listing #!/bin/bash # colms.sh # A minor modification of the example file in the &quot;column&quot; man page. (printf &quot;PERMISSIONS LINKS OWNER GROUP SIZE MONTH DAY HH:MM PROG-NAME\n&quot; \ ; ls -l | sed 1d) | column -t # ^^^^^^ ^^ # The &quot;sed 1d&quot; in the pipe deletes the first line of output, #+ which would be &quot;total N&quot;, #+ where &quot;N&quot; is the total number of files found by &quot;ls -l&quot;. # The -t option to &quot;column&quot; pretty-prints a table. exit 0 colrm Column removal filter. This removes columns (characters) from a file and writes the file, lacking the range of specified columns, back to stdout. colrm 2 4 &lt;filename removes the second through fourth characters from each line of the text file filename. Caution If the file contains tabs or nonprintable characters, this may cause unpredictable behavior. In such cases, consider using expand and unexpand in a pipe preceding colrm. nl Line numbering filter: nl filename lists filename to stdout, but inserts consecutive numbers at the beginning of each non-blank line. If filename omitted, operates on stdin. The output of nl is very similar to cat -b, since, by default nl does not list blank lines. Example 16-28. nl: A self-numbering script. #!/bin/bash # line-number.sh # This script echoes itself twice to stdout with its lines numbered. echo &quot; line number = $LINENO&quot; # 'nl' sees this as line 4 # (nl does not number blank lines). # 'cat -n' sees it correctly as line #6. nl `basename $0` echo; echo # Now, let's try it with 'cat -n' cat -n `basename $0` # The difference is that 'cat -n' numbers the blank lines. # Note that 'nl -ba' will also do so. exit 0 # ----------------------------------------------------------------- pr Print formatting filter. This will paginate files (or stdout) into sections suitable for hard copy printing or viewing on screen. Various options permit row and column manipulation, joining lines, setting margins, numbering lines, adding page headers, and merging files, among other things. The pr command combines much of the functionality of nl, paste, fold, column, and expand. pr -o 5 --width=65 fileZZZ | more gives a nice paginated listing to screen of fileZZZ with margins set at 5 and 65. A particularly useful option is -d, forcing double-spacing (same effect as sed -G). gettext The GNU gettext package is a set of utilities for localizing and translating the text output of programs into foreign languages. While originally intended for C programs, it now supports quite a number of programming and scripting languages. The gettext program works on shell scripts. See the info page. msgfmt A program for generating binary message catalogs. It is used for localization. iconv A utility for converting file(s) to a different encoding (character set). Its chief use is for localization. # Convert a string from UTF-8 to UTF-16 and print to the BookList function write_utf8_string { STRING=$1 BOOKLIST=$2 echo -n &quot;$STRING&quot; | iconv -f UTF8 -t UTF16 | \ cut -b 3- | tr -d \\n &gt;&gt; &quot;$BOOKLIST&quot; } # From Peter Knowles' &quot;booklistgen.sh&quot; script #+ for converting files to Sony Librie/PRS-50X format. # (http://booklistgensh.peterknowles.com) recode Consider this a fancier version of iconv, above. This very versatile utility for converting a file to a different encoding scheme. Note that recode is not part of the standard Linux installation. TeX, gs TeX and Postscript are text markup languages used for preparing copy for printing or formatted video display. TeX is Donald Knuth's elaborate typsetting system. It is often convenient to write a shell script encapsulating all the options and arguments passed to one of these markup languages. Ghostscript (gs) is a GPL-ed Postscript interpreter. texexec Utility for processing TeX and pdf files. Found in /usr/bin on many Linux distros, it is actually a shell wrapper that calls Perl to invoke Tex. texexec --pdfarrange --result=Concatenated.pdf *pdf # Concatenates all the pdf files in the current working directory #+ into the merged file, Concatenated.pdf . . . # (The --pdfarrange option repaginates a pdf file. See also --pdfcombine.) # The above command-line could be parameterized and put into a shell script. enscript Utility for converting plain text file to PostScript For example, enscript filename.txt -p filename.ps produces the PostScript output file filename.ps. groff, tbl, eqn Yet another text markup and display formatting language is groff. This is the enhanced GNU version of the venerable UNIX roff/troff display and typesetting package. Manpages use groff. The tbl table processing utility is considered part of groff, as its function is to convert table markup into groff commands. The eqn equation processing utility is likewise part of groff, and its function is to convert equation markup into groff commands. Example 16-29. manview: Viewing formatted manpages #!/bin/bash # manview.sh: Formats the source of a man page for viewing. # This script is useful when writing man page source. # It lets you look at the intermediate results on the fly #+ while working on it.

See also Example A-39. lex, yacc The lex lexical analyzer produces programs for pattern matching. This has been replaced by the nonproprietary flex on Linux systems. The yacc utility creates a parser based on a set of specifications. This has been replaced by the nonproprietary bison on Linux systems. 16.5. File and Archiving Commands Archiving tar The standard UNIX archiving utility. [75] Originally a Tape ARchiving program, it has developed into a general purpose package that can handle all manner of archiving with all types of destination devices, ranging from tape drives to regular files to even stdout (see Example 3-4). GNU tar has been patched to accept various compression filters, for example: tar czvf archive_name.tar.gz *, which recursively archives and gzips all files in a directory tree except dotfiles in the current working directory ($PWD). [76] Some useful tar options: -c create (a new archive) -x extract (files from existing archive) --delete delete (files from existing archive) Caution This option will not work on magnetic tape devices. -r append (files to existing archive) -A append (tar files to existing archive) -t list (contents of existing archive) -u update archive -d compare archive with specified filesystem --after-date only process files with a date stamp after specified date -z gzip the archive (compress or uncompress, depending on whether combined with the -c or -x) option -j bzip2 the archive Caution It may be difficult to recover data from a corrupted gzipped tar archive. When archiving important files, make multiple backups. shar Shell archiving utility. The text and/or binary files in a shell archive are concatenated without compression, and the resultant archive is essentially a shell script, complete with #!/bin/sh header, containing all the necessary unarchiving commands, as well as the files themselves. Unprintable binary characters in the target file(s) are converted to printable ASCII characters in the output shar file. Shar archives still show up in Usenet newsgroups, but otherwise shar has been replaced by tar/gzip. The unshar command unpacks shar archives. The mailshar command is a Bash script that uses shar to concatenate multiple files into a single one for e-mailing. This script supports compression and uuencoding. ar Creation and manipulation utility for archives, mainly used for binary object file libraries. rpm The Red Hat Package Manager, or rpm utility provides a wrapper for source or binary archives. It includes commands for installing and checking the integrity of packages, among other things. A simple rpm -i package_name.rpm usually suffices to install a package, though there are many more options available. Tip rpm -qf identifies which package a file originates from. bash$ rpm -qf /bin/ls coreutils-5.2.1-31 Tip rpm -qa gives a complete list of all installed rpm packages on a given system. An rpm -qa package_name lists only the package(s) corresponding to package_name. bash$ rpm -qa redhat-logos-1.1.3-1 glibc-2.2.4-13 cracklib-2.7-12 dosfstools-2.7-1 gdbm-1.8.0-10 ksymoops-2.4.1-1 mktemp-1.5-11 perl-5.6.0-17 reiserfs-utils-3.x.0j-2 ... bash$ rpm -qa docbook-utils docbook-utils-0.6.9-2 bash$ rpm -qa docbook | grep docbook docbook-dtd31-sgml-1.0-10 docbook-style-dsssl-1.64-3 docbook-dtd30-sgml-1.0-10 docbook-dtd40-sgml-1.0-11 docbook-utils-pdf-0.6.9-2 docbook-dtd41-sgml-1.0-10 docbook-utils-0.6.9-2 cpio This specialized archiving copy command (copy input and output) is rarely seen any more, having been supplanted by tar/gzip. It still has its uses, such as moving a directory tree. With an appropriate block size (for copying) specified, it can be appreciably faster than tar. Example 16-30. Using cpio to move a directory tree #!/bin/bash # Copying a directory tree using cpio. # Advantages of using 'cpio': # Speed of copying. It's faster than 'tar' with pipes. # Well suited for copying special files (named pipes, etc.) #+ that 'cp' may choke on. ARGS=2 E_BADARGS=65 if [ $# -ne &quot;$ARGS&quot; ] then echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` source destination&quot; exit $E_BADARGS fi source=&quot;$1&quot; destination=&quot;$2&quot; ################################################################### find &quot;$source&quot; -depth | cpio -admvp &quot;$destination&quot; # ^^^^^ ^^^^^ # Read the 'find' and 'cpio' info pages to decipher these options. # The above works only relative to $PWD (current directory) . . . #+ full pathnames are specified. ################################################################### # Exercise: # -------- # Add code to check the exit status ($?) of the 'find | cpio' pipe #+ and output appropriate error messages if anything went wrong. exit $? rpm2cpio This command extracts a cpio archive from an rpm one. Example 16-31. Unpacking an rpm archive #!/bin/bash # de-rpm.sh: Unpack an 'rpm' archive : ${1?&quot;Usage: `basename $0` target-file&quot;} # Must specify 'rpm' archive name as an argument. TEMPFILE=$$.cpio # Tempfile with &quot;unique&quot; name. # $$ is process ID of script. rpm2cpio &lt; $1 &gt; $TEMPFILE # Converts rpm archive into #+ cpio archive. cpio --make-directories -F $TEMPFILE -i # Unpacks cpio archive. rm -f $TEMPFILE # Deletes cpio archive. exit 0 # Exercise: # Add check for whether 1) &quot;target-file&quot; exists and #+ 2) it is an rpm archive. # Hint: Parse output of 'file' command. pax The pax portable archive exchange toolkit facilitates periodic file backups and is designed to be cross-compatible between various flavors of UNIX. It was designed to replace tar and cpio. pax -wf daily_backup.pax ~/linux-server/files # Creates a tar archive of all files in the target directory. # Note that the options to pax must be in the correct order -- #+ pax -fw has an entirely different effect. pax -f daily_backup.pax # Lists the files in the archive. pax -rf daily_backup.pax ~/bsd-server/files # Restores the backed-up files from the Linux machine #+ onto a BSD one. Note that pax handles many of the standard archiving and compression commands. Compression gzip The standard GNU/UNIX compression utility, replacing the inferior and proprietary compress. The corresponding decompression command is gunzip, which is the equivalent of gzip -d. Note The -c option sends the output of gzip to stdout. This is useful when piping to other commands. The zcat filter decompresses a gzipped file to stdout, as possible input to a pipe or redirection. This is, in effect, a cat command that works on compressed files (including files processed with the older compress utility). The zcat command is equivalent to gzip -dc. Caution On some commercial UNIX systems, zcat is a synonym for uncompress -c, and will not work on gzipped files. See also Example 7-7. bzip2 An alternate compression utility, usually more efficient (but slower) than gzip, especially on large files. The corresponding decompression command is bunzip2. Similar to the zcat command, bzcat decompresses a bzipped2-ed file to stdout. Note Newer versions of tar have been patched with bzip2 support. compress, uncompress This is an older, proprietary compression utility found in commercial UNIX distributions. The more efficient gzip has largely replaced it. Linux distributions generally include a compress workalike for compatibility, although gunzip can unarchive files treated with compress. Tip The znew command transforms compressed files into gzipped ones. sq Yet another compression (squeeze) utility, a filter that works only on sorted ASCII word lists. It uses the standard invocation syntax for a filter, sq &lt; input-file &gt; output-file. Fast, but not nearly as efficient as gzip. The corresponding uncompression filter is unsq, invoked like sq. Tip The output of sq may be piped to gzip for further compression. zip, unzip Cross-platform file archiving and compression utility compatible with DOS pkzip.exe. &quot;Zipped&quot; archives seem to be a more common medium of file exchange on the Internet than &quot;tarballs.&quot; unarc, unarj, unrar These Linux utilities permit unpacking archives compressed with the DOS arc.exe, arj.exe, and rar.exe programs. lzma, unlzma, lzcat Highly efficient Lempel-Ziv-Markov compression. The syntax of lzma is similar to that of gzip. The 7-zip Website has more information. xz, unxz, xzcat A new high-efficiency compression tool, backward compatible with lzma, and with an invocation syntax similar to gzip. For more information, see the Wikipedia entry. File Information file A utility for identifying file types. The command file file-name will return a file specification for file-name, such as ascii text or data. It references the magic numbers found in /usr/share/magic, /etc/magic, or /usr/lib/magic, depending on the Linux/UNIX distribution. The -f option causes file to run in batch mode, to read from a designated file a list of filenames to analyze. The -z option, when used on a compressed target file, forces an attempt to analyze the uncompressed file type. bash$ file test.tar.gz test.tar.gz: gzip compressed data, deflated, last modified: Sun Sep 16 13:34:51 2001, os: Unix bash file -z test.tar.gz test.tar.gz: GNU tar archive (gzip compressed data, deflated, last modified: Sun Sep 16 13:34:51 2001, os: Unix) # Find sh and Bash scripts in a given directory: DIRECTORY=/usr/local/bin KEYWORD=Bourne # Bourne and Bourne-Again shell scripts file $DIRECTORY/* | fgrep $KEYWORD # Output: # /usr/local/bin/burn-cd: Bourne-Again shell script text executable # /usr/local/bin/burnit: Bourne-Again shell script text executable # /usr/local/bin/cassette.sh: Bourne shell script text executable # /usr/local/bin/copy-cd: Bourne-Again shell script text executable # . . .

This is useful for identifying system commands and important configuration files. Consider it a simplified man command. $bash whatis whatis whatis (1) - search the whatis database for complete words Example 16-33. Exploring /usr/X11R6/bin #!/bin/bash # What are all those mysterious binaries in /usr/X11R6/bin?

The effect is similar to ls -lb. This is one of the GNU fileutils. bash$ vdir total 10 -rw-r--r-- 1 bozo bozo 4034 Jul 18 22:04 data1.xrolo -rw-r--r-- 1 bozo bozo 4602 May 25 13:58 data1.xrolo.bak -rw-r--r-- 1 bozo bozo 877 Dec 17 2000 employment.xrolo bash ls -l total 10 -rw-r--r-- 1 bozo bozo 4034 Jul 18 22:04 data1.xrolo -rw-r--r-- 1 bozo bozo 4602 May 25 13:58 data1.xrolo.bak -rw-r--r-- 1 bozo bozo 877 Dec 17 2000 employment.xrolo locate, slocate The locate command searches for files using a database stored for just that purpose. The slocate command is the secure version of locate (which may be aliased to slocate). $bash locate hickson /usr/lib/xephem/catalogs/hickson.edb getfacl, setfacl These commands retrieve or set the file access control list -- the owner, group, and file permissions. bash$ getfacl * # file: test1.txt # owner: bozo # group: bozgrp user::rw- group::rw- other::r-- # file: test2.txt # owner: bozo # group: bozgrp user::rw- group::rw- other::r-- bash$ setfacl -m u:bozo:rw yearly_budget.csv bash$ getfacl yearly_budget.csv # file: yearly_budget.csv # owner: accountant # group: budgetgrp user::rw- user:bozo:rw- user:accountant:rw- group::rw- mask::rw- other::r-- readlink Disclose the file that a symbolic link points to. bash$ readlink /usr/bin/awk ../../bin/gawk strings Use the strings command to find printable strings in a binary or data file. It will list sequences of printable characters found in the target file. This might be handy for a quick 'n dirty examination of a core dump or for looking at an unknown graphic image file (strings image-file | more might show something like JFIF, which would identify the file as a jpeg graphic). In a script, you would probably parse the output of strings with grep or sed. See Example 11-8 and Example 11-10. Example 16-34. An &quot;improved&quot; strings command #!/bin/bash # wstrings.sh: &quot;word-strings&quot; (enhanced &quot;strings&quot; command) # # This script filters the output of &quot;strings&quot; by checking it #+ against a standard word list file. # This effectively eliminates gibberish and noise, #+ and outputs only recognized words. # =========================================================== # Standard Check for Script Argument(s) ARGS=1 E_BADARGS=85 E_NOFILE=86 if [ $# -ne $ARGS ] then echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` filename&quot; exit $E_BADARGS fi if [ ! -f &quot;$1&quot; ] # Check if file exists. then echo &quot;File \&quot;$1\&quot; does not exist.&quot; exit $E_NOFILE fi # =========================================================== MINSTRLEN=3 # Minimum string length.

Comparison diff, patch diff: flexible file comparison utility. It compares the target files line-by-line sequentially. In some applications, such as comparing word dictionaries, it may be helpful to filter the files through sort and uniq before piping them to diff. diff file-1 file-2 outputs the lines in the files that differ, with carets showing which file each particular line belongs to. The --side-by-side option to diff outputs each compared file, line by line, in separate columns, with non-matching lines marked. The -c and -u options likewise make the output of the command easier to interpret. There are available various fancy frontends for diff, such as sdiff, wdiff, xdiff, and mgdiff. Tip The diff command returns an exit status of 0 if the compared files are identical, and 1 if they differ (or 2 when binary files are being compared). This permits use of diff in a test construct within a shell script (see below). A common use for diff is generating difference files to be used with patch The -e option outputs files suitable for ed or ex scripts. patch: flexible versioning utility. Given a difference file generated by diff, patch can upgrade a previous version of a package to a newer version. It is much more convenient to distribute a relatively small &quot;diff&quot; file than the entire body of a newly revised package. Kernel &quot;patches&quot; have become the preferred method of distributing the frequent releases of the Linux kernel. patch -p1 &lt;patch-file # Takes all the changes listed in 'patch-file' # and applies them to the files referenced therein. # This upgrades to a newer version of the package. Patching the kernel: cd /usr/src gzip -cd patchXX.gz | patch -p0 # Upgrading kernel source using 'patch'. # From the Linux kernel docs &quot;README&quot;, # by anonymous author (Alan Cox?). Note The diff command can also recursively compare directories (for the filenames present). bash$ diff -r ~/notes1 ~/notes2 Only in /home/bozo/notes1: file02 Only in /home/bozo/notes1: file03 Only in /home/bozo/notes2: file04 Tip Use zdiff to compare gzipped files. Tip Use diffstat to create a histogram (point-distribution graph) of output from diff. diff3, merge An extended version of diff that compares three files at a time. This command returns an exit value of 0 upon successful execution, but unfortunately this gives no information about the results of the comparison. bash$ diff3 file-1 file-2 file-3 ==== 1:1c This is line 1 of &quot;file-1&quot;. 2:1c This is line 1 of &quot;file-2&quot;. 3:1c This is line 1 of &quot;file-3&quot; The merge (3-way file merge) command is an interesting adjunct to diff3. Its syntax is merge Mergefile file1 file2. The result is to output to Mergefile the changes that lead from file1 to file2. Consider this command a stripped-down version of patch. sdiff Compare and/or edit two files in order to merge them into an output file. Because of its interactive nature, this command would find little use in a script. cmp The cmp command is a simpler version of diff, above. Whereas diff reports the differences between two files, cmp merely shows at what point they differ. Note Like diff, cmp returns an exit status of 0 if the compared files are identical, and 1 if they differ. This permits use in a test construct within a shell script. Example 16-35. Using cmp to compare two files within a script. #!/bin/bash # file-comparison.sh ARGS=2 # Two args to script expected. E_BADARGS=85 E_UNREADABLE=86 if [ $# -ne &quot;$ARGS&quot; ] then echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` file1 file2&quot; exit $E_BADARGS fi if [[ ! -r &quot;$1&quot; || ! -r &quot;$2&quot; ]] then echo &quot;Both files to be compared must exist and be readable.&quot; exit $E_UNREADABLE fi cmp $1 $2 &amp;&gt; /dev/null # Redirection to /dev/null buries the output of the &quot;cmp&quot; command. # cmp -s $1 $2 has same result (&quot;-s&quot; silent flag to &quot;cmp&quot;) # Thank you Anders Gustavsson for pointing this out. # # Also works with 'diff', i.e., #+ diff $1 $2 &amp;&gt; /dev/null if [ $? -eq 0 ] # Test exit status of &quot;cmp&quot; command. then echo &quot;File \&quot;$1\&quot; is identical to file \&quot;$2\&quot;.&quot; else echo &quot;File \&quot;$1\&quot; differs from file \&quot;$2\&quot;.&quot; fi exit 0 Tip Use zcmp on gzipped files. comm Versatile file comparison utility. The files must be sorted for this to be useful. comm -options first-file second-file comm file-1 file-2 outputs three columns: column 1 = lines unique to file-1 column 2 = lines unique to file-2 column 3 = lines common to both. The options allow suppressing output of one or more columns. -1 suppresses column 1 -2 suppresses column 2 -3 suppresses column 3 -12 suppresses both columns 1 and 2, etc. This command is useful for comparing &quot;dictionaries&quot; or word lists -- sorted text files with one word per line. Utilities basename Strips the path information from a file name, printing only the file name. The construction basename $0 lets the script know its name, that is, the name it was invoked by. This can be used for &quot;usage&quot; messages if, for example a script is called with missing arguments: echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` arg1 arg2 ... argn&quot; dirname Strips the basename from a filename, printing only the path information. Note basename and dirname can operate on any arbitrary string. The argument does not need to refer to an existing file, or even be a filename for that matter (see Example A-7). Example 16-36. basename and dirname #!/bin/bash address=/home/bozo/daily-journal.txt echo &quot;Basename of /home/bozo/daily-journal.txt = `basename $address`&quot; echo &quot;Dirname of /home/bozo/daily-journal.txt = `dirname $address`&quot; echo echo &quot;My own home is `basename ~/`.&quot; # `basename ~` also works. echo &quot;The home of my home is `dirname ~/`.&quot; # `dirname ~` also works. exit 0 split, csplit These are utilities for splitting a file into smaller chunks. Their usual use is for splitting up large files in order to back them up on floppies or preparatory to e-mailing or uploading them. The csplit command splits a file according to context, the split occuring where patterns are matched. Example 16-37. A script that copies itself in sections #!/bin/bash # splitcopy.sh # A script that splits itself into chunks, #+ then reassembles the chunks into an exact copy #+ of the original script. CHUNKSIZE=4 # Size of first chunk of split files. OUTPREFIX=xx # csplit prefixes, by default, #+ files with &quot;xx&quot; ... csplit &quot;$0&quot; &quot;$CHUNKSIZE&quot; # Some comment lines for padding . . . # Line 15 # Line 16 # Line 17 # Line 18 # Line 19 # Line 20 cat &quot;$OUTPREFIX&quot;* &gt; &quot;$0.copy&quot; # Concatenate the chunks. rm &quot;$OUTPREFIX&quot;* # Get rid of the chunks. exit $? Encoding and Encryption sum, cksum, md5sum, sha1sum These are utilities for generating checksums. A checksum is a number [77] mathematically calculated from the contents of a file, for the purpose of checking its integrity. A script might refer to a list of checksums for security purposes, such as ensuring that the contents of key system files have not been altered or corrupted. For security applications, use the md5sum (message digest 5 checksum) command, or better yet, the newer sha1sum (Secure Hash Algorithm). [78] bash$ cksum /boot/vmlinuz 1670054224 804083 /boot/vmlinuz bash$ echo -n &quot;Top Secret&quot; | cksum 3391003827 10 bash$ md5sum /boot/vmlinuz 0f43eccea8f09e0a0b2b5cf1dcf333ba /boot/vmlinuz bash$ echo -n &quot;Top Secret&quot; | md5sum 8babc97a6f62a4649716f4df8d61728f - Note The cksum command shows the size, in bytes, of its target, whether file or stdout. The md5sum and sha1sum commands display a dash when they receive their input from stdout. Example 16-38.

Also see Example A-19, Example 36-16, and Example 10-2 for creative uses of the md5sum command. Note There have been reports that the 128-bit md5sum can be cracked, so the more secure 160-bit sha1sum is a welcome new addition to the checksum toolkit. bash$ md5sum testfile e181e2c8720c60522c4c4c981108e367 testfile bash$ sha1sum testfile 5d7425a9c08a66c3177f1e31286fa40986ffc996 testfile Security consultants have demonstrated that even sha1sum can be compromised. Fortunately, newer Linux distros include longer bit-length sha224sum, sha256sum, sha384sum, and sha512sum commands. uuencode This utility encodes binary files (images, sound files, compressed files, etc.) into ASCII characters, making them suitable for transmission in the body of an e-mail message or in a newsgroup posting. This is especially useful where MIME (multimedia) encoding is not available. uudecode This reverses the encoding, decoding uuencoded files back into the original binaries. Example 16-39. Uudecoding encoded files #!/bin/bash # Uudecodes all uuencoded files in current working directory. lines=35 # Allow 35 lines for the header (very generous). for File in * # Test all the files in $PWD. do search1=`head -n $lines $File | grep begin | wc -w` search2=`tail -n $lines $File | grep end | wc -w` # Uuencoded files have a &quot;begin&quot; near the beginning, #+ and an &quot;end&quot; near the end. if [ &quot;$search1&quot; -gt 0 ] then if [ &quot;$search2&quot; -gt 0 ] then echo &quot;uudecoding - $File -&quot; uudecode $File fi fi done # Note that running this script upon itself fools it #+ into thinking it is a uuencoded file, #+ because it contains both &quot;begin&quot; and &quot;end&quot;. # Exercise: # -------- # Modify this script to check each file for a newsgroup header, #+ and skip to next if not found. exit 0 Tip The fold -s command may be useful (possibly in a pipe) to process long uudecoded text messages downloaded from Usenet newsgroups. mimencode, mmencode The mimencode and mmencode commands process multimedia-encoded e-mail attachments. Although mail user agents (such as pine or kmail) normally handle this automatically, these particular utilities permit manipulating such attachments manually from the command-line or in batch processing mode by means of a shell script. crypt At one time, this was the standard UNIX file encryption utility. [79] Politically-motivated government regulations prohibiting the export of encryption software resulted in the disappearance of crypt from much of the UNIX world, and it is still missing from most Linux distributions. Fortunately, programmers have come up with a number of decent alternatives to it, among them the author's very own cruft (see Example A-4). openssl This is an Open Source implementation of Secure Sockets Layer encryption. # To encrypt a file: openssl aes-128-ecb -salt -in file.txt -out file.encrypted \ -pass pass:my_password # ^^^^^^^^^^^ User-selected password. # aes-128-ecb is the encryption method chosen. # To decrypt an openssl-encrypted file: openssl aes-128-ecb -d -salt -in file.encrypted -out file.txt \ -pass pass:my_password # ^^^^^^^^^^^ User-selected password. Piping openssl to/from tar makes it possible to encrypt an entire directory tree. # To encrypt a directory: sourcedir=&quot;/home/bozo/testfiles&quot; encrfile=&quot;encr-dir.tar.gz&quot; password=my_secret_password tar czvf - &quot;$sourcedir&quot; | openssl des3 -salt -out &quot;$encrfile&quot; -pass pass:&quot;$password&quot; # ^^^^ Uses des3 encryption. # Writes encrypted file &quot;encr-dir.tar.gz&quot; in current working directory. # To decrypt the resulting tarball: openssl des3 -d -salt -in &quot;$encrfile&quot; -pass pass:&quot;$password&quot; | tar -xzv # Decrypts and unpacks into current working directory. Of course, openssl has many other uses, such as obtaining signed certificates for Web sites. See the info page. shred Securely erase a file by overwriting it multiple times with random bit patterns before deleting it. This command has the same effect as Example 16-61, but does it in a more thorough and elegant manner. This is one of the GNU fileutils. Caution Advanced forensic technology may still be able to recover the contents of a file, even after application of shred. Miscellaneous mktemp Create a temporary file [80] with a &quot;unique&quot; filename. When invoked from the command-line without additional arguments, it creates a zero-length file in the /tmp directory. bash$ mktemp /tmp/tmp.zzsvql3154 PREFIX=filename tempfile=`mktemp $PREFIX.XXXXXX` # ^^^^^^ Need at least 6 placeholders #+ in the filename template. # If no filename template supplied, #+ &quot;tmp.XXXXXXXXXX&quot; is the default. echo &quot;tempfile name = $tempfile&quot; # tempfile name = filename.QA2ZpY # or something similar... # Creates a file of that name in the current working directory #+ with 600 file permissions. # A &quot;umask 177&quot; is therefore unnecessary, #+ but it's good programming practice nevertheless. make Utility for building and compiling binary packages. This can also be used for any set of operations triggered by incremental changes in source files. The make command checks a Makefile, a list of file dependencies and operations to be carried out. The make utility is, in effect, a powerful scripting language similar in many ways to Bash, but with the capability of recognizing dependencies. For in-depth coverage of this useful tool set, see the GNU software documentation site. install Special purpose file copying command, similar to cp, but capable of setting permissions and attributes of the copied files. This command seems tailormade for installing software packages, and as such it shows up frequently in Makefiles (in the make install : section). It could likewise prove useful in installation scripts. dos2unix This utility, written by Benjamin Lin and collaborators, converts DOS-formatted text files (lines terminated by CR-LF) to UNIX format (lines terminated by LF only), and vice-versa. ptx The ptx [targetfile] command outputs a permuted index (cross-reference list) of the targetfile. This may be further filtered and formatted in a pipe, if necessary. more, less Pagers that display a text file or stream to stdout, one screenful at a time. These may be used to filter the output of stdout . . . or of a script. An interesting application of more is to &quot;test drive&quot; a command sequence, to forestall potentially unpleasant consequences. ls /home/bozo | awk '{print &quot;rm -rf &quot; $1}' | more # ^^^^ # Testing the effect of the following (disastrous) command-line: # ls /home/bozo | awk '{print &quot;rm -rf &quot; $1}' | sh # Hand off to the shell to execute . . . ^^ The less pager has the interesting property of doing a formatted display of man page source. See Example A-39. 16.6. Communications Commands Certain of the following commands find use in network data transfer and analysis, as well as in chasing spammers. Information and Statistics host Searches for information about an Internet host by name or IP address, using DNS. bash$ host surfacemail.com surfacemail.com. has address 202.92.42.236 ipcalc Displays IP information for a host. With the -h option, ipcalc does a reverse DNS lookup, finding the name of the host (server) from the IP address. bash$ ipcalc -h 202.92.42.236 HOSTNAME=surfacemail.com nslookup Do an Internet &quot;name server lookup&quot; on a host by IP address. This is essentially equivalent to ipcalc -h or dig -x . The command may be run either interactively or noninteractively, i.e., from within a script. The nslookup command has allegedly been &quot;deprecated,&quot; but it is still useful. bash$ nslookup -sil 66.97.104.180 nslookup kuhleersparnis.ch Server: 135.116.137.2 Address: 135.116.137.2#53 Non-authoritative answer: Name: kuhleersparnis.ch dig Domain Information Groper. Similar to nslookup, dig does an Internet name server lookup on a host. May be run from the command-line or from within a script. Some interesting options to dig are +time=N for setting a query timeout to N seconds, +nofail for continuing to query servers until a reply is received, and -x for doing a reverse address lookup. Compare the output of dig -x with ipcalc -h and nslookup. bash$ dig -x 81.9.6.2 ;; Got answer: ;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NXDOMAIN, id: 11649 ;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 1, ADDITIONAL: 0 ;; QUESTION SECTION: ;2.6.9.81.in-addr.arpa.

The remote host may be specified by an IP address. The output of this command may be filtered by grep or sed in a pipe. bash$ traceroute 81.9.6.2 traceroute to 81.9.6.2 (81.9.6.2), 30 hops max, 38 byte packets 1 tc43.xjbnnbrb.com (136.30.178.8) 191.303 ms 179.400 ms 179.767 ms 2 or0.xjbnnbrb.com (136.30.178.1) 179.536 ms 179.534 ms 169.685 ms 3 192.168.11.101 (192.168.11.101) 189.471 ms 189.556 ms * ... ping Broadcast an ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packet to another machine, either on a local or remote network.

Pity.&quot; fi whois Perform a DNS (Domain Name System) lookup. The -h option permits specifying which particular whois server to query. See Example 4-6 and Example 16-40. finger Retrieve information about users on a network. Optionally, this command can display a user's ~/.plan, ~/.project, and ~/.forward files, if present. bash$ finger Login Name Tty Idle Login Time Office Office Phone bozo Bozo Bozeman tty1 8 Jun 25 16:59 (:0) bozo Bozo Bozeman ttyp0 Jun 25 16:59 (:0.0) bozo Bozo Bozeman ttyp1 Jun 25 17:07 (:0.0) bash$ finger bozo Login: bozo Name: Bozo Bozeman Directory: /home/bozo Shell: /bin/bash Office: 2355 Clown St., 543-1234 On since Fri Aug 31 20:13 (MST) on tty1 1 hour 38 minutes idle On since Fri Aug 31 20:13 (MST) on pts/0 12 seconds idle On since Fri Aug 31 20:13 (MST) on pts/1 On since Fri Aug 31 20:31 (MST) on pts/2 1 hour 16 minutes idle Mail last read Tue Jul 3 10:08 2007 (MST) No Plan. Out of security considerations, many networks disable finger and its associated daemon. [81] chfn Change information disclosed by the finger command. vrfy Verify an Internet e-mail address. This command seems to be missing from newer Linux distros. Remote Host Access sx, rx The sx and rx command set serves to transfer files to and from a remote host using the xmodem protocol. These are generally part of a communications package, such as minicom. sz, rz The sz and rz command set serves to transfer files to and from a remote host using the zmodem protocol. Zmodem has certain advantages over xmodem, such as faster transmission rate and resumption of interrupted file transfers. Like sx and rx, these are generally part of a communications package. ftp Utility and protocol for uploading / downloading files to or from a remote host. An ftp session can be automated in a script (see Example 19-6 and Example A-4). uucp, uux, cu uucp: UNIX to UNIX copy. This is a communications package for transferring files between UNIX servers. A shell script is an effective way to handle a uucp command sequence. Since the advent of the Internet and e-mail, uucp seems to have faded into obscurity, but it still exists and remains perfectly workable in situations where an Internet connection is not available or appropriate. The advantage of uucp is that it is fault-tolerant, so even if there is a service interruption the copy operation will resume where it left off when the connection is restored. --- uux: UNIX to UNIX execute. Execute a command on a remote system. This command is part of the uucp package. --- cu: Call Up a remote system and connect as a simple terminal. It is a sort of dumbed-down version of telnet. This command is part of the uucp package. telnet Utility and protocol for connecting to a remote host. Caution The telnet protocol contains security holes and should therefore probably be avoided. Its use within a shell script is not recommended. wget The wget utility noninteractively retrieves or downloads files from a Web or ftp site. It works well in a script. wget -p http://www.xyz23.com/file01.html # The -p or --page-requisite option causes wget to fetch all files #+ required to display the specified page. wget -r ftp://ftp.xyz24.net/~bozo/project_files/ -O $SAVEFILE # The -r option recursively follows and retrieves all links #+ on the specified site. wget -c ftp://ftp.xyz25.net/bozofiles/filename.tar.bz2 # The -c option lets wget resume an interrupted download. # This works with ftp servers and many HTTP sites. Example 16-42. Getting a stock quote #!/bin/bash # quote-fetch.sh: Download a stock quote. E_NOPARAMS=86 if [ -z &quot;$1&quot; ] # Must specify a stock (symbol) to fetch. then echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` stock-symbol&quot; exit $E_NOPARAMS fi stock_symbol=$1 file_suffix=.html # Fetches an HTML file, so name it appropriately.

See also Example A-30 and Example A-31. lynx The lynx Web and file browser can be used inside a script (with the -dump option) to retrieve a file from a Web or ftp site noninteractively. lynx -dump http://www.xyz23.com/file01.html &gt;$SAVEFILE With the -traversal option, lynx starts at the HTTP URL specified as an argument, then &quot;crawls&quot; through all links located on that particular server. Used together with the -crawl option, outputs page text to a log file. rlogin Remote login, initates a session on a remote host. This command has security issues, so use ssh instead. rsh Remote shell, executes command(s) on a remote host. This has security issues, so use ssh instead. rcp Remote copy, copies files between two different networked machines. rsync Remote synchronize, updates (synchronizes) files between two different networked machines. bash$ rsync -a ~/sourcedir/*txt /node1/subdirectory/ Example 16-43.

Note Using rcp, rsync, and similar utilities with security implications in a shell script may not be advisable. Consider, instead, using ssh, scp, or an expect script. ssh Secure shell, logs onto a remote host and executes commands there. This secure replacement for telnet, rlogin, rcp, and rsh uses identity authentication and encryption. See its manpage for details. Example 16-44. Using ssh #!/bin/bash # remote.bash: Using ssh. # This example by Michael Zick. # Used with permission. # Presumptions: # ------------ # fd-2 isn't being captured ( '2&gt;/dev/null' ). # ssh/sshd presumes stderr ('2') will display to user. # # sshd is running on your machine. # For any 'standard' distribution, it probably is, #+ and without any funky ssh-keygen having been done. # Try ssh to your machine from the command-line: # # $ ssh $HOSTNAME # Without extra set-up you'll be asked for your password. # enter password # when done, $ exit # # Did that work? If so, you're ready for more fun. # Try ssh to your machine as 'root': # # $ ssh -l root $HOSTNAME # When asked for password, enter root's, not yours. # Last login: Tue Aug 10 20:25:49 2004 from localhost.localdomain # Enter 'exit' when done. # The above gives you an interactive shell. # It is possible for sshd to be set up in a 'single command' mode, #+ but that is beyond the scope of this example. # The only thing to note is that the following will work in #+ 'single command' mode. # A basic, write stdout (local) command. ls -l # Now the same basic command on a remote machine. # Pass a different 'USERNAME' 'HOSTNAME' if desired: USER=${USERNAME:-$(whoami)} HOST=${HOSTNAME:-$(hostname)} # Now excute the above command-line on the remote host, #+ with all transmissions encrypted. ssh -l ${USER} ${HOST} &quot; ls -l &quot; # The expected result is a listing of your username's home #+ directory on the remote machine. # To see any difference, run this script from somewhere #+ other than your home directory. # In other words, the Bash command is passed as a quoted line #+ to the remote shell, which executes it on the remote machine. # In this case, sshd does ' bash -c &quot;ls -l&quot; ' on your behalf. # For information on topics such as not having to enter a #+ password/passphrase for every command-line, see #+ man ssh #+ man ssh-keygen #+ man sshd_config. exit 0 Caution Within a loop, ssh may cause unexpected behavior. According to a Usenet post in the comp.unix shell archives, ssh inherits the loop's stdin. To remedy this, pass ssh either the -n or -f option. Thanks, Jason Bechtel, for pointing this out. scp Secure copy, similar in function to rcp, copies files between two different networked machines, but does so using authentication, and with a security level similar to ssh. Local Network write This is a utility for terminal-to-terminal communication. It allows sending lines from your terminal (console or xterm) to that of another user. The mesg command may, of course, be used to disable write access to a terminal Since write is interactive, it would not normally find use in a script. netconfig A command-line utility for configuring a network adapter (using DHCP). This command is native to Red Hat centric Linux distros. Mail mail Send or read e-mail messages. This stripped-down command-line mail client works fine as a command embedded in a script. Example 16-45. A script that mails itself #!/bin/sh # self-mailer.sh: Self-mailing script adr=${1:-`whoami`} # Default to current user, if not specified. # Typing 'self-mailer.sh wiseguy@superdupergenius.com' #+ sends this script to that addressee. # Just 'self-mailer.sh' (no argument) sends the script #+ to the person invoking it, for example, bozo@localhost.localdomain. # # For more on the ${parameter:-default} construct, #+ see the &quot;Parameter Substitution&quot; section #+ of the &quot;Variables Revisited&quot; chapter. # ============================================================================ cat $0 | mail -s &quot;Script \&quot;`basename $0`\&quot; has mailed itself to you.&quot; &quot;$adr&quot; # ============================================================================ # -------------------------------------------- # Greetings from the self-mailing script. # A mischievous person has run this script, #+ which has caused it to mail itself to you. # Apparently, some people have nothing better #+ to do with their time. # -------------------------------------------- echo &quot;At `date`, script \&quot;`basename $0`\&quot; mailed to &quot;$adr&quot;.&quot; exit 0 # Note that the &quot;mailx&quot; command (in &quot;send&quot; mode) may be substituted #+ for &quot;mail&quot; ... but with somewhat different options. mailto Similar to the mail command, mailto sends e-mail messages from the command-line or in a script. However, mailto also permits sending MIME (multimedia) messages. mailstats Show mail statistics. This command may be invoked only by root. root# mailstats Statistics from Tue Jan 1 20:32:08 2008 M msgsfr bytes_from msgsto bytes_to msgsrej msgsdis msgsqur Mailer 4 1682 24118K 0 0K 0 0 0 esmtp 9 212 640K 1894 25131K 0 0 0 local ===================================================================== T 1894 24758K 1894 25131K 0 0 0 C 414 0 vacation This utility automatically replies to e-mails that the intended recipient is on vacation and temporarily unavailable. It runs on a network, in conjunction with sendmail, and is not applicable to a dial-up POPmail account. 16.7. Terminal Control Commands Command affecting the console or terminal tput Initialize terminal and/or fetch information about it from terminfo data. Various options permit certain terminal operations: tput clear is the equivalent of clear; tput reset is the equivalent of reset. bash$ tput longname xterm terminal emulator (X Window System) Issuing a tput cup X Y moves the cursor to the (X,Y) coordinates in the current terminal. A clear to erase the terminal screen would normally precede this. Some interesting options to tput are: bold, for high-intensity text smul, to underline text in the terminal smso, to render text in reverse sgr0, to reset the terminal parameters (to normal), without clearing the screen Example scripts using tput: Example 36-15 Example 36-13 Example A-44 Example A-42 Example 27-2 Note that stty offers a more powerful command set for controlling a terminal. infocmp This command prints out extensive information about the current terminal. It references the terminfo database. bash$ infocmp # Reconstructed via infocmp from file: /usr/share/terminfo/r/rxvt rxvt|rxvt terminal emulator (X Window System), am, bce, eo, km, mir, msgr, xenl, xon, colors#8, cols#80, it#8, lines#24, pairs#64, acsc=``aaffggjjkkllmmnnooppqqrrssttuuvvwwxxyyzz{{||}}~~, bel=^G, blink=\E[5m, bold=\E[1m, civis=\E[?25l, clear=\E[H\E[2J, cnorm=\E[?25h, cr=^M, ... reset Reset terminal parameters and clear text screen. As with clear, the cursor and prompt reappear in the upper lefthand corner of the terminal. clear The clear command simply clears the text screen at the console or in an xterm. The prompt and cursor reappear at the upper lefthand corner of the screen or xterm window. This command may be used either at the command line or in a script. See Example 11-26. resize Echoes commands necessary to set $TERM and $TERMCAP to duplicate the size (dimensions) of the current terminal. bash$ resize set noglob; setenv COLUMNS '80'; setenv LINES '24'; unset noglob; script This utility records (saves to a file) all the user keystrokes at the command-line in a console or an xterm window. This, in effect, creates a record of a session. 16.8. Math Commands &quot;Doing the numbers&quot; factor Decompose an integer into prime factors. bash$ factor 27417 27417: 3 13 19 37 Example 16-46. Generating prime numbers #!/bin/bash # primes2.sh # Generating prime numbers the quick-and-easy way, #+ without resorting to fancy algorithms. CEILING=10000 # 1 to 10000 PRIME=0 E_NOTPRIME= is_prime () { local factors factors=( $(factor $1) ) # Load output of `factor` into array. if [ -z &quot;${factors[2]}&quot; ] # Third element of &quot;factors&quot; array: #+ ${factors[2]} is 2nd factor of argument. # If it is blank, then there is no 2nd factor, #+ and the argument is therefore prime. then return $PRIME # 0 else return $E_NOTPRIME # null fi } echo for n in $(seq $CEILING) do if is_prime $n then printf %5d $n fi # ^ Five positions per number suffices. done # For a higher $CEILING, adjust upward, as necessary. echo exit bc Bash can't handle floating point calculations, and it lacks operators for certain important mathematical functions. Fortunately, bc gallops to the rescue. Not just a versatile, arbitrary precision calculation utility, bc offers many of the facilities of a programming language. It has a syntax vaguely resembling C. Since it is a fairly well-behaved UNIX utility, and may therefore be used in a pipe, bc comes in handy in scripts. Here is a simple template for using bc to calculate a script variable. This uses command substitution. variable=$(echo &quot;OPTIONS; OPERATIONS&quot; | bc) Example 16-47. Monthly Payment on a Mortgage #!/bin/bash # monthlypmt.sh: Calculates monthly payment on a mortgage. # This is a modification of code in the #+ &quot;mcalc&quot; (mortgage calculator) package, #+ by Jeff Schmidt #+ and #+ Mendel Cooper (yours truly, the ABS Guide author). # http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/apps/financial/mcalc-1.6.tar.gz echo echo &quot;Given the principal, interest rate, and term of a mortgage,&quot; echo &quot;calculate the monthly payment.&quot; bottom=1.0 echo echo -n &quot;Enter principal (no commas) &quot; read principal echo -n &quot;Enter interest rate (percent) &quot; # If 12%, enter &quot;12&quot;, not &quot;.12&quot;. read interest_r echo -n &quot;Enter term (months) &quot; read term interest_r=$(echo &quot;scale=9; $interest_r/100.0&quot; | bc) # Convert to decimal. # ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Divide by 100. # &quot;scale&quot; determines how many decimal places. interest_rate=$(echo &quot;scale=9; $interest_r/12 + 1.0&quot; | bc) top=$(echo &quot;scale=9; $principal*$interest_rate^$term&quot; | bc) # ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ # Standard formula for figuring interest. echo; echo &quot;Please be patient.

See also Example A-37. dc The dc (desk calculator) utility is stack-oriented and uses RPN (Reverse Polish Notation). Like bc, it has much of the power of a programming language. Similar to the procedure with bc, echo a command-string to dc. echo &quot;[Printing a string ... ]P&quot; | dc # The P command prints the string between the preceding brackets. # And now for some simple arithmetic. echo &quot;7 8 * p&quot; | dc # 56 # Pushes 7, then 8 onto the stack, #+ multiplies (&quot;*&quot; operator), then prints the result (&quot;p&quot; operator). Most persons avoid dc, because of its non-intuitive input and rather cryptic operators. Yet, it has its uses. Example 16-51. Converting a decimal number to hexadecimal #!/bin/bash # hexconvert.sh: Convert a decimal number to hexadecimal. E_NOARGS=85 # Command-line arg missing.

There seems to be a small, select group of dc wizards who delight in showing off their mastery of this powerful, but arcane utility. bash$ echo &quot;16i[q]sa[ln0=aln100%Pln100/snlbx]sbA0D68736142snlbxq&quot; | dc Bash dc &lt;&lt;&lt; 10k5v1+2/p # 1.6180339887 # ^^^ Feed operations to dc using a Here String. # ^^^ Pushes 10 and sets that as the precision (10k). # ^^ Pushes 5 and takes its square root # (5v, v = square root). # ^^ Pushes 1 and adds it to the running total (1+). # ^^ Pushes 2 and divides the running total by that (2/). # ^ Pops and prints the result (p) # The result is 1.6180339887 ... # ... which happens to be the Pythagorean Golden Ratio, to 10 places.

Miscellaneous Commands Command that fit in no special category jot, seq These utilities emit a sequence of integers, with a user-selectable increment. The default separator character between each integer is a newline, but this can be changed with the -s option. bash$ seq 5 1 2 3 4 5 bash$ seq -s : 5 1:2:3:4:5 Both jot and seq come in handy in a for loop. Example 16-54. Using seq to generate loop arguments #!/bin/bash # Using &quot;seq&quot; echo for a in `seq 80` # or for a in $( seq 80 ) # Same as for a in 1 2 3 4 5 ... 80 (saves much typing!). # May also use 'jot' (if present on system). do echo -n &quot;$a &quot; done # 1 2 3 4 5 ... 80 # Example of using the output of a command to generate # the [list] in a &quot;for&quot; loop. echo; echo COUNT=80 # Yes, 'seq' also accepts a replaceable parameter. for a in `seq $COUNT` # or for a in $( seq $COUNT ) do echo -n &quot;$a &quot; done # 1 2 3 4 5 ... 80 echo; echo BEGIN=75 END=80 for a in `seq $BEGIN $END` # Giving &quot;seq&quot; two arguments starts the count at the first one, #+ and continues until it reaches the second. do echo -n &quot;$a &quot; done # 75 76 77 78 79 80 echo; echo BEGIN=45 INTERVAL=5 END=80 for a in `seq $BEGIN $INTERVAL $END` # Giving &quot;seq&quot; three arguments starts the count at the first one, #+ uses the second for a step interval, #+ and continues until it reaches the third. do echo -n &quot;$a &quot; done # 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 echo; echo exit 0 A simpler example: # Create a set of 10 files, #+ named file.1, file.2 . . . file.10.

E_BADARGS=65 FILE=$1 let LETTERS=$#-1 # How many letters specified (as command-line args). # (Subtract 1 from number of command-line args.) show_help(){ echo echo Usage: `basename $0` file letters echo Note: `basename $0` arguments are case sensitive. echo Example: `basename $0` foobar.txt G n U L i N U x. echo } # Checks number of arguments. if [ $# -lt $MINARGS ]; then echo echo &quot;Not enough arguments.&quot; echo show_help exit $E_BADARGS fi # Checks if file exists. if [ ! -f $FILE ]; then echo &quot;File \&quot;$FILE\&quot; does not exist.&quot; exit $E_BADARGS fi # Counts letter occurrences . for n in `seq $LETTERS`; do shift if [[ `echo -n &quot;$1&quot; | wc -c` -eq 1 ]]; then # Checks arg. echo &quot;$1&quot; -\&gt; `cat $FILE | tr -cd &quot;$1&quot; | wc -c` # Counting. else echo &quot;$1 is not a single char.&quot; fi done exit $? # This script has exactly the same functionality as letter-count2.sh, #+ but executes faster. # Why? Note Somewhat more capable than seq, jot is a classic UNIX utility that is not normally included in a standard Linux distro. However, the source rpm is available for download from the MIT repository. Unlike seq, jot can generate a sequence of random numbers, using the -r option. bash$ jot -r 3 999 1069 1272 1428 getopt The getopt command parses command-line options preceded by a dash. This external command corresponds to the getopts Bash builtin. Using getopt permits handling long options by means of the -l flag, and this also allows parameter reshuffling. Example 16-56. Using getopt to parse command-line options #!/bin/bash # Using getopt # Try the following when invoking this script: # sh ex33a.sh -a # sh ex33a.sh -abc # sh ex33a.sh -a -b -c # sh ex33a.sh -d # sh ex33a.sh -dXYZ # sh ex33a.sh -d XYZ # sh ex33a.sh -abcd # sh ex33a.sh -abcdZ # sh ex33a.sh -z # sh ex33a.sh a # Explain the results of each of the above. E_OPTERR=65 if [ &quot;$#&quot; -eq 0 ] then # Script needs at least one command-line argument. echo &quot;Usage $0 -[options a,b,c]&quot; exit $E_OPTERR fi set -- `getopt &quot;abcd:&quot; &quot;$@&quot;` # Sets positional parameters to command-line arguments. # What happens if you use &quot;$*&quot; instead of &quot;$@&quot;? while [ ! -z &quot;$1&quot; ] do case &quot;$1&quot; in -a) echo &quot;Option \&quot;a\&quot;&quot;;; -b) echo &quot;Option \&quot;b\&quot;&quot;;; -c) echo &quot;Option \&quot;c\&quot;&quot;;; -d) echo &quot;Option \&quot;d\&quot; $2&quot;;; *) break;; esac shift done # It is usually better to use the 'getopts' builtin in a script. # See &quot;ex33.sh.&quot; exit 0 Note As Peggy Russell points out: It is often necessary to include an eval to correctly process whitespace and quotes. args=$(getopt -o a:bc:d -- &quot;$@&quot;) eval set -- &quot;$args&quot; See Example 10-5 for a simplified emulation of getopt. run-parts The run-parts command [82] executes all the scripts in a target directory, sequentially in ASCII-sorted filename order. Of course, the scripts need to have execute permission. The cron daemon invokes run-parts to run the scripts in the /etc/cron.* directories. yes In its default behavior the yes command feeds a continuous string of the character y followed by a line feed to stdout. A control-C terminates the run. A different output string may be specified, as in yes different string, which would continually output different string to stdout. One might well ask the purpose of this. From the command-line or in a script, the output of yes can be redirected or piped into a program expecting user input. In effect, this becomes a sort of poor man's version of expect. yes | fsck /dev/hda1 runs fsck non-interactively (careful!). yes | rm -r dirname has same effect as rm -rf dirname (careful!). Warning Caution advised when piping yes to a potentially dangerous system command, such as fsck or fdisk. It might have unintended consequences. Note The yes command parses variables, or more accurately, it echoes parsed variables. For example: bash$ yes $BASH_VERSION 3.1.17(1)-release 3.1.17(1)-release 3.1.17(1)-release 3.1.17(1)-release 3.1.17(1)-release . . . This particular &quot;feature&quot; may be used to create a very large ASCII file on the fly: bash$ yes $PATH &gt; huge_file.txt Ctl-C Hit Ctl-C very quickly, or you just might get more than you bargained for. . . . The yes command may be emulated in a very simple script function. yes () { # Trivial emulation of &quot;yes&quot; ... local DEFAULT_TEXT=&quot;y&quot; while [ true ] # Endless loop. do if [ -z &quot;$1&quot; ] then echo &quot;$DEFAULT_TEXT&quot; else # If argument ... echo &quot;$1&quot; # ... expand and echo it. fi done # The only things missing are the } #+ --help and --version options. banner Prints arguments as a large vertical banner to stdout, using an ASCII character (default '#'). This may be redirected to a printer for hardcopy. Note that banner has been dropped from many Linux distros, presumably because it is no longer considered useful. printenv Show all the environmental variables set for a particular user. bash$ printenv | grep HOME HOME=/home/bozo lp The lp and lpr commands send file(s) to the print queue, to be printed as hard copy. [83] These commands trace the origin of their names to the line printers of another era. [84] bash$ lp file1.txt or bash lp &lt;file1.txt It is often useful to pipe the formatted output from pr to lp. bash$ pr -options file1.txt | lp Formatting packages, such as groff and Ghostscript may send their output directly to lp. bash$ groff -Tascii file.tr | lp bash$ gs -options | lp file.ps Related commands are lpq, for viewing the print queue, and lprm, for removing jobs from the print queue. tee [UNIX borrows an idea from the plumbing trade.] This is a redirection operator, but with a difference. Like the plumber's tee, it permits &quot;siphoning off&quot; to a file the output of a command or commands within a pipe, but without affecting the result. This is useful for printing an ongoing process to a file or paper, perhaps to keep track of it for debugging purposes. (redirection) |----&gt; to file | ==========================|==================== command ---&gt; command ---&gt; |tee ---&gt; command ---&gt; ---&gt; output of pipe =============================================== cat listfile* | sort | tee check.file | uniq &gt; result.file # ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^ # The file &quot;check.file&quot; contains the concatenated sorted &quot;listfiles,&quot; #+ before the duplicate lines are removed by 'uniq.' mkfifo This obscure command creates a named pipe, a temporary first-in-first-out buffer for transferring data between processes. [85] Typically, one process writes to the FIFO, and the other reads from it. See Example A-14. #!/bin/bash # This short script by Omair Eshkenazi. # Used in ABS Guide with permission (thanks!). mkfifo pipe1 # Yes, pipes can be given names. mkfifo pipe2 # Hence the designation &quot;named pipe.&quot; (cut -d' ' -f1 | tr &quot;a-z&quot; &quot;A-Z&quot;) &gt;pipe2 &lt;pipe1 &amp; ls -l | tr -s ' ' | cut -d' ' -f3,9- | tee pipe1 | cut -d' ' -f2 | paste - pipe2 rm -f pipe1 rm -f pipe2 # No need to kill background processes when script terminates (why not?). exit $? Now, invoke the script and explain the output: sh mkfifo-example.sh 4830.tar.gz BOZO pipe1 BOZO pipe2 BOZO mkfifo-example.sh BOZO Mixed.msg BOZO pathchk This command checks the validity of a filename. If the filename exceeds the maximum allowable length (255 characters) or one or more of the directories in its path is not searchable, then an error message results. Unfortunately, pathchk does not return a recognizable error code, and it is therefore pretty much useless in a script. Consider instead the file test operators. dd Though this somewhat obscure and much feared data duplicator command originated as a utility for exchanging data on magnetic tapes between UNIX minicomputers and IBM mainframes, it still has its uses. The dd command simply copies a file (or stdin/stdout), but with conversions. Possible conversions include ASCII/EBCDIC, [86] upper/lower case, swapping of byte pairs between input and output, and skipping and/or truncating the head or tail of the input file. # Converting a file to all uppercase: dd if=$filename conv=ucase &gt; $filename.uppercase # lcase # For lower case conversion Some basic options to dd are: if=INFILE INFILE is the source file. of=OUTFILE OUTFILE is the target file, the file that will have the data written to it. bs=BLOCKSIZE This is the size of each block of data being read and written, usually a power of 2. skip=BLOCKS How many blocks of data to skip in INFILE before starting to copy. This is useful when the INFILE has &quot;garbage&quot; or garbled data in its header or when it is desirable to copy only a portion of the INFILE. seek=BLOCKS How many blocks of data to skip in OUTFILE before starting to copy, leaving blank data at beginning of OUTFILE. count=BLOCKS Copy only this many blocks of data, rather than the entire INFILE. conv=CONVERSION Type of conversion to be applied to INFILE data before copying operation. A dd --help lists all the options this powerful utility takes. Example 16-57. A script that copies itself #!/bin/bash # self-copy.sh # This script copies itself. file_subscript=copy dd if=$0 of=$0.$file_subscript 2&gt;/dev/null # Suppress messages from dd: ^^^^^^^^^^^ exit $? # A program whose only output is its own source code #+ is called a &quot;quine&quot; per Willard Quine. # Does this script qualify as a quine? Example 16-58. Exercising dd #!/bin/bash # exercising-dd.sh # Script by Stephane Chazelas. # Somewhat modified by ABS Guide author. infile=$0 # This script. outfile=log.txt # Output file left behind. n=8 p=11 dd if=$infile of=$outfile bs=1 skip=$((n-1)) count=$((p-n+1)) 2&gt; /dev/null # Extracts characters n to p (8 to 11) from this script (&quot;bash&quot;). # ---------------------------------------------------------------- echo -n &quot;hello vertical world&quot; | dd cbs=1 conv=unblock 2&gt; /dev/null # Echoes &quot;hello vertical world&quot; vertically downward. # Why? A newline follows each character dd emits. exit $? To demonstrate just how versatile dd is, let's use it to capture keystrokes. Example 16-59. Capturing Keystrokes #!/bin/bash # dd-keypress.sh: Capture keystrokes without needing to press ENTER. keypresses=4 # Number of keypresses to capture. old_tty_setting=$(stty -g) # Save old terminal settings. echo &quot;Press $keypresses keys.&quot; stty -icanon -echo # Disable canonical mode. # Disable local echo. keys=$(dd bs=1 count=$keypresses 2&gt; /dev/null) # 'dd' uses stdin, if &quot;if&quot; (input file) not specified. stty &quot;$old_tty_setting&quot; # Restore old terminal settings. echo &quot;You pressed the \&quot;$keys\&quot; keys.&quot; # Thanks, Stephane Chazelas, for showing the way. exit 0 The dd command can do random access on a data stream. echo -n . | dd bs=1 seek=4 of=file conv=notrunc # The &quot;conv=notrunc&quot; option means that the output file #+ will not be truncated. # Thanks, S.C. The dd command can copy raw data and disk images to and from devices, such as floppies and tape drives (Example A-5). A common use is creating boot floppies. dd if=kernel-image of=/dev/fd0H1440 Similarly, dd can copy the entire contents of a floppy, even one formatted with a &quot;foreign&quot; OS, to the hard drive as an image file. dd if=/dev/fd0 of=/home/bozo/projects/floppy.img Likewise, dd can create bootable flash drives and SD cards. dd if=image.iso of=/dev/sdb Example 16-60. Preparing a bootable SD card for the Raspberry Pi #!/bin/bash # rp.sdcard.sh # Preparing an SD card with a bootable image for the Raspberry Pi. # $1 = imagefile name # $2 = sdcard (device file) # Otherwise defaults to the defaults, see below. DEFAULTbs=4M # Block size, 4 mb default. DEFAULTif=&quot;2013-07-26-wheezy-raspbian.img&quot; # Commonly used distro. DEFAULTsdcard=&quot;/dev/mmcblk0&quot; # May be different. Check! ROOTUSER_NAME=root # Must run as root! E_NOTROOT=81 E_NOIMAGE=82 username=$(id -nu) # Who is running this script? if [ &quot;$username&quot; != &quot;$ROOTUSER_NAME&quot; ] then echo &quot;This script must run as root or with root privileges.&quot; exit $E_NOTROOT fi if [ -n &quot;$1&quot; ] then imagefile=&quot;$1&quot; else imagefile=&quot;$DEFAULTif&quot; fi if [ -n &quot;$2&quot; ] then sdcard=&quot;$2&quot; else sdcard=&quot;$DEFAULTsdcard&quot; fi if [ ! -e $imagefile ] then echo &quot;Image file \&quot;$imagefile\&quot; not found!&quot; exit $E_NOIMAGE fi echo &quot;Last chance to change your mind!&quot;; echo read -s -n1 -p &quot;Hit a key to write $imagefile to $sdcard [Ctl-c to exit].&quot; echo; echo echo &quot;Writing $imagefile to $sdcard ...&quot; dd bs=$DEFAULTbs if=$imagefile of=$sdcard exit $? # Exercises: # --------- # 1) Provide additional error checking. # 2) Have script autodetect device file for SD card (difficult!). # 3) Have script sutodetect image file (*img) in $PWD. Other applications of dd include initializing temporary swap files (Example 31-2) and ramdisks (Example 31-3). It can even do a low-level copy of an entire hard drive partition, although this is not necessarily recommended. People (with presumably nothing better to do with their time) are constantly thinking of interesting applications of dd. Example 16-61. Securely deleting a file #!/bin/bash # blot-out.sh: Erase &quot;all&quot; traces of a file. # This script overwrites a target file alternately #+ with random bytes, then zeros before finally deleting it. # After that, even examining the raw disk sectors by conventional methods #+ will not reveal the original file data. PASSES=7 # Number of file-shredding passes. # Increasing this slows script execution, #+ especially on large target files. BLOCKSIZE=1 # I/O with /dev/urandom requires unit block size, #+ otherwise you get weird results. E_BADARGS=70 # Various error exit codes. E_NOT_FOUND=71 E_CHANGED_MIND=72 if [ -z &quot;$1&quot; ] # No filename specified. then echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` filename&quot; exit $E_BADARGS fi file=$1 if [ ! -e &quot;$file&quot; ] then echo &quot;File \&quot;$file\&quot; not found.&quot; exit $E_NOT_FOUND fi echo; echo -n &quot;Are you absolutely sure you want to blot out \&quot;$file\&quot; (y/n)? &quot; read answer case &quot;$answer&quot; in [nN]) echo &quot;Changed your mind, huh?&quot; exit $E_CHANGED_MIND ;; *) echo &quot;Blotting out file \&quot;$file\&quot;.&quot;;; esac flength=$(ls -l &quot;$file&quot; | awk '{print $5}') # Field 5 is file length. pass_count=1 chmod u+w &quot;$file&quot; # Allow overwriting/deleting the file. echo while [ &quot;$pass_count&quot; -le &quot;$PASSES&quot; ] do echo &quot;Pass #$pass_count&quot; sync # Flush buffers. dd if=/dev/urandom of=$file bs=$BLOCKSIZE count=$flength # Fill with random bytes. sync # Flush buffers again. dd if=/dev/zero of=$file bs=$BLOCKSIZE count=$flength # Fill with zeros. sync # Flush buffers yet again. let &quot;pass_count += 1&quot; echo done rm -f $file # Finally, delete scrambled and shredded file. sync # Flush buffers a final time. echo &quot;File \&quot;$file\&quot; blotted out and deleted.&quot;; echo exit 0 # This is a fairly secure, if inefficient and slow method #+ of thoroughly &quot;shredding&quot; a file. # The &quot;shred&quot; command, part of the GNU &quot;fileutils&quot; package, #+ does the same thing, although more efficiently. # The file cannot not be &quot;undeleted&quot; or retrieved by normal methods. # However . . . #+ this simple method would *not* likely withstand #+ sophisticated forensic analysis. # This script may not play well with a journaled file system. # Exercise (difficult): Fix it so it does. # Tom Vier's &quot;wipe&quot; file-deletion package does a much more thorough job #+ of file shredding than this simple script. # http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/utils/file/wipe-2.0.0.tar.bz2 # For an in-depth analysis on the topic of file deletion and security, #+ see Peter Gutmann's paper, #+ &quot;Secure Deletion of Data From Magnetic and Solid-State Memory&quot;. # http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/secure_del.html See also the dd thread entry in the bibliography. od The od, or octal dump filter converts input (or files) to octal (base-8) or other bases. This is useful for viewing or processing binary data files or otherwise unreadable system device files, such as /dev/urandom, and as a filter for binary data. head -c4 /dev/urandom | od -N4 -tu4 | sed -ne '1s/.* //p' # Sample output: 1324725719, 3918166450, 2989231420, etc. # From rnd.sh example script, by Stéphane Chazelas See also Example 9-16 and Example A-36. hexdump Performs a hexadecimal, octal, decimal, or ASCII dump of a binary file. This command is the rough equivalent of od, above, but not nearly as useful. May be used to view the contents of a binary file, in combination with dd and less. dd if=/bin/ls | hexdump -C | less # The -C option nicely formats the output in tabular form. objdump Displays information about an object file or binary executable in either hexadecimal form or as a disassembled listing (with the -d option). bash$ objdump -d /bin/ls /bin/ls: file format elf32-i386 Disassembly of section .init: 080490bc &lt;.init&gt;: 80490bc: 55 push %ebp 80490bd: 89 e5 mov %esp,%ebp . . . mcookie This command generates a &quot;magic cookie,&quot; a 128-bit (32-character) pseudorandom hexadecimal number, normally used as an authorization &quot;signature&quot; by the X server. This also available for use in a script as a &quot;quick 'n dirty&quot; random number. random000=$(mcookie) Of course, a script could use md5sum for the same purpose. # Generate md5 checksum on the script itself. random001=`md5sum $0 | awk '{print $1}'` # Uses 'awk' to strip off the filename. The mcookie command gives yet another way to generate a &quot;unique&quot; filename. Example 16-62. Filename generator #!/bin/bash # tempfile-name.sh: temp filename generator BASE_STR=`mcookie` # 32-character magic cookie. POS=11 # Arbitrary position in magic cookie string. LEN=5 # Get $LEN consecutive characters. prefix=temp # This is, after all, a &quot;temp&quot; file. # For more &quot;uniqueness,&quot; generate the #+ filename prefix using the same method #+ as the suffix, below. suffix=${BASE_STR:POS:LEN} # Extract a 5-character string, #+ starting at position 11. temp_filename=$prefix.$suffix # Construct the filename. echo &quot;Temp filename = &quot;$temp_filename&quot;&quot; # sh tempfile-name.sh # Temp filename = temp.e19ea # Compare this method of generating &quot;unique&quot; filenames #+ with the 'date' method in ex51.sh. exit 0 units This utility converts between different units of measure. While normally invoked in interactive mode, units may find use in a script. Example 16-63. Converting meters to miles #!/bin/bash # unit-conversion.sh # Must have 'units' utility installed. convert_units () # Takes as arguments the units to convert. { cf=$(units &quot;$1&quot; &quot;$2&quot; | sed --silent -e '1p' | awk '{print $2}') # Strip off everything except the actual conversion factor. echo &quot;$cf&quot; } Unit1=miles Unit2=meters cfactor=`convert_units $Unit1 $Unit2` quantity=3.73 result=$(echo $quantity*$cfactor | bc) echo &quot;There are $result $Unit2 in $quantity $Unit1.&quot; # What happens if you pass incompatible units, #+ such as &quot;acres&quot; and &quot;miles&quot; to the function? exit 0 # Exercise: Edit this script to accept command-line parameters, # with appropriate error checking, of course. m4 A hidden treasure, m4 is a powerful macro [87] processing filter, virtually a complete language. Although originally written as a pre-processor for RatFor, m4 turned out to be useful as a stand-alone utility. In fact, m4 combines some of the functionality of eval, tr, and awk, in addition to its extensive macro expansion facilities. The April, 2002 issue of Linux Journal has a very nice article on m4 and its uses. Example 16-64. Using m4 #!/bin/bash # m4.sh: Using the m4 macro processor # Strings string=abcdA01 echo &quot;len($string)&quot; | m4 # 7 echo &quot;substr($string,4)&quot; | m4 # A01 echo &quot;regexp($string,[0-1][0-1],\&amp;Z)&quot; | m4 # 01Z # Arithmetic var=99 echo &quot;incr($var)&quot; | m4 # 100 echo &quot;eval($var / 3)&quot; | m4 # 33 exit xmessage This X-based variant of echo pops up a message/query window on the desktop. xmessage Left click to continue -button okay zenity The zenity utility is adept at displaying GTK+ dialog widgets and very suitable for scripting purposes. doexec The doexec command enables passing an arbitrary list of arguments to a binary executable. In particular, passing argv[0] (which corresponds to $0 in a script) lets the executable be invoked by various names, and it can then carry out different sets of actions, according to the name by which it was called. What this amounts to is roundabout way of passing options to an executable. For example, the /usr/local/bin directory might contain a binary called &quot;aaa&quot;. Invoking doexec /usr/local/bin/aaa list would list all those files in the current working directory beginning with an &quot;a&quot;, while invoking (the same executable with) doexec /usr/local/bin/aaa delete would delete those files. Note The various behaviors of the executable must be defined within the code of the executable itself, analogous to something like the following in a shell script: case `basename $0` in &quot;name1&quot; ) do_something;; &quot;name2&quot; ) do_something_else;; &quot;name3&quot; ) do_yet_another_thing;; * ) bail_out;; esac dialog The dialog family of tools provide a method of calling interactive &quot;dialog&quot; boxes from a script. The more elaborate variations of dialog -- gdialog, Xdialog, and kdialog -- actually invoke X-Windows widgets. sox The sox, or &quot;sound exchange&quot; command plays and performs transformations on sound files. In fact, the /usr/bin/play executable (now deprecated) is nothing but a shell wrapper for sox. For example, sox soundfile.wav soundfile.au changes a WAV sound file into a (Sun audio format) AU sound file. Shell scripts are ideally suited for batch-processing sox operations on sound files. For examples, see the Linux Radio Timeshift HOWTO and the MP3do Project. Chapter 17. System and Administrative Commands The startup and shutdown scripts in /etc/rc.d illustrate the uses (and usefulness) of many of these comands. These are usually invoked by root and used for system maintenance or emergency filesystem repairs. Use with caution, as some of these commands may damage your system if misused. Users and Groups users Show all logged on users. This is the approximate equivalent of who -q. groups Lists the current user and the groups she belongs to. This corresponds to the $GROUPS internal variable, but gives the group names, rather than the numbers. bash$ groups bozita cdrom cdwriter audio xgrp bash$ echo $GROUPS 501 chown, chgrp The chown command changes the ownership of a file or files. This command is a useful method that root can use to shift file ownership from one user to another. An ordinary user may not change the ownership of files, not even her own files. [88] root# chown bozo *.txt The chgrp command changes the group ownership of a file or files. You must be owner of the file(s) as well as a member of the destination group (or root) to use this operation. chgrp --recursive dunderheads *.data # The &quot;dunderheads&quot; group will now own all the &quot;*.data&quot; files #+ all the way down the $PWD directory tree (that's what &quot;recursive&quot; means). useradd, userdel The useradd administrative command adds a user account to the system and creates a home directory for that particular user, if so specified. The corresponding userdel command removes a user account from the system [89] and deletes associated files. Note The adduser command is a synonym for useradd and is usually a symbolic link to it. usermod Modify a user account. Changes may be made to the password, group membership, expiration date, and other attributes of a given user's account. With this command, a user's password may be locked, which has the effect of disabling the account. groupmod Modify a given group. The group name and/or ID number may be changed using this command. id The id command lists the real and effective user IDs and the group IDs of the user associated with the current process. This is the counterpart to the $UID, $EUID, and $GROUPS internal Bash variables. bash$ id uid=501(bozo) gid=501(bozo) groups=501(bozo),22(cdrom),80(cdwriter),81(audio) bash$ echo $UID 501 Note The id command shows the effective IDs only when they differ from the real ones. Also see Example 9-5. lid The lid (list ID) command shows the group(s) that a given user belongs to, or alternately, the users belonging to a given group. May be invoked only by root. root# lid bozo bozo(gid=500) root# lid daemon bin(gid=1) daemon(gid=2) adm(gid=4) lp(gid=7) who Show all users logged on to the system. bash$ who bozo tty1 Apr 27 17:45 bozo pts/0 Apr 27 17:46 bozo pts/1 Apr 27 17:47 bozo pts/2 Apr 27 17:49 The -m gives detailed information about only the current user. Passing any two arguments to who is the equivalent of who -m, as in who am i or who The Man. bash$ who -m localhost.localdomain!bozo pts/2 Apr 27 17:49 whoami is similar to who -m, but only lists the user name. bash$ whoami bozo w Show all logged on users and the processes belonging to them. This is an extended version of who. The output of w may be piped to grep to find a specific user and/or process. bash$ w | grep startx bozo tty1 - 4:22pm 6:41 4.47s 0.45s startx logname Show current user's login name (as found in /var/run/utmp). This is a near-equivalent to whoami, above. bash$ logname bozo bash$ whoami bozo However . . . bash$ su Password: ...... bash# whoami root bash# logname bozo Note While logname prints the name of the logged in user, whoami gives the name of the user attached to the current process. As we have just seen, sometimes these are not the same. su Runs a program or script as a substitute user. su rjones starts a shell as user rjones. A naked su defaults to root. See Example A-14. sudo Runs a command as root (or another user). This may be used in a script, thus permitting a regular user to run the script. #!/bin/bash # Some commands. sudo cp /root/secretfile /home/bozo/secret # Some more commands. The file /etc/sudoers holds the names of users permitted to invoke sudo. passwd Sets, changes, or manages a user's password. The passwd command can be used in a script, but probably should not be. Example 17-1. Setting a new password #!/bin/bash # setnew-password.sh: For demonstration purposes only. # Not a good idea to actually run this script. # This script must be run as root. ROOT_UID=0 # Root has $UID 0. E_WRONG_USER=65 # Not root? E_NOSUCHUSER=70 SUCCESS=0 if [ &quot;$UID&quot; -ne &quot;$ROOT_UID&quot; ] then echo; echo &quot;Only root can run this script.&quot;; echo exit $E_WRONG_USER else echo echo &quot;You should know better than to run this script, root.&quot; echo &quot;Even root users get the blues... &quot; echo fi username=bozo NEWPASSWORD=security_violation # Check if bozo lives here. grep -q &quot;$username&quot; /etc/passwd if [ $? -ne $SUCCESS ] then echo &quot;User $username does not exist.&quot; echo &quot;No password changed.&quot; exit $E_NOSUCHUSER fi echo &quot;$NEWPASSWORD&quot; | passwd --stdin &quot;$username&quot; # The '--stdin' option to 'passwd' permits #+ getting a new password from stdin (or a pipe). echo; echo &quot;User $username's password changed!&quot; # Using the 'passwd' command in a script is dangerous. exit 0 The passwd command's -l, -u, and -d options permit locking, unlocking, and deleting a user's password. Only root may use these options. ac Show users' logged in time, as read from /var/log/wtmp. This is one of the GNU accounting utilities. bash$ ac total 68.08 last List last logged in users, as read from /var/log/wtmp. This command can also show remote logins. For example, to show the last few times the system rebooted: bash$ last reboot reboot system boot 2.6.9-1.667 Fri Feb 4 18:18 (00:02) reboot system boot 2.6.9-1.667 Fri Feb 4 15:20 (01:27) reboot system boot 2.6.9-1.667 Fri Feb 4 12:56 (00:49) reboot system boot 2.6.9-1.667 Thu Feb 3 21:08 (02:17) . . . wtmp begins Tue Feb 1 12:50:09 2005 newgrp Change user's group ID without logging out. This permits access to the new group's files. Since users may be members of multiple groups simultaneously, this command finds only limited use. Note Kurt Glaesemann points out that the newgrp command could prove helpful in setting the default group permissions for files a user writes. However, the chgrp command might be more convenient for this purpose. Terminals tty Echoes the name (filename) of the current user's terminal. Note that each separate xterm window counts as a different terminal. bash$ tty /dev/pts/1 stty Shows and/or changes terminal settings. This complex command, used in a script, can control terminal behavior and the way output displays. See the info page, and study it carefully. Example 17-2. Setting an erase character #!/bin/bash # erase.sh: Using &quot;stty&quot; to set an erase character when reading input. echo -n &quot;What is your name? &quot; read name # Try to backspace #+ to erase characters of input. # Problems? echo &quot;Your name is $name.&quot; stty erase '#' # Set &quot;hashmark&quot; (#) as erase character. echo -n &quot;What is your name? &quot; read name # Use # to erase last character typed. echo &quot;Your name is $name.&quot; exit 0 # Even after the script exits, the new key value remains set. # Exercise: How would you reset the erase character to the default value? Example 17-3. secret password: Turning off terminal echoing #!/bin/bash # secret-pw.sh: secret password echo echo -n &quot;Enter password &quot; read passwd echo &quot;password is $passwd&quot; echo -n &quot;If someone had been looking over your shoulder, &quot; echo &quot;your password would have been compromised.&quot; echo &amp;&amp; echo # Two line-feeds in an &quot;and list.&quot; stty -echo # Turns off screen echo. # May also be done with # read -sp passwd # A big Thank You to Leigh James for pointing this out. echo -n &quot;Enter password again &quot; read passwd echo echo &quot;password is $passwd&quot; echo stty echo # Restores screen echo. exit 0 # Do an 'info stty' for more on this useful-but-tricky command. A creative use of stty is detecting a user keypress (without hitting ENTER). Example 17-4. Keypress detection #!/bin/bash # keypress.sh: Detect a user keypress (&quot;hot keys&quot;). echo old_tty_settings=$(stty -g) # Save old settings (why?). stty -icanon Keypress=$(head -c1) # or $(dd bs=1 count=1 2&gt; /dev/null) # on non-GNU systems echo echo &quot;Key pressed was \&quot;&quot;$Keypress&quot;\&quot;.&quot; echo stty &quot;$old_tty_settings&quot; # Restore old settings. # Thanks, Stephane Chazelas. exit 0 Also see Example 9-3 and Example A-43. terminals and modes Normally, a terminal works in the canonical mode. When a user hits a key, the resulting character does not immediately go to the program actually running in this terminal. A buffer local to the terminal stores keystrokes. When the user hits the ENTER key, this sends all the stored keystrokes to the program running. There is even a basic line editor inside the terminal. bash$ stty -a speed 9600 baud; rows 36; columns 96; line = 0; intr = ^C; quit = ^\; erase = ^H; kill = ^U; eof = ^D; eol = &lt;undef&gt;; eol2 = &lt;undef&gt;; start = ^Q; stop = ^S; susp = ^Z; rprnt = ^R; werase = ^W; lnext = ^V; flush = ^O; ... isig icanon iexten echo echoe echok -echonl -noflsh -xcase -tostop -echoprt Using canonical mode, it is possible to redefine the special keys for the local terminal line editor. bash$ cat &gt; filexxx wha&lt;ctl-W&gt;I&lt;ctl-H&gt;foo bar&lt;ctl-U&gt;hello world&lt;ENTER&gt; &lt;ctl-D&gt; bash$ cat filexxx hello world bash$ wc -c &lt; filexxx 12 The process controlling the terminal receives only 12 characters (11 alphabetic ones, plus a newline), although the user hit 26 keys. In non-canonical (&quot;raw&quot;) mode, every key hit (including special editing keys such as ctl-H) sends a character immediately to the controlling process. The Bash prompt disables both icanon and echo, since it replaces the basic terminal line editor with its own more elaborate one. For example, when you hit ctl-A at the Bash prompt, there's no ^A echoed by the terminal, but Bash gets a \1 character, interprets it, and moves the cursor to the begining of the line. Stéphane Chazelas setterm Set certain terminal attributes. This command writes to its terminal's stdout a string that changes the behavior of that terminal. bash$ setterm -cursor off bash$ The setterm command can be used within a script to change the appearance of text written to stdout, although there are certainly better tools available for this purpose. setterm -bold on echo bold hello setterm -bold off echo normal hello tset Show or initialize terminal settings. This is a less capable version of stty. bash$ tset -r Terminal type is xterm-xfree86. Kill is control-U (^U). Interrupt is control-C (^C). setserial Set or display serial port parameters. This command must be run by root and is usually found in a system setup script. # From /etc/pcmcia/serial script: IRQ=`setserial /dev/$DEVICE | sed -e 's/.*IRQ: //'` setserial /dev/$DEVICE irq 0 ; setserial /dev/$DEVICE irq $IRQ getty, agetty The initialization process for a terminal uses getty or agetty to set it up for login by a user. These commands are not used within user shell scripts. Their scripting counterpart is stty. mesg Enables or disables write access to the current user's terminal. Disabling access would prevent another user on the network to write to the terminal. Tip It can be quite annoying to have a message about ordering pizza suddenly appear in the middle of the text file you are editing. On a multi-user network, you might therefore wish to disable write access to your terminal when you need to avoid interruptions. wall This is an acronym for &quot;write all,&quot; i.e., sending a message to all users at every terminal logged into the network. It is primarily a system administrator's tool, useful, for example, when warning everyone that the system will shortly go down due to a problem (see Example 19-1). bash$ wall System going down for maintenance in 5 minutes! Broadcast message from bozo (pts/1) Sun Jul 8 13:53:27 2001... System going down for maintenance in 5 minutes! Note If write access to a particular terminal has been disabled with mesg, then wall cannot send a message to that terminal. Information and Statistics uname Output system specifications (OS, kernel version, etc.) to stdout. Invoked with the -a option, gives verbose system info (see Example 16-5). The -s option shows only the OS type. bash$ uname Linux bash$ uname -s Linux bash$ uname -a Linux iron.bozo 2.6.15-1.2054_FC5 #1 Tue Mar 14 15:48:33 EST 2006 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux arch Show system architecture. Equivalent to uname -m. See Example 11-27. bash$ arch i686 bash$ uname -m i686 lastcomm Gives information about previous commands, as stored in the /var/account/pacct file. Command name and user name can be specified by options. This is one of the GNU accounting utilities. lastlog List the last login time of all system users. This references the /var/log/lastlog file. bash$ lastlog root tty1 Fri Dec 7 18:43:21 -0700 2001 bin **Never logged in** daemon **Never logged in** ... bozo tty1 Sat Dec 8 21:14:29 -0700 2001 bash$ lastlog | grep root root tty1 Fri Dec 7 18:43:21 -0700 2001 Caution This command will fail if the user invoking it does not have read permission for the /var/log/lastlog file. lsof List open files. This command outputs a detailed table of all currently open files and gives information about their owner, size, the processes associated with them, and more. Of course, lsof may be piped to grep and/or awk to parse and analyze its results. bash$ lsof COMMAND PID USER FD TYPE DEVICE SIZE NODE NAME init 1 root mem REG 3,5 30748 30303 /sbin/init init 1 root mem REG 3,5 73120 8069 /lib/ld-2.1.3.so init 1 root mem REG 3,5 931668 8075 /lib/libc-2.1.3.so cardmgr 213 root mem REG 3,5 36956 30357 /sbin/cardmgr ... The lsof command is a useful, if complex administrative tool. If you are unable to dismount a filesystem and get an error message that it is still in use, then running lsof helps determine which files are still open on that filesystem. The -i option lists open network socket files, and this can help trace intrusion or hack attempts. bash$ lsof -an -i tcp COMMAND PID USER FD TYPE DEVICE SIZE NODE NAME firefox 2330 bozo 32u IPv4 9956 TCP 66.0.118.137:57596-&gt;67.112.7.104:http ... firefox 2330 bozo 38u IPv4 10535 TCP 66.0.118.137:57708-&gt;216.79.48.24:http ... See Example 30-2 for an effective use of lsof. strace System trace: diagnostic and debugging tool for tracing system calls and signals. This command and ltrace, following, are useful for diagnosing why a given program or package fails to run . . . perhaps due to missing libraries or related causes. bash$ strace df execve(&quot;/bin/df&quot;, [&quot;df&quot;], [/* 45 vars */]) = 0 uname({sys=&quot;Linux&quot;, node=&quot;bozo.localdomain&quot;, ...}) = 0 brk(0) = 0x804f5e4 ... This is the Linux equivalent of the Solaris truss command. ltrace Library trace: diagnostic and debugging tool that traces library calls invoked by a given command. bash$ ltrace df __libc_start_main(0x804a910, 1, 0xbfb589a4, 0x804fb70, 0x804fb68 &lt;unfinished ...&gt;: setlocale(6, &quot;&quot;) = &quot;en_US.UTF-8&quot; bindtextdomain(&quot;coreutils&quot;, &quot;/usr/share/locale&quot;) = &quot;/usr/share/locale&quot; textdomain(&quot;coreutils&quot;) = &quot;coreutils&quot; __cxa_atexit(0x804b650, 0, 0, 0x8052bf0, 0xbfb58908) = 0 getenv(&quot;DF_BLOCK_SIZE&quot;) = NULL ... nc The nc (netcat) utility is a complete toolkit for connecting to and listening to TCP and UDP ports. It is useful as a diagnostic and testing tool and as a component in simple script-based HTTP clients and servers. bash$ nc localhost.localdomain 25 220 localhost.localdomain ESMTP Sendmail 8.13.1/8.13.1; Thu, 31 Mar 2005 15:41:35 -0700 A real-life usage example.

And, of course, there's Dr. Andrew Tridgell's notorious one-line script in the BitKeeper Affair: echo clone | nc thunk.org 5000 &gt; e2fsprogs.dat free Shows memory and cache usage in tabular form. The output of this command lends itself to parsing, using grep, awk or Perl. The procinfo command shows all the information that free does, and much more. bash$ free total used free shared buffers cached Mem: 30504 28624 1880 15820 1608 16376 -/+ buffers/cache: 10640 19864 Swap: 68540 3128 65412 To show unused RAM memory: bash$ free | grep Mem | awk '{ print $4 }' 1880 procinfo Extract and list information and statistics from the /proc pseudo-filesystem.

Handy for debugging and ascertaining which device drivers were installed and which system interrupts in use. The output of dmesg may, of course, be parsed with grep, sed, or awk from within a script. bash$ dmesg | grep hda Kernel command line: ro root=/dev/hda2 hda: IBM-DLGA-23080, ATA DISK drive hda: 6015744 sectors (3080 MB) w/96KiB Cache, CHS=746/128/63 hda: hda1 hda2 hda3 &lt; hda5 hda6 hda7 &gt; hda4 stat Gives detailed and verbose statistics on a given file (even a directory or device file) or set of files. bash$ stat test.cru File: &quot;test.cru&quot; Size: 49970 Allocated Blocks: 100 Filetype: Regular File Mode: (0664/-rw-rw-r--) Uid: ( 501/ bozo) Gid: ( 501/ bozo) Device: 3,8 Inode: 18185 Links: 1 Access: Sat Jun 2 16:40:24 2001 Modify: Sat Jun 2 16:40:24 2001 Change: Sat Jun 2 16:40:24 2001 If the target file does not exist, stat returns an error message. bash$ stat nonexistent-file nonexistent-file: No such file or directory In a script, you can use stat to extract information about files (and filesystems) and set variables accordingly. #!/bin/bash # fileinfo2.sh # Per suggestion of Joël Bourquard and . . . # http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?t=410766 FILENAME=testfile.txt file_name=$(stat -c%n &quot;$FILENAME&quot;) # Same as &quot;$FILENAME&quot; of course. file_owner=$(stat -c%U &quot;$FILENAME&quot;) file_size=$(stat -c%s &quot;$FILENAME&quot;) # Certainly easier than using &quot;ls -l $FILENAME&quot; #+ and then parsing with sed. file_inode=$(stat -c%i &quot;$FILENAME&quot;) file_type=$(stat -c%F &quot;$FILENAME&quot;) file_access_rights=$(stat -c%A &quot;$FILENAME&quot;) echo &quot;File name: $file_name&quot; echo &quot;File owner: $file_owner&quot; echo &quot;File size: $file_size&quot; echo &quot;File inode: $file_inode&quot; echo &quot;File type: $file_type&quot; echo &quot;File access rights: $file_access_rights&quot; exit 0 sh fileinfo2.sh File name: testfile.txt File owner: bozo File size: 418 File inode: 1730378 File type: regular file File access rights: -rw-rw-r-- vmstat Display virtual memory statistics. bash$ vmstat procs memory swap io system cpu r b w swpd free buff cache si so bi bo in cs us sy id 0 0 0 0 11040 2636 38952 0 0 33 7 271 88 8 3 89 uptime Shows how long the system has been running, along with associated statistics. bash$ uptime 10:28pm up 1:57, 3 users, load average: 0.17, 0.34, 0.27 Note A load average of 1 or less indicates that the system handles processes immediately. A load average greater than 1 means that processes are being queued. When the load average gets above 3 (on a single-core processor), then system performance is significantly degraded. hostname Lists the system's host name. This command sets the host name in an /etc/rc.d setup script (/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit or similar). It is equivalent to uname -n, and a counterpart to the $HOSTNAME internal variable. bash$ hostname localhost.localdomain bash$ echo $HOSTNAME localhost.localdomain Similar to the hostname command are the domainname, dnsdomainname, nisdomainname, and ypdomainname commands. Use these to display or set the system DNS or NIS/YP domain name. Various options to hostname also perform these functions. hostid Echo a 32-bit hexadecimal numerical identifier for the host machine. bash$ hostid 7f0100 Note This command allegedly fetches a &quot;unique&quot; serial number for a particular system. Certain product registration procedures use this number to brand a particular user license. Unfortunately, hostid only returns the machine network address in hexadecimal, with pairs of bytes transposed. The network address of a typical non-networked Linux machine, is found in /etc/hosts. bash$ cat /etc/hosts 127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost As it happens, transposing the bytes of 127.0.0.1, we get 0.127.1.0, which translates in hex to 007f0100, the exact equivalent of what hostid returns, above. There exist only a few million other Linux machines with this identical hostid. sar Invoking sar (System Activity Reporter) gives a very detailed rundown on system statistics. The Santa Cruz Operation (&quot;Old&quot; SCO) released sar as Open Source in June, 1999. This command is not part of the base Linux distribution, but may be obtained as part of the sysstat utilities package, written by Sebastien Godard. bash$ sar Linux 2.4.9 (brooks.seringas.fr) 09/26/03 10:30:00 CPU %user %nice %system %iowait %idle 10:40:00 all 2.21 10.90 65.48 0.00 21.41 10:50:00 all 3.36 0.00 72.36 0.00 24.28 11:00:00 all 1.12 0.00 80.77 0.00 18.11 Average: all 2.23 3.63 72.87 0.00 21.27 14:32:30 LINUX RESTART 15:00:00 CPU %user %nice %system %iowait %idle 15:10:00 all 8.59 2.40 17.47 0.00 71.54 15:20:00 all 4.07 1.00 11.95 0.00 82.98 15:30:00 all 0.79 2.94 7.56 0.00 88.71 Average: all 6.33 1.70 14.71 0.00 77.26 readelf Show information and statistics about a designated elf binary.

You do not have to be root to invoke logger. logger Experiencing instability in network connection at 23:10, 05/21. # Now, do a 'tail /var/log/messages'. By embedding a logger command in a script, it is possible to write debugging information to /var/log/messages. logger -t $0 -i Logging at line &quot;$LINENO&quot;. # The &quot;-t&quot; option specifies the tag for the logger entry. # The &quot;-i&quot; option records the process ID. # tail /var/log/message # ... # Jul 7 20:48:58 localhost ./test.sh[1712]: Logging at line 3. logrotate This utility manages the system log files, rotating, compressing, deleting, and/or e-mailing them, as appropriate. This keeps the /var/log from getting cluttered with old log files. Usually cron runs logrotate on a daily basis. Adding an appropriate entry to /etc/logrotate.conf makes it possible to manage personal log files, as well as system-wide ones. Note Stefano Falsetto has created rottlog, which he considers to be an improved version of logrotate. Job Control ps Process Statistics: lists currently executing processes by owner and PID (process ID). This is usually invoked with ax or aux options, and may be piped to grep or sed to search for a specific process (see Example 15-14 and Example 29-3). bash$ ps ax | grep sendmail 295 ? S 0:00 sendmail: accepting connections on port 25 To display system processes in graphical &quot;tree&quot; format: ps afjx or ps ax --forest. pgrep, pkill Combining the ps command with grep or kill. bash$ ps a | grep mingetty 2212 tty2 Ss+ 0:00 /sbin/mingetty tty2 2213 tty3 Ss+ 0:00 /sbin/mingetty tty3 2214 tty4 Ss+ 0:00 /sbin/mingetty tty4 2215 tty5 Ss+ 0:00 /sbin/mingetty tty5 2216 tty6 Ss+ 0:00 /sbin/mingetty tty6 4849 pts/2 S+ 0:00 grep mingetty bash$ pgrep mingetty 2212 mingetty 2213 mingetty 2214 mingetty 2215 mingetty 2216 mingetty Compare the action of pkill with killall. pstree Lists currently executing processes in &quot;tree&quot; format. The -p option shows the PIDs, as well as the process names. top Continuously updated display of most cpu-intensive processes. The -b option displays in text mode, so that the output may be parsed or accessed from a script. bash$ top -b 8:30pm up 3 min, 3 users, load average: 0.49, 0.32, 0.13 45 processes: 44 sleeping, 1 running, 0 zombie, 0 stopped CPU states: 13.6% user, 7.3% system, 0.0% nice, 78.9% idle Mem: 78396K av, 65468K used, 12928K free, 0K shrd, 2352K buff Swap: 157208K av, 0K used, 157208K free 37244K cached PID USER PRI NI SIZE RSS SHARE STAT %CPU %MEM TIME COMMAND 848 bozo 17 0 996 996 800 R 5.6 1.2 0:00 top 1 root 8 0 512 512 444 S 0.0 0.6 0:04 init 2 root 9 0 0 0 0 SW 0.0 0.0 0:00 keventd ... nice Run a background job with an altered priority. Priorities run from 19 (lowest) to -20 (highest). Only root may set the negative (higher) priorities. Related commands are renice and snice, which change the priority of a running process or processes, and skill, which sends a kill signal to a process or processes. nohup Keeps a command running even after user logs off. The command will run as a foreground process unless followed by &amp;. If you use nohup within a script, consider coupling it with a wait to avoid creating an orphan or zombie process. pidof Identifies process ID (PID) of a running job. Since job control commands, such as kill and renice act on the PID of a process (not its name), it is sometimes necessary to identify that PID. The pidof command is the approximate counterpart to the $PPID internal variable. bash$ pidof xclock 880 Example 17-6. pidof helps kill a process #!/bin/bash # kill-process.sh NOPROCESS=2 process=xxxyyyzzz # Use nonexistent process. # For demo purposes only... # ... don't want to actually kill any actual process with this script. # # If, for example, you wanted to use this script to logoff the Internet, # process=pppd t=`pidof $process` # Find pid (process id) of $process. # The pid is needed by 'kill' (can't 'kill' by program name). if [ -z &quot;$t&quot; ] # If process not present, 'pidof' returns null. then echo &quot;Process $process was not running.&quot; echo &quot;Nothing killed.&quot; exit $NOPROCESS fi kill $t # May need 'kill -9' for stubborn process. # Need a check here to see if process allowed itself to be killed. # Perhaps another &quot; t=`pidof $process` &quot; or ... # This entire script could be replaced by # kill $(pidof -x process_name) # or # killall process_name # but it would not be as instructive. exit 0 fuser Identifies the processes (by PID) that are accessing a given file, set of files, or directory. May also be invoked with the -k option, which kills those processes. This has interesting implications for system security, especially in scripts preventing unauthorized users from accessing system services. bash$ fuser -u /usr/bin/vim /usr/bin/vim: 3207e(bozo) bash$ fuser -u /dev/null /dev/null: 3009(bozo) 3010(bozo) 3197(bozo) 3199(bozo) One important application for fuser is when physically inserting or removing storage media, such as CD ROM disks or USB flash drives. Sometimes trying a umount fails with a device is busy error message. This means that some user(s) and/or process(es) are accessing the device. An fuser -um /dev/device_name will clear up the mystery, so you can kill any relevant processes. bash$ umount /mnt/usbdrive umount: /mnt/usbdrive: device is busy bash$ fuser -um /dev/usbdrive /mnt/usbdrive: 1772c(bozo) bash$ kill -9 1772 bash$ umount /mnt/usbdrive The fuser command, invoked with the -n option identifies the processes accessing a port. This is especially useful in combination with nmap. root# nmap localhost.localdomain PORT STATE SERVICE 25/tcp open smtp root# fuser -un tcp 25 25/tcp: 2095(root) root# ps ax | grep 2095 | grep -v grep 2095 ? Ss 0:00 sendmail: accepting connections cron Administrative program scheduler, performing such duties as cleaning up and deleting system log files and updating the slocate database. This is the superuser version of at (although each user may have their own crontab file which can be changed with the crontab command). It runs as a daemon and executes scheduled entries from /etc/crontab. Note Some flavors of Linux run crond, Matthew Dillon's version of cron. Process Control and Booting init The init command is the parent of all processes. Called in the final step of a bootup, init determines the runlevel of the system from /etc/inittab. Invoked by its alias telinit, and by root only. telinit Symlinked to init, this is a means of changing the system runlevel, usually done for system maintenance or emergency filesystem repairs. Invoked only by root. This command can be dangerous -- be certain you understand it well before using! runlevel Shows the current and last runlevel, that is, whether the system is halted (runlevel 0), in single-user mode (1), in multi-user mode (2 or 3), in X Windows (5), or rebooting (6). This command accesses the /var/run/utmp file. halt, shutdown, reboot Command set to shut the system down, usually just prior to a power down. Warning On some Linux distros, the halt command has 755 permissions, so it can be invoked by a non-root user. A careless halt in a terminal or a script may shut down the system! service Starts or stops a system service. The startup scripts in /etc/init.d and /etc/rc.d use this command to start services at bootup. root# /sbin/service iptables stop Flushing firewall rules: [ OK ] Setting chains to policy ACCEPT: filter [ OK ] Unloading iptables modules: [ OK ] Network nmap Network mapper and port scanner. This command scans a server to locate open ports and the services associated with those ports. It can also report information about packet filters and firewalls. This is an important security tool for locking down a network against hacking attempts. #!/bin/bash SERVER=$HOST # localhost.localdomain (127.0.0.1). PORT_NUMBER=25 # SMTP port. nmap $SERVER | grep -w &quot;$PORT_NUMBER&quot; # Is that particular port open? # grep -w matches whole words only, #+ so this wouldn't match port 1025, for example. exit 0 # 25/tcp open smtp ifconfig Network interface configuration and tuning utility. bash$ ifconfig -a lo Link encap:Local Loopback inet addr:127.0.0.1 Mask:255.0.0.0 UP LOOPBACK RUNNING MTU:16436 Metric:1 RX packets:10 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0 TX packets:10 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0 collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 RX bytes:700 (700.0 b) TX bytes:700 (700.0 b) The ifconfig command is most often used at bootup to set up the interfaces, or to shut them down when rebooting. # Code snippets from /etc/rc.d/init.d/network # ... # Check that networking is up.

See also Example 32-6. netstat Show current network statistics and information, such as routing tables and active connections. This utility accesses information in /proc/net (Chapter 29). See Example 29-4. netstat -r is equivalent to route. bash$ netstat Active Internet connections (w/o servers) Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address Foreign Address State Active UNIX domain sockets (w/o servers) Proto RefCnt Flags Type State I-Node Path unix 11 [ ] DGRAM 906 /dev/log unix 3 [ ] STREAM CONNECTED 4514 /tmp/.X11-unix/X0 unix 3 [ ] STREAM CONNECTED 4513 . . . Note A netstat -lptu shows sockets that are listening to ports, and the associated processes. This can be useful for determining whether a computer has been hacked or compromised. iwconfig This is the command set for configuring a wireless network. It is the wireless equivalent of ifconfig, above. ip General purpose utility for setting up, changing, and analyzing IP (Internet Protocol) networks and attached devices. This command is part of the iproute2 package. bash$ ip link show 1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP&gt; mtu 16436 qdisc noqueue link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00 2: eth0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 1000 link/ether 00:d0:59:ce:af:da brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff 3: sit0: &lt;NOARP&gt; mtu 1480 qdisc noop link/sit 0.0.0.0 brd 0.0.0.0 bash$ ip route list 169.254.0.0/16 dev lo scope link Or, in a script: #!/bin/bash # Script by Juan Nicolas Ruiz # Used with his kind permission. # Setting up (and stopping) a GRE tunnel. # --- start-tunnel.sh --- LOCAL_IP=&quot;192.168.1.17&quot; REMOTE_IP=&quot;10.0.5.33&quot; OTHER_IFACE=&quot;192.168.0.100&quot; REMOTE_NET=&quot;192.168.3.0/24&quot; /sbin/ip tunnel add netb mode gre remote $REMOTE_IP \ local $LOCAL_IP ttl 255 /sbin/ip addr add $OTHER_IFACE dev netb /sbin/ip link set netb up /sbin/ip route add $REMOTE_NET dev netb exit 0 ############################################# # --- stop-tunnel.sh --- REMOTE_NET=&quot;192.168.3.0/24&quot; /sbin/ip route del $REMOTE_NET dev netb /sbin/ip link set netb down /sbin/ip tunnel del netb exit 0 route Show info about or make changes to the kernel routing table. bash$ route Destination Gateway Genmask Flags MSS Window irtt Iface pm3-67.bozosisp * 255.255.255.255 UH 40 0 0 ppp0 127.0.0.0 * 255.0.0.0 U 40 0 0 lo default pm3-67.bozosisp 0.0.0.0 UG 40 0 0 ppp0 iptables The iptables command set is a packet filtering tool used mainly for such security purposes as setting up network firewalls. This is a complex tool, and a detailed explanation of its use is beyond the scope of this document. Oskar Andreasson's tutorial is a reasonable starting point. See also shutting down iptables and Example 30-2. chkconfig Check network and system configuration. This command lists and manages the network and system services started at bootup in the /etc/rc?.d directory. Originally a port from IRIX to Red Hat Linux, chkconfig may not be part of the core installation of some Linux flavors. bash$ chkconfig --list atd 0:off 1:off 2:off 3:on 4:on 5:on 6:off rwhod 0:off 1:off 2:off 3:off 4:off 5:off 6:off ... tcpdump Network packet &quot;sniffer.&quot; This is a tool for analyzing and troubleshooting traffic on a network by dumping packet headers that match specified criteria. Dump ip packet traffic between hosts bozoville and caduceus: bash$ tcpdump ip host bozoville and caduceus Of course, the output of tcpdump can be parsed with certain of the previously discussed text processing utilities. Filesystem mount Mount a filesystem, usually on an external device, such as a floppy or CDROM. The file /etc/fstab provides a handy listing of available filesystems, partitions, and devices, including options, that may be automatically or manually mounted. The file /etc/mtab shows the currently mounted filesystems and partitions (including the virtual ones, such as /proc). mount -a mounts all filesystems and partitions listed in /etc/fstab, except those with a noauto option. At bootup, a startup script in /etc/rc.d (rc.sysinit or something similar) invokes this to get everything mounted. mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom # Mounts CD ROM. ISO 9660 is a standard CD ROM filesystem. mount /mnt/cdrom # Shortcut, if /mnt/cdrom listed in /etc/fstab The versatile mount command can even mount an ordinary file on a block device, and the file will act as if it were a filesystem. Mount accomplishes that by associating the file with a loopback device. One application of this is to mount and examine an ISO9660 filesystem image before burning it onto a CDR. [90] Example 17-7. Checking a CD image # As root... mkdir /mnt/cdtest # Prepare a mount point, if not already there. mount -r -t iso9660 -o loop cd-image.iso /mnt/cdtest # Mount the image. # &quot;-o loop&quot; option equivalent to &quot;losetup /dev/loop0&quot; cd /mnt/cdtest # Now, check the image. ls -alR # List the files in the directory tree there. # And so forth. umount Unmount a currently mounted filesystem. Before physically removing a previously mounted floppy or CDROM disk, the device must be umounted, else filesystem corruption may result. umount /mnt/cdrom # You may now press the eject button and safely remove the disk. Note The automount utility, if properly installed, can mount and unmount floppies or CDROM disks as they are accessed or removed. On &quot;multispindle&quot; laptops with swappable floppy and optical drives, this can cause problems, however. gnome-mount The newer Linux distros have deprecated mount and umount. The successor, for command-line mounting of removable storage devices, is gnome-mount. It can take the -d option to mount a device file by its listing in /dev. For example, to mount a USB flash drive: bash$ gnome-mount -d /dev/sda1 gnome-mount 0.4 bash$ df . . . /dev/sda1 63584 12034 51550 19% /media/disk sync Forces an immediate write of all updated data from buffers to hard drive (synchronize drive with buffers). While not strictly necessary, a sync assures the sys admin or user that the data just changed will survive a sudden power failure. In the olden days, a sync; sync (twice, just to make absolutely sure) was a useful precautionary measure before a system reboot. At times, you may wish to force an immediate buffer flush, as when securely deleting a file (see Example 16-61) or when the lights begin to flicker. losetup Sets up and configures loopback devices. Example 17-8. Creating a filesystem in a file SIZE=1000000 # 1 meg head -c $SIZE &lt; /dev/zero &gt; file # Set up file of designated size. losetup /dev/loop0 file # Set it up as loopback device. mke2fs /dev/loop0 # Create filesystem. mount -o loop /dev/loop0 /mnt # Mount it. # Thanks, S.C. mkswap Creates a swap partition or file. The swap area must subsequently be enabled with swapon. swapon, swapoff Enable / disable swap partitition or file. These commands usually take effect at bootup and shutdown. mke2fs Create a Linux ext2 filesystem. This command must be invoked as root. Example 17-9. Adding a new hard drive #!/bin/bash # Adding a second hard drive to system. # Software configuration. Assumes hardware already mounted. # From an article by the author of the ABS Guide. # In issue #38 of _Linux Gazette_, http://www.linuxgazette.com. ROOT_UID=0 # This script must be run as root. E_NOTROOT=67 # Non-root exit error. if [ &quot;$UID&quot; -ne &quot;$ROOT_UID&quot; ] then echo &quot;Must be root to run this script.&quot; exit $E_NOTROOT fi # Use with extreme caution! # If something goes wrong, you may wipe out your current filesystem. NEWDISK=/dev/hdb # Assumes /dev/hdb vacant. Check! MOUNTPOINT=/mnt/newdisk # Or choose another mount point. fdisk $NEWDISK mke2fs -cv $NEWDISK1 # Check for bad blocks (verbose output). # Note: ^ /dev/hdb1, *not* /dev/hdb! mkdir $MOUNTPOINT chmod 777 $MOUNTPOINT # Makes new drive accessible to all users. # Now, test ... # mount -t ext2 /dev/hdb1 /mnt/newdisk # Try creating a directory. # If it works, umount it, and proceed. # Final step: # Add the following line to /etc/fstab. # /dev/hdb1 /mnt/newdisk ext2 defaults 1 1 exit See also Example 17-8 and Example 31-3. mkdosfs Create a DOS FAT filesystem. tune2fs Tune ext2 filesystem. May be used to change filesystem parameters, such as maximum mount count. This must be invoked as root. Warning This is an extremely dangerous command. Use it at your own risk, as you may inadvertently destroy your filesystem. dumpe2fs Dump (list to stdout) very verbose filesystem info. This must be invoked as root. root# dumpe2fs /dev/hda7 | grep 'ount count' dumpe2fs 1.19, 13-Jul-2000 for EXT2 FS 0.5b, 95/08/09 Mount count: 6 Maximum mount count: 20 hdparm List or change hard disk parameters. This command must be invoked as root, and it may be dangerous if misused. fdisk Create or change a partition table on a storage device, usually a hard drive. This command must be invoked as root. Warning Use this command with extreme caution. If something goes wrong, you may destroy an existing filesystem. fsck, e2fsck, debugfs Filesystem check, repair, and debug command set. fsck: a front end for checking a UNIX filesystem (may invoke other utilities). The actual filesystem type generally defaults to ext2. e2fsck: ext2 filesystem checker. debugfs: ext2 filesystem debugger. One of the uses of this versatile, but dangerous command is to (attempt to) recover deleted files. For advanced users only! Caution All of these should be invoked as root, and they can damage or destroy a filesystem if misused. badblocks Checks for bad blocks (physical media flaws) on a storage device. This command finds use when formatting a newly installed hard drive or testing the integrity of backup media. [91] As an example, badblocks /dev/fd0 tests a floppy disk. The badblocks command may be invoked destructively (overwrite all data) or in non-destructive read-only mode. If root user owns the device to be tested, as is generally the case, then root must invoke this command. lsusb, usbmodules The lsusb command lists all USB (Universal Serial Bus) buses and the devices hooked up to them. The usbmodules command outputs information about the driver modules for connected USB devices. bash$ lsusb Bus 001 Device 001: ID 0000:0000 Device Descriptor: bLength 18 bDescriptorType 1 bcdUSB 1.00 bDeviceClass 9 Hub bDeviceSubClass 0 bDeviceProtocol 0 bMaxPacketSize0 8 idVendor 0x0000 idProduct 0x0000 . . . lspci Lists pci busses present. bash$ lspci 00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation 82845 845 (Brookdale) Chipset Host Bridge (rev 04) 00:01.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 82845 845 (Brookdale) Chipset AGP Bridge (rev 04) 00:1d.0 USB Controller: Intel Corporation 82801CA/CAM USB (Hub #1) (rev 02) 00:1d.1 USB Controller: Intel Corporation 82801CA/CAM USB (Hub #2) (rev 02) 00:1d.2 USB Controller: Intel Corporation 82801CA/CAM USB (Hub #3) (rev 02) 00:1e.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 82801 Mobile PCI Bridge (rev 42) . . . mkbootdisk Creates a boot floppy which can be used to bring up the system if, for example, the MBR (master boot record) becomes corrupted. Of special interest is the --iso option, which uses mkisofs to create a bootable ISO9660 filesystem image suitable for burning a bootable CDR. The mkbootdisk command is actually a Bash script, written by Erik Troan, in the /sbin directory. mkisofs Creates an ISO9660 filesystem suitable for a CDR image. chroot CHange ROOT directory. Normally commands are fetched from $PATH, relative to /, the default root directory. This changes the root directory to a different one (and also changes the working directory to there). This is useful for security purposes, for instance when the system administrator wishes to restrict certain users, such as those telnetting in, to a secured portion of the filesystem (this is sometimes referred to as confining a guest user to a &quot;chroot jail&quot;). Note that after a chroot, the execution path for system binaries is no longer valid. A chroot /opt would cause references to /usr/bin to be translated to /opt/usr/bin. Likewise, chroot /aaa/bbb /bin/ls would redirect future instances of ls to /aaa/bbb as the base directory, rather than / as is normally the case. An alias XX 'chroot /aaa/bbb ls' in a user's ~/.bashrc effectively restricts which portion of the filesystem she may run command &quot;XX&quot; on. The chroot command is also handy when running from an emergency boot floppy (chroot to /dev/fd0), or as an option to lilo when recovering from a system crash. Other uses include installation from a different filesystem (an rpm option) or running a readonly filesystem from a CD ROM. Invoke only as root, and use with care. Caution It might be necessary to copy certain system files to a chrooted directory, since the normal $PATH can no longer be relied upon. lockfile This utility is part of the procmail package (www.procmail.org). It creates a lock file, a semaphore that controls access to a file, device, or resource. Definition: A semaphore is a flag or signal. (The usage originated in railroading, where a colored flag, lantern, or striped movable arm semaphore indicated whether a particular track was in use and therefore unavailable for another train.) A UNIX process can check the appropriate semaphore to determine whether a particular resource is available/accessible. The lock file serves as a flag that this particular file, device, or resource is in use by a process (and is therefore &quot;busy&quot;). The presence of a lock file permits only restricted access (or no access) to other processes. lockfile /home/bozo/lockfiles/$0.lock # Creates a write-protected lockfile prefixed with the name of the script. lockfile /home/bozo/lockfiles/${0##*/}.lock # A safer version of the above, as pointed out by E. Choroba. Lock files are used in such applications as protecting system mail folders from simultaneously being changed by multiple users, indicating that a modem port is being accessed, and showing that an instance of Firefox is using its cache. Scripts may check for the existence of a lock file created by a certain process to check if that process is running. Note that if a script attempts to create a lock file that already exists, the script will likely hang. Normally, applications create and check for lock files in the /var/lock directory. [92] A script can test for the presence of a lock file by something like the following. appname=xyzip # Application &quot;xyzip&quot; created lock file &quot;/var/lock/xyzip.lock&quot;. if [ -e &quot;/var/lock/$appname.lock&quot; ] then #+ Prevent other programs &amp; scripts # from accessing files/resources used by xyzip. ... flock Much less useful than the lockfile command is flock. It sets an &quot;advisory&quot; lock on a file and then executes a command while the lock is on. This is to prevent any other process from setting a lock on that file until completion of the specified command. flock $0 cat $0 &gt; lockfile__$0 # Set a lock on the script the above line appears in, #+ while listing the script to stdout. Note Unlike lockfile, flock does not automatically create a lock file. mknod Creates block or character device files (may be necessary when installing new hardware on the system). The MAKEDEV utility has virtually all of the functionality of mknod, and is easier to use. MAKEDEV Utility for creating device files. It must be run as root, and in the /dev directory. It is a sort of advanced version of mknod. tmpwatch Automatically deletes files which have not been accessed within a specified period of time. Usually invoked by cron to remove stale log files. Backup dump, restore The dump command is an elaborate filesystem backup utility, generally used on larger installations and networks. [93] It reads raw disk partitions and writes a backup file in a binary format. Files to be backed up may be saved to a variety of storage media, including disks and tape drives. The restore command restores backups made with dump. fdformat Perform a low-level format on a floppy disk (/dev/fd0*). System Resources ulimit Sets an upper limit on use of system resources. Usually invoked with the -f option, which sets a limit on file size (ulimit -f 1000 limits files to 1 meg maximum). [94] The -t option limits the coredump size (ulimit -c 0 eliminates coredumps). Normally, the value of ulimit would be set in /etc/profile and/or ~/.bash_profile (see Appendix H). Important Judicious use of ulimit can protect a system against the dreaded fork bomb. #!/bin/bash # This script is for illustrative purposes only. # Run it at your own peril -- it WILL freeze your system. while true # Endless loop. do $0 &amp; # This script invokes itself . . . #+ forks an infinite number of times . . . #+ until the system freezes up because all resources exhausted. done # This is the notorious &quot;sorcerer's appentice&quot; scenario. exit 0 # Will not exit here, because this script will never terminate. A ulimit -Hu XX (where XX is the user process limit) in /etc/profile would abort this script when it exceeded the preset limit. quota Display user or group disk quotas. setquota Set user or group disk quotas from the command-line. umask User file creation permissions mask. Limit the default file attributes for a particular user. All files created by that user take on the attributes specified by umask. The (octal) value passed to umask defines the file permissions disabled. For example, umask 022 ensures that new files will have at most 755 permissions (777 NAND 022). [95] Of course, the user may later change the attributes of particular files with chmod. The usual practice is to set the value of umask in /etc/profile and/or ~/.bash_profile (see Appendix H). Example 17-10. Using umask to hide an output file from prying eyes #!/bin/bash # rot13a.sh: Same as &quot;rot13.sh&quot; script, but writes output to &quot;secure&quot; file. # Usage: ./rot13a.sh filename # or ./rot13a.sh &lt;filename # or ./rot13a.sh and supply keyboard input (stdin) umask 177 # File creation mask. # Files created by this script #+ will have 600 permissions. OUTFILE=decrypted.txt # Results output to file &quot;decrypted.txt&quot; #+ which can only be read/written # by invoker of script (or root). cat &quot;$@&quot; | tr 'a-zA-Z' 'n-za-mN-ZA-M' &gt; $OUTFILE # ^^ Input from stdin or a file. ^^^^^^^^^^ Output redirected to file. exit 0 rdev Get info about or make changes to root device, swap space, or video mode. The functionality of rdev has generally been taken over by lilo, but rdev remains useful for setting up a ram disk. This is a dangerous command, if misused. Modules lsmod List installed kernel modules. bash$ lsmod Module Size Used by autofs 9456 2 (autoclean) opl3 11376 0 serial_cs 5456 0 (unused) sb 34752 0 uart401 6384 0 [sb] sound 58368 0 [opl3 sb uart401] soundlow 464 0 [sound] soundcore 2800 6 [sb sound] ds 6448 2 [serial_cs] i82365 22928 2 pcmcia_core 45984 0 [serial_cs ds i82365] Note Doing a cat /proc/modules gives the same information. insmod Force installation of a kernel module (use modprobe instead, when possible). Must be invoked as root. rmmod Force unloading of a kernel module. Must be invoked as root. modprobe Module loader that is normally invoked automatically in a startup script. Must be invoked as root. depmod Creates module dependency file.

This decreases its size, but makes debugging it impossible. This command often occurs in a Makefile, but rarely in a shell script. nm List symbols in an unstripped compiled binary. xrandr Command-line tool for manipulating the root window of the screen.

Analyzing a System Script Using our knowledge of administrative commands, let us examine a system script. One of the shortest and simplest to understand scripts is &quot;killall,&quot; [97] used to suspend running processes at system shutdown. Example 17-12. killall, from /etc/rc.d/init.d #!/bin/sh # --&gt; Comments added by the author of this document marked by &quot;# --&gt;&quot;. # --&gt; This is part of the 'rc' script package # --&gt; by Miquel van Smoorenburg, &lt;miquels@drinkel.nl.mugnet.org&gt;. # --&gt; This particular script seems to be Red Hat / FC specific # --&gt; (may not be present in other distributions). # Bring down all unneeded services that are still running #+ (there shouldn't be any, so this is just a sanity check) for i in /var/lock/subsys/*; do # --&gt; Standard for/in loop, but since &quot;do&quot; is on same line, # --&gt; it is necessary to add &quot;;&quot;. # Check if the script is there. [ ! -f $i ] &amp;&amp; continue # --&gt; This is a clever use of an &quot;and list&quot;, equivalent to: # --&gt; if [ ! -f &quot;$i&quot; ]; then continue # Get the subsystem name. subsys=${i#/var/lock/subsys/} # --&gt; Match variable name, which, in this case, is the file name. # --&gt; This is the exact equivalent of subsys=`basename $i`. # --&gt; It gets it from the lock file name # --&gt;+ (if there is a lock file, # --&gt;+ that's proof the process has been running). # --&gt; See the &quot;lockfile&quot; entry, above. # Bring the subsystem down. if [ -f /etc/rc.d/init.d/$subsys.init ]; then /etc/rc.d/init.d/$subsys.init stop else /etc/rc.d/init.d/$subsys stop # --&gt; Suspend running jobs and daemons. # --&gt; Note that &quot;stop&quot; is a positional parameter, # --&gt;+ not a shell builtin. fi done That wasn't so bad. Aside from a little fancy footwork with variable matching, there is no new material there. Exercise 1. In /etc/rc.d/init.d, analyze the halt script. It is a bit longer than killall, but similar in concept. Make a copy of this script somewhere in your home directory and experiment with it (do not run it as root). Do a simulated run with the -vn flags (sh -vn scriptname). Add extensive comments. Change the commands to echos. Exercise 2. Look at some of the more complex scripts in /etc/rc.d/init.d. Try to understand at least portions of them. Follow the above procedure to analyze them. For some additional insight, you might also examine the file sysvinitfiles in /usr/share/doc/initscripts-?.??, which is part of the &quot;initscripts&quot; documentation. Part 5. Advanced Topics At this point, we are ready to delve into certain of the difficult and unusual aspects of scripting. Along the way, we will attempt to &quot;push the envelope&quot; in various ways and examine boundary conditions (what happens when we move into uncharted territory?). Table of Contents 18.

Regular Expressions . . . the intellectual activity associated with software development is largely one of gaining insight. --Stowe Boyd To fully utilize the power of shell scripting, you need to master Regular Expressions. Certain commands and utilities commonly used in scripts, such as grep, expr, sed and awk, interpret and use REs. As of version 3, Bash has acquired its own RE-match operator: =~. 18.1. A Brief Introduction to Regular Expressions An expression is a string of characters. Those characters having an interpretation above and beyond their literal meaning are called metacharacters. A quote symbol, for example, may denote speech by a person, ditto, or a meta-meaning [98] for the symbols that follow. Regular Expressions are sets of characters and/or metacharacters that match (or specify) patterns. A Regular Expression contains one or more of the following: A character set. These are the characters retaining their literal meaning. The simplest type of Regular Expression consists only of a character set, with no metacharacters. An anchor. These designate (anchor) the position in the line of text that the RE is to match. For example, ^, and $ are anchors. Modifiers. These expand or narrow (modify) the range of text the RE is to match. Modifiers include the asterisk, brackets, and the backslash. The main uses for Regular Expressions (REs) are text searches and string manipulation. An RE matches a single character or a set of characters -- a string or a part of a string. The asterisk -- * -- matches any number of repeats of the character string or RE preceding it, including zero instances. &quot;1133*&quot; matches 11 + one or more 3's: 113, 1133, 1133333, and so forth. The dot -- . -- matches any one character, except a newline. [99] &quot;13.&quot; matches 13 + at least one of any character (including a space): 1133, 11333, but not 13 (additional character missing). See Example 16-18 for a demonstration of dot single-character matching. The caret -- ^ -- matches the beginning of a line, but sometimes, depending on context, negates the meaning of a set of characters in an RE. The dollar sign -- $ -- at the end of an RE matches the end of a line. &quot;XXX$&quot; matches XXX at the end of a line. &quot;^$&quot; matches blank lines. Brackets -- [...] -- enclose a set of characters to match in a single RE. &quot;[xyz]&quot; matches any one of the characters x, y, or z. &quot;[c-n]&quot; matches any one of the characters in the range c to n. &quot;[B-Pk-y]&quot; matches any one of the characters in the ranges B to P and k to y. &quot;[a-z0-9]&quot; matches any single lowercase letter or any digit. &quot;[^b-d]&quot; matches any character except those in the range b to d. This is an instance of ^ negating or inverting the meaning of the following RE (taking on a role similar to ! in a different context). Combined sequences of bracketed characters match common word patterns. &quot;[Yy][Ee][Ss]&quot; matches yes, Yes, YES, yEs, and so forth. &quot;[0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]&quot; matches any Social Security number. The backslash -- \ -- escapes a special character, which means that character gets interpreted literally (and is therefore no longer special). A &quot;\$&quot; reverts back to its literal meaning of &quot;$&quot;, rather than its RE meaning of end-of-line. Likewise a &quot;\\&quot; has the literal meaning of &quot;\&quot;. Escaped &quot;angle brackets&quot; -- \&lt;...\&gt; -- mark word boundaries. The angle brackets must be escaped, since otherwise they have only their literal character meaning. &quot;\&lt;the\&gt;&quot; matches the word &quot;the,&quot; but not the words &quot;them,&quot; &quot;there,&quot; &quot;other,&quot; etc. bash$ cat textfile This is line 1, of which there is only one instance. This is the only instance of line 2. This is line 3, another line. This is line 4. bash$ grep 'the' textfile This is line 1, of which there is only one instance. This is the only instance of line 2. This is line 3, another line. bash$ grep '\&lt;the\&gt;' textfile This is the only instance of line 2. The only way to be certain that a particular RE works is to test it. TEST FILE: tstfile # No match. # No match. Run grep &quot;1133*&quot; on this file. # Match. # No match. # No match. This line contains the number 113. # Match. This line contains the number 13. # No match. This line contains the number 133. # No match. This line contains the number 1133. # Match. This line contains the number 113312. # Match. This line contains the number 1112. # No match. This line contains the number 113312312. # Match. This line contains no numbers at all. # No match. bash$ grep &quot;1133*&quot; tstfile Run grep &quot;1133*&quot; on this file. # Match. This line contains the number 113. # Match. This line contains the number 1133. # Match. This line contains the number 113312. # Match. This line contains the number 113312312. # Match. Extended REs. Additional metacharacters added to the basic set. Used in egrep, awk, and Perl. The question mark -- ? -- matches zero or one of the previous RE. It is generally used for matching single characters. The plus -- + -- matches one or more of the previous RE. It serves a role similar to the *, but does not match zero occurrences. # GNU versions of sed and awk can use &quot;+&quot;, # but it needs to be escaped. echo a111b | sed -ne '/a1\+b/p' echo a111b | grep 'a1\+b' echo a111b | gawk '/a1+b/' # All of above are equivalent. # Thanks, S.C. Escaped &quot;curly brackets&quot; -- \{ \} -- indicate the number of occurrences of a preceding RE to match. It is necessary to escape the curly brackets since they have only their literal character meaning otherwise. This usage is technically not part of the basic RE set. &quot;[0-9]\{5\}&quot; matches exactly five digits (characters in the range of 0 to 9). Note Curly brackets are not available as an RE in the &quot;classic&quot; (non-POSIX compliant) version of awk. However, the GNU extended version of awk, gawk, has the --re-interval option that permits them (without being escaped). bash$ echo 2222 | gawk --re-interval '/2{3}/' 2222 Perl and some egrep versions do not require escaping the curly brackets. Parentheses -- ( ) -- enclose a group of REs. They are useful with the following &quot;|&quot; operator and in substring extraction using expr. The -- | -- &quot;or&quot; RE operator matches any of a set of alternate characters. bash$ egrep 're(a|e)d' misc.txt People who read seem to be better informed than those who do not. The clarinet produces sound by the vibration of its reed. Note Some versions of sed, ed, and ex support escaped versions of the extended Regular Expressions described above, as do the GNU utilities. POSIX Character Classes. [:class:] This is an alternate method of specifying a range of characters to match. [:alnum:] matches alphabetic or numeric characters. This is equivalent to A-Za-z0-9. [:alpha:] matches alphabetic characters. This is equivalent to A-Za-z. [:blank:] matches a space or a tab. [:cntrl:] matches control characters. [:digit:] matches (decimal) digits. This is equivalent to 0-9. [:graph:] (graphic printable characters). Matches characters in the range of ASCII 33 - 126. This is the same as [:print:], below, but excluding the space character. [:lower:] matches lowercase alphabetic characters. This is equivalent to a-z. [:print:] (printable characters). Matches characters in the range of ASCII 32 - 126. This is the same as [:graph:], above, but adding the space character. [:space:] matches whitespace characters (space and horizontal tab). [:upper:] matches uppercase alphabetic characters. This is equivalent to A-Z. [:xdigit:] matches hexadecimal digits. This is equivalent to 0-9A-Fa-f. Important POSIX character classes generally require quoting or double brackets ([[ ]]). bash$ grep [[:digit:]] test.file abc=723 # ... if [[ $arow =~ [[:digit:]] ]] # Numerical input? then # POSIX char class if [[ $acol =~ [[:alpha:]] ]] # Number followed by a letter? Illegal! # ... # From ktour.sh example script. These character classes may even be used with globbing, to a limited extent. bash$ ls -l ?[[:digit:]][[:digit:]]? -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Aug 21 14:47 a33b POSIX character classes are used in Example 16-21 and Example 16-22. Sed, awk, and Perl, used as filters in scripts, take REs as arguments when &quot;sifting&quot; or transforming files or I/O streams. See Example A-12 and Example A-16 for illustrations of this. The standard reference on this complex topic is Friedl's Mastering Regular Expressions. Sed &amp; Awk, by Dougherty and Robbins, also gives a very lucid treatment of REs. See the Bibliography for more information on these books. 18.2. Globbing Bash itself cannot recognize Regular Expressions. Inside scripts, it is commands and utilities -- such as sed and awk -- that interpret RE's. Bash does carry out filename expansion [100] -- a process known as globbing -- but this does not use the standard RE set. Instead, globbing recognizes and expands wild cards. Globbing interprets the standard wild card characters [101] -- * and ?, character lists in square brackets, and certain other special characters (such as ^ for negating the sense of a match). There are important limitations on wild card characters in globbing, however. Strings containing * will not match filenames that start with a dot, as, for example, .bashrc. [102] Likewise, the ? has a different meaning in globbing than as part of an RE. bash$ ls -l total 2 -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Aug 6 18:42 a.1 -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Aug 6 18:42 b.1 -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Aug 6 18:42 c.1 -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 466 Aug 6 17:48 t2.sh -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 758 Jul 30 09:02 test1.txt bash$ ls -l t?.sh -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 466 Aug 6 17:48 t2.sh bash$ ls -l [ab]* -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Aug 6 18:42 a.1 -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Aug 6 18:42 b.1 bash$ ls -l [a-c]* -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Aug 6 18:42 a.1 -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Aug 6 18:42 b.1 -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Aug 6 18:42 c.1 bash$ ls -l [^ab]* -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Aug 6 18:42 c.1 -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 466 Aug 6 17:48 t2.sh -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 758 Jul 30 09:02 test1.txt bash$ ls -l {b*,c*,*est*} -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Aug 6 18:42 b.1 -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Aug 6 18:42 c.1 -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 758 Jul 30 09:02 test1.txt Bash performs filename expansion on unquoted command-line arguments. The echo command demonstrates this. bash$ echo * a.1 b.1 c.1 t2.sh test1.txt bash$ echo t* t2.sh test1.txt bash$ echo t?.sh t2.sh Note It is possible to modify the way Bash interprets special characters in globbing. A set -f command disables globbing, and the nocaseglob and nullglob options to shopt change globbing behavior. See also Example 11-5. Caution Filenames with embedded whitespace can cause globbing to choke. David Wheeler shows how to avoid many such pitfalls. IFS=&quot;$(printf '\n\t')&quot; # Remove space. # Correct glob use: # Always use for-loop, prefix glob, check if exists file. for file in ./* ; do # Use ./* ... NEVER bare * if [ -e &quot;$file&quot; ] ; then # Check whether file exists. COMMAND ... &quot;$file&quot; ... fi done # This example taken from David Wheeler's site, with permission. Chapter 19. Here Documents Here and now, boys. --Aldous Huxley, Island A here document is a special-purpose code block. It uses a form of I/O redirection to feed a command list to an interactive program or a command, such as ftp, cat, or the ex text editor. COMMAND &lt;&lt;InputComesFromHERE ... ... ... InputComesFromHERE A limit string delineates (frames) the command list. The special symbol &lt;&lt; precedes the limit string. This has the effect of redirecting the output of a command block into the stdin of the program or command. It is similar to interactive-program &lt; command-file, where command-file contains command #1 command #2 ... The here document equivalent looks like this: interactive-program &lt;&lt;LimitString command #1 command #2 ... LimitString Choose a limit string sufficiently unusual that it will not occur anywhere in the command list and confuse matters. Note that here documents may sometimes be used to good effect with non-interactive utilities and commands, such as, for example, wall. Example 19-1. broadcast: Sends message to everyone logged in #!/bin/bash wall &lt;&lt;zzz23EndOfMessagezzz23 E-mail your noontime orders for pizza to the system administrator. (Add an extra dollar for anchovy or mushroom topping.) # Additional message text goes here. # Note: 'wall' prints comment lines. zzz23EndOfMessagezzz23 # Could have been done more efficiently by # wall &lt;message-file # However, embedding the message template in a script #+ is a quick-and-dirty one-off solution. exit Even such unlikely candidates as the vi text editor lend themselves to here documents. Example 19-2. dummyfile: Creates a 2-line dummy file #!/bin/bash # Noninteractive use of 'vi' to edit a file. # Emulates 'sed'. E_BADARGS=85 if [ -z &quot;$1&quot; ] then echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` filename&quot; exit $E_BADARGS fi TARGETFILE=$1 # Insert 2 lines in file, then save. #--------Begin here document-----------# vi $TARGETFILE &lt;&lt;x23LimitStringx23 i This is line 1 of the example file. This is line 2 of the example file. ^[ ZZ x23LimitStringx23 #----------End here document-----------# # Note that ^[ above is a literal escape #+ typed by Control-V &lt;Esc&gt;. # Bram Moolenaar points out that this may not work with 'vim' #+ because of possible problems with terminal interaction. exit The above script could just as effectively have been implemented with ex, rather than vi. Here documents containing a list of ex commands are common enough to form their own category, known as ex scripts. #!/bin/bash # Replace all instances of &quot;Smith&quot; with &quot;Jones&quot; #+ in files with a &quot;.txt&quot; filename suffix. ORIGINAL=Smith REPLACEMENT=Jones for word in $(fgrep -l $ORIGINAL *.txt) do # ------------------------------------- ex $word &lt;&lt;EOF :%s/$ORIGINAL/$REPLACEMENT/g :wq EOF # :%s is the &quot;ex&quot; substitution command. # :wq is write-and-quit. # ------------------------------------- done Analogous to &quot;ex scripts&quot; are cat scripts. Example 19-3. Multi-line message using cat #!/bin/bash # 'echo' is fine for printing single line messages, #+ but somewhat problematic for for message blocks. # A 'cat' here document overcomes this limitation. cat &lt;&lt;End-of-message ------------------------------------- This is line 1 of the message. This is line 2 of the message. This is line 3 of the message. This is line 4 of the message. This is the last line of the message. ------------------------------------- End-of-message # Replacing line 7, above, with #+ cat &gt; $Newfile &lt;&lt;End-of-message #+ ^^^^^^^^^^ #+ writes the output to the file $Newfile, rather than to stdout. exit 0 #-------------------------------------------- # Code below disabled, due to &quot;exit 0&quot; above. # S.C. points out that the following also works. echo &quot;------------------------------------- This is line 1 of the message. This is line 2 of the message. This is line 3 of the message. This is line 4 of the message. This is the last line of the message. -------------------------------------&quot; # However, text may not include double quotes unless they are escaped. The - option to mark a here document limit string (&lt;&lt;-LimitString) suppresses leading tabs (but not spaces) in the output. This may be useful in making a script more readable. Example 19-4. Multi-line message, with tabs suppressed #!/bin/bash # Same as previous example, but... # The - option to a here document &lt;&lt;- #+ suppresses leading tabs in the body of the document, #+ but *not* spaces. cat &lt;&lt;-ENDOFMESSAGE This is line 1 of the message. This is line 2 of the message. This is line 3 of the message. This is line 4 of the message. This is the last line of the message. ENDOFMESSAGE # The output of the script will be flush left. # Leading tab in each line will not show. # Above 5 lines of &quot;message&quot; prefaced by a tab, not spaces. # Spaces not affected by &lt;&lt;- . # Note that this option has no effect on *embedded* tabs. exit 0 A here document supports parameter and command substitution. It is therefore possible to pass different parameters to the body of the here document, changing its output accordingly. Example 19-5. Here document with replaceable parameters #!/bin/bash # Another 'cat' here document, using parameter substitution. # Try it with no command-line parameters, ./scriptname # Try it with one command-line parameter, ./scriptname Mortimer # Try it with one two-word quoted command-line parameter, # ./scriptname &quot;Mortimer Jones&quot; CMDLINEPARAM=1 # Expect at least command-line parameter. if [ $# -ge $CMDLINEPARAM ] then NAME=$1 # If more than one command-line param, #+ then just take the first. else NAME=&quot;John Doe&quot; # Default, if no command-line parameter. fi RESPONDENT=&quot;the author of this fine script&quot; cat &lt;&lt;Endofmessage Hello, there, $NAME. Greetings to you, $NAME, from $RESPONDENT. # This comment shows up in the output (why?). Endofmessage # Note that the blank lines show up in the output. # So does the comment. exit This is a useful script containing a here document with parameter substitution. Example 19-6. Upload a file pair to Sunsite incoming directory #!/bin/bash # upload.sh # Upload file pair (Filename.lsm, Filename.tar.gz) #+ to incoming directory at Sunsite/UNC (ibiblio.org). # Filename.tar.gz is the tarball itself. # Filename.lsm is the descriptor file. # Sunsite requires &quot;lsm&quot; file, otherwise will bounce contributions. E_ARGERROR=85 if [ -z &quot;$1&quot; ] then echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` Filename-to-upload&quot; exit $E_ARGERROR fi Filename=`basename $1` # Strips pathname out of file name. Server=&quot;ibiblio.org&quot; Directory=&quot;/incoming/Linux&quot; # These need not be hard-coded into script, #+ but may instead be changed to command-line argument. Password=&quot;your.e-mail.address&quot; # Change above to suit. ftp -n $Server &lt;&lt;End-Of-Session # -n option disables auto-logon user anonymous &quot;$Password&quot; # If this doesn't work, then try: # quote user anonymous &quot;$Password&quot; binary bell # Ring 'bell' after each file transfer. cd $Directory put &quot;$Filename.lsm&quot; put &quot;$Filename.tar.gz&quot; bye End-Of-Session exit 0 Quoting or escaping the &quot;limit string&quot; at the head of a here document disables parameter substitution within its body. The reason for this is that quoting/escaping the limit string effectively escapes the $, `, and \ special characters, and causes them to be interpreted literally. (Thank you, Allen Halsey, for pointing this out.) Example 19-7. Parameter substitution turned off #!/bin/bash # A 'cat' here-document, but with parameter substitution disabled. NAME=&quot;John Doe&quot; RESPONDENT=&quot;the author of this fine script&quot; cat &lt;&lt;'Endofmessage' Hello, there, $NAME. Greetings to you, $NAME, from $RESPONDENT. Endofmessage # No parameter substitution when the &quot;limit string&quot; is quoted or escaped. # Either of the following at the head of the here document would have #+ the same effect. # cat &lt;&lt;&quot;Endofmessage&quot; # cat &lt;&lt;\Endofmessage # And, likewise: cat &lt;&lt;&quot;SpecialCharTest&quot; Directory listing would follow if limit string were not quoted. `ls -l` Arithmetic expansion would take place if limit string were not quoted. $((5 + 3)) A a single backslash would echo if limit string were not quoted. \\ SpecialCharTest exit Disabling parameter substitution permits outputting literal text. Generating scripts or even program code is one use for this. Example 19-8. A script that generates another script #!/bin/bash # generate-script.sh # Based on an idea by Albert Reiner. OUTFILE=generated.sh # Name of the file to generate. # ----------------------------------------------------------- # 'Here document containing the body of the generated script. ( cat &lt;&lt;'EOF' #!/bin/bash echo &quot;This is a generated shell script.&quot; # Note that since we are inside a subshell, #+ we can't access variables in the &quot;outside&quot; script. echo &quot;Generated file will be named: $OUTFILE&quot; # Above line will not work as normally expected #+ because parameter expansion has been disabled. # Instead, the result is literal output. a=7 b=3 let &quot;c = $a * $b&quot; echo &quot;c = $c&quot; exit 0 EOF ) &gt; $OUTFILE # ----------------------------------------------------------- # Quoting the 'limit string' prevents variable expansion #+ within the body of the above 'here document.' # This permits outputting literal strings in the output file. if [ -f &quot;$OUTFILE&quot; ] then chmod 755 $OUTFILE # Make the generated file executable. else echo &quot;Problem in creating file: \&quot;$OUTFILE\&quot;&quot; fi # This method also works for generating #+ C programs, Perl programs, Python programs, Makefiles, #+ and the like. exit 0 It is possible to set a variable from the output of a here document. This is actually a devious form of command substitution. variable=$(cat &lt;&lt;SETVAR This variable runs over multiple lines. SETVAR ) echo &quot;$variable&quot; A here document can supply input to a function in the same script. Example 19-9. Here documents and functions #!/bin/bash # here-function.sh GetPersonalData () { read firstname read lastname read address read city read state read zipcode } # This certainly appears to be an interactive function, but . . . # Supply input to the above function. GetPersonalData &lt;&lt;RECORD001 Bozo Bozeman 2726 Nondescript Dr. Bozeman MT 21226 RECORD001 echo echo &quot;$firstname $lastname&quot; echo &quot;$address&quot; echo &quot;$city, $state $zipcode&quot; echo exit 0 It is possible to use : as a dummy command accepting output from a here document. This, in effect, creates an &quot;anonymous&quot; here document. Example 19-10. &quot;Anonymous&quot; Here Document #!/bin/bash : &lt;&lt;TESTVARIABLES ${HOSTNAME?}${USER?}${MAIL?} # Print error message if one of the variables not set. TESTVARIABLES exit $? Tip A variation of the above technique permits &quot;commenting out&quot; blocks of code. Example 19-11. Commenting out a block of code #!/bin/bash # commentblock.sh : &lt;&lt;COMMENTBLOCK echo &quot;This line will not echo.&quot; This is a comment line missing the &quot;#&quot; prefix. This is another comment line missing the &quot;#&quot; prefix. &amp;*@!!++= The above line will cause no error message, because the Bash interpreter will ignore it. COMMENTBLOCK echo &quot;Exit value of above \&quot;COMMENTBLOCK\&quot; is $?.&quot; # 0 # No error shown. echo # The above technique also comes in useful for commenting out #+ a block of working code for debugging purposes. # This saves having to put a &quot;#&quot; at the beginning of each line, #+ then having to go back and delete each &quot;#&quot; later. # Note that the use of of colon, above, is optional. echo &quot;Just before commented-out code block.&quot; # The lines of code between the double-dashed lines will not execute. # =================================================================== : &lt;&lt;DEBUGXXX for file in * do cat &quot;$file&quot; done DEBUGXXX # =================================================================== echo &quot;Just after commented-out code block.&quot; exit 0 ###################################################################### # Note, however, that if a bracketed variable is contained within #+ the commented-out code block, #+ then this could cause problems. # for example: #/!/bin/bash : &lt;&lt;COMMENTBLOCK echo &quot;This line will not echo.&quot; &amp;*@!!++= ${foo_bar_bazz?} $(rm -rf /tmp/foobar/) $(touch my_build_directory/cups/Makefile) COMMENTBLOCK $ sh commented-bad.sh commented-bad.sh: line 3: foo_bar_bazz: parameter null or not set # The remedy for this is to strong-quote the 'COMMENTBLOCK' in line 49, above. : &lt;&lt;'COMMENTBLOCK' # Thank you, Kurt Pfeifle, for pointing this out. Tip Yet another twist of this nifty trick makes &quot;self-documenting&quot; scripts possible. Example 19-12. A self-documenting script #!/bin/bash # self-document.sh: self-documenting script # Modification of &quot;colm.sh&quot;. DOC_REQUEST=70 if [ &quot;$1&quot; = &quot;-h&quot; -o &quot;$1&quot; = &quot;--help&quot; ] # Request help. then echo; echo &quot;Usage: $0 [directory-name]&quot;; echo sed --silent -e '/DOCUMENTATIONXX$/,/^DOCUMENTATIONXX$/p' &quot;$0&quot; | sed -e '/DOCUMENTATIONXX$/d'; exit $DOC_REQUEST; fi : &lt;&lt;DOCUMENTATIONXX List the statistics of a specified directory in tabular format. --------------------------------------------------------------- The command-line parameter gives the directory to be listed. If no directory specified or directory specified cannot be read, then list the current working directory.

DOC_REQUEST=70 if [ &quot;$1&quot; = &quot;-h&quot; -o &quot;$1&quot; = &quot;--help&quot; ] # Request help. then # Use a &quot;cat script&quot; . . . cat &lt;&lt;DOCUMENTATIONXX List the statistics of a specified directory in tabular format. --------------------------------------------------------------- The command-line parameter gives the directory to be listed. If no directory specified or directory specified cannot be read, then list the current working directory. DOCUMENTATIONXX exit $DOC_REQUEST fi See also Example A-28, Example A-40, Example A-41, and Example A-42 for more examples of self-documenting scripts. Note Here documents create temporary files, but these files are deleted after opening and are not accessible to any other process. bash$ bash -c 'lsof -a -p $$ -d0' &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; EOF lsof 1213 bozo 0r REG 3,5 0 30386 /tmp/t1213-0-sh (deleted) Caution Some utilities will not work inside a here document. Warning The closing limit string, on the final line of a here document, must start in the first character position. There can be no leading whitespace. Trailing whitespace after the limit string likewise causes unexpected behavior. The whitespace prevents the limit string from being recognized. [103] #!/bin/bash echo &quot;----------------------------------------------------------------------&quot; cat &lt;&lt;LimitString echo &quot;This is line 1 of the message inside the here document.&quot; echo &quot;This is line 2 of the message inside the here document.&quot; echo &quot;This is the final line of the message inside the here document.&quot; LimitString #^^^^Indented limit string. Error! This script will not behave as expected. echo &quot;----------------------------------------------------------------------&quot; # These comments are outside the 'here document', #+ and should not echo. echo &quot;Outside the here document.&quot; exit 0 echo &quot;This line had better not echo.&quot; # Follows an 'exit' command. Caution Some people very cleverly use a single ! as a limit string. But, that's not necessarily a good idea. # This works. cat &lt;&lt;! Hello! ! Three more exclamations !!! ! # But . . . cat &lt;&lt;! Hello! Single exclamation point follows! ! ! # Crashes with an error message. # However, the following will work. cat &lt;&lt;EOF Hello! Single exclamation point follows! ! EOF # It's safer to use a multi-character limit string. For those tasks too complex for a here document, consider using the expect scripting language, which was specifically designed for feeding input into interactive programs. 19.1. Here Strings A here string can be considered as a stripped-down form of a here document. It consists of nothing more than COMMAND &lt;&lt;&lt; $WORD, where $WORD is expanded and fed to the stdin of COMMAND. As a simple example, consider this alternative to the echo-grep construction. # Instead of: if echo &quot;$VAR&quot; | grep -q txt # if [[ $VAR = *txt* ]] # etc. # Try: if grep -q &quot;txt&quot; &lt;&lt;&lt; &quot;$VAR&quot; then # ^^^ echo &quot;$VAR contains the substring sequence \&quot;txt\&quot;&quot; fi # Thank you, Sebastian Kaminski, for the suggestion. Or, in combination with read: String=&quot;This is a string of words.&quot; read -r -a Words &lt;&lt;&lt; &quot;$String&quot; # The -a option to &quot;read&quot; #+ assigns the resulting values to successive members of an array. echo &quot;First word in String is: ${Words[0]}&quot; # This echo &quot;Second word in String is: ${Words[1]}&quot; # is echo &quot;Third word in String is: ${Words[2]}&quot; # a echo &quot;Fourth word in String is: ${Words[3]}&quot; # string echo &quot;Fifth word in String is: ${Words[4]}&quot; # of echo &quot;Sixth word in String is: ${Words[5]}&quot; # words. echo &quot;Seventh word in String is: ${Words[6]}&quot; # (null) # Past end of $String. # Thank you, Francisco Lobo, for the suggestion. It is, of course, possible to feed the output of a here string into the stdin of a loop. # As Seamus points out . . . ArrayVar=( element0 element1 element2 {A..D} ) while read element ; do echo &quot;$element&quot; 1&gt;&amp;2 done &lt;&lt;&lt; $(echo ${ArrayVar[*]}) # element0 element1 element2 A B C D Example 19-13.

Chapter 20. I/O Redirection There are always three default files [104] open, stdin (the keyboard), stdout (the screen), and stderr (error messages output to the screen). These, and any other open files, can be redirected. Redirection simply means capturing output from a file, command, program, script, or even code block within a script (see Example 3-1 and Example 3-2) and sending it as input to another file, command, program, or script. Each open file gets assigned a file descriptor. [105] The file descriptors for stdin, stdout, and stderr are 0, 1, and 2, respectively. For opening additional files, there remain descriptors 3 to 9. It is sometimes useful to assign one of these additional file descriptors to stdin, stdout, or stderr as a temporary duplicate link. [106] This simplifies restoration to normal after complex redirection and reshuffling (see Example 20-1). COMMAND_OUTPUT &gt; # Redirect stdout to a file. # Creates the file if not present, otherwise overwrites it. ls -lR &gt; dir-tree.list # Creates a file containing a listing of the directory tree. : &gt; filename # The &gt; truncates file &quot;filename&quot; to zero length. # If file not present, creates zero-length file (same effect as 'touch'). # The : serves as a dummy placeholder, producing no output. &gt; filename # The &gt; truncates file &quot;filename&quot; to zero length. # If file not present, creates zero-length file (same effect as 'touch'). # (Same result as &quot;: &gt;&quot;, above, but this does not work with some shells.) COMMAND_OUTPUT &gt;&gt; # Redirect stdout to a file. # Creates the file if not present, otherwise appends to it. # Single-line redirection commands (affect only the line they are on): # -------------------------------------------------------------------- 1&gt;filename # Redirect stdout to file &quot;filename.&quot; 1&gt;&gt;filename # Redirect and append stdout to file &quot;filename.&quot; 2&gt;filename # Redirect stderr to file &quot;filename.&quot; 2&gt;&gt;filename # Redirect and append stderr to file &quot;filename.&quot; &amp;&gt;filename # Redirect both stdout and stderr to file &quot;filename.&quot; # This operator is now functional, as of Bash 4, final release. M&gt;N # &quot;M&quot; is a file descriptor, which defaults to 1, if not explicitly set. # &quot;N&quot; is a filename. # File descriptor &quot;M&quot; is redirect to file &quot;N.&quot; M&gt;&amp;N # &quot;M&quot; is a file descriptor, which defaults to 1, if not set. # &quot;N&quot; is another file descriptor. #============================================================================== # Redirecting stdout, one line at a time.

Multiple instances of input and output redirection and/or pipes can be combined in a single command line. command &lt; input-file &gt; output-file # Or the equivalent: &lt; input-file command &gt; output-file # Although this is non-standard. command1 | command2 | command3 &gt; output-file See Example 16-31 and Example A-14. Multiple output streams may be redirected to one file. ls -yz &gt;&gt; command.log 2&gt;&amp;1 # Capture result of illegal options &quot;yz&quot; in file &quot;command.log.&quot; # Because stderr is redirected to the file, #+ any error messages will also be there. # Note, however, that the following does *not* give the same result. ls -yz 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;&gt; command.log # Outputs an error message, but does not write to file. # More precisely, the command output (in this case, null) #+ writes to the file, but the error message goes only to stdout. # If redirecting both stdout and stderr, #+ the order of the commands makes a difference. Closing File Descriptors n&lt;&amp;- Close input file descriptor n. 0&lt;&amp;-, &lt;&amp;- Close stdin. n&gt;&amp;- Close output file descriptor n. 1&gt;&amp;-, &gt;&amp;- Close stdout. Child processes inherit open file descriptors. This is why pipes work. To prevent an fd from being inherited, close it. # Redirecting only stderr to a pipe. exec 3&gt;&amp;1 # Save current &quot;value&quot; of stdout. ls -l 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;&amp;3 3&gt;&amp;- | grep bad 3&gt;&amp;- # Close fd 3 for 'grep' (but not 'ls'). # ^^^^ ^^^^ exec 3&gt;&amp;- # Now close it for the remainder of the script. # Thanks, S.C. For a more detailed introduction to I/O redirection see Appendix F. 20.1. Using exec An exec &lt;filename command redirects stdin to a file. From that point on, all stdin comes from that file, rather than its normal source (usually keyboard input). This provides a method of reading a file line by line and possibly parsing each line of input using sed and/or awk. Example 20-1. Redirecting stdin using exec #!/bin/bash # Redirecting stdin using 'exec'. exec 6&lt;&amp;0 # Link file descriptor #6 with stdin. # Saves stdin. exec &lt; data-file # stdin replaced by file &quot;data-file&quot; read a1 # Reads first line of file &quot;data-file&quot;. read a2 # Reads second line of file &quot;data-file.&quot; echo echo &quot;Following lines read from file.&quot; echo &quot;-------------------------------&quot; echo $a1 echo $a2 echo; echo; echo exec 0&lt;&amp;6 6&lt;&amp;- # Now restore stdin from fd #6, where it had been saved, #+ and close fd #6 ( 6&lt;&amp;- ) to free it for other processes to use. # # &lt;&amp;6 6&lt;&amp;- also works. echo -n &quot;Enter data &quot; read b1 # Now &quot;read&quot; functions as expected, reading from normal stdin. echo &quot;Input read from stdin.&quot; echo &quot;----------------------&quot; echo &quot;b1 = $b1&quot; echo exit 0 Similarly, an exec &gt;filename command redirects stdout to a designated file. This sends all command output that would normally go to stdout to that file. Important exec N &gt; filename affects the entire script or current shell. Redirection in the PID of the script or shell from that point on has changed. However . . . N &gt; filename affects only the newly-forked process, not the entire script or shell. Thank you, Ahmed Darwish, for pointing this out. Example 20-2. Redirecting stdout using exec #!/bin/bash # reassign-stdout.sh LOGFILE=logfile.txt exec 6&gt;&amp;1 # Link file descriptor #6 with stdout. # Saves stdout. exec &gt; $LOGFILE # stdout replaced with file &quot;logfile.txt&quot;. # ----------------------------------------------------------- # # All output from commands in this block sent to file $LOGFILE. echo -n &quot;Logfile: &quot; date echo &quot;-------------------------------------&quot; echo echo &quot;Output of \&quot;ls -al\&quot; command&quot; echo ls -al echo; echo echo &quot;Output of \&quot;df\&quot; command&quot; echo df # ----------------------------------------------------------- # exec 1&gt;&amp;6 6&gt;&amp;- # Restore stdout and close file descriptor #6. echo echo &quot;== stdout now restored to default == &quot; echo ls -al echo exit 0 Example 20-3. Redirecting both stdin and stdout in the same script with exec #!/bin/bash # upperconv.sh # Converts a specified input file to uppercase. E_FILE_ACCESS=70 E_WRONG_ARGS=71 if [ ! -r &quot;$1&quot; ] # Is specified input file readable? then echo &quot;Can't read from input file!&quot; echo &quot;Usage: $0 input-file output-file&quot; exit $E_FILE_ACCESS fi # Will exit with same error #+ even if input file ($1) not specified (why?). if [ -z &quot;$2&quot; ] then echo &quot;Need to specify output file.&quot; echo &quot;Usage: $0 input-file output-file&quot; exit $E_WRONG_ARGS fi exec 4&lt;&amp;0 exec &lt; $1 # Will read from input file. exec 7&gt;&amp;1 exec &gt; $2 # Will write to output file. # Assumes output file writable (add check?). # ----------------------------------------------- cat - | tr a-z A-Z # Uppercase conversion. # ^^^^^ # Reads from stdin. # ^^^^^^^^^^ # Writes to stdout. # However, both stdin and stdout were redirected. # Note that the 'cat' can be omitted. # ----------------------------------------------- exec 1&gt;&amp;7 7&gt;&amp;- # Restore stout. exec 0&lt;&amp;4 4&lt;&amp;- # Restore stdin. # After restoration, the following line prints to stdout as expected. echo &quot;File \&quot;$1\&quot; written to \&quot;$2\&quot; as uppercase conversion.&quot; exit 0 I/O redirection is a clever way of avoiding the dreaded inaccessible variables within a subshell problem. Example 20-4. Avoiding a subshell #!/bin/bash # avoid-subshell.sh # Suggested by Matthew Walker. Lines=0 echo cat myfile.txt | while read line; do { echo $line (( Lines++ )); # Incremented values of this variable #+ inaccessible outside loop. # Subshell problem. } done echo &quot;Number of lines read = $Lines&quot; # 0 # Wrong! echo &quot;------------------------&quot; exec 3&lt;&gt; myfile.txt while read line &lt;&amp;3 do { echo &quot;$line&quot; (( Lines++ )); # Incremented values of this variable #+ accessible outside loop. # No subshell, no problem. } done exec 3&gt;&amp;- echo &quot;Number of lines read = $Lines&quot; # 8 echo exit 0 # Lines below not seen by script. $ cat myfile.txt Line 1. Line 2. Line 3. Line 4. Line 5. Line 6. Line 7. Line 8. 20.2. Redirecting Code Blocks Blocks of code, such as while, until, and for loops, even if/then test blocks can also incorporate redirection of stdin. Even a function may use this form of redirection (see Example 24-11). The &lt; operator at the end of the code block accomplishes this. Example 20-5. Redirected while loop #!/bin/bash # redir2.sh if [ -z &quot;$1&quot; ] then Filename=names.data # Default, if no filename specified. else Filename=$1 fi #+ Filename=${1:-names.data} # can replace the above test (parameter substitution). count=0 echo while [ &quot;$name&quot; != Smith ] # Why is variable $name in quotes? do read name # Reads from $Filename, rather than stdin. echo $name let &quot;count += 1&quot; done &lt;&quot;$Filename&quot; # Redirects stdin to file $Filename. # ^^^^^^^^^^^^ echo; echo &quot;$count names read&quot;; echo exit 0 # Note that in some older shell scripting languages, #+ the redirected loop would run as a subshell. # Therefore, $count would return 0, the initialized value outside the loop. # Bash and ksh avoid starting a subshell *whenever possible*, #+ so that this script, for example, runs correctly. # (Thanks to Heiner Steven for pointing this out.) # However . . . # Bash *can* sometimes start a subshell in a PIPED &quot;while-read&quot; loop, #+ as distinct from a REDIRECTED &quot;while&quot; loop. abc=hi echo -e &quot;1\n2\n3&quot; | while read l do abc=&quot;$l&quot; echo $abc done echo $abc # Thanks, Bruno de Oliveira Schneider, for demonstrating this #+ with the above snippet of code. # And, thanks, Brian Onn, for correcting an annotation error. Example 20-6. Alternate form of redirected while loop #!/bin/bash # This is an alternate form of the preceding script. # Suggested by Heiner Steven #+ as a workaround in those situations when a redirect loop #+ runs as a subshell, and therefore variables inside the loop # +do not keep their values upon loop termination. if [ -z &quot;$1&quot; ] then Filename=names.data # Default, if no filename specified. else Filename=$1 fi exec 3&lt;&amp;0 # Save stdin to file descriptor 3. exec 0&lt;&quot;$Filename&quot; # Redirect standard input. count=0 echo while [ &quot;$name&quot; != Smith ] do read name # Reads from redirected stdin ($Filename). echo $name let &quot;count += 1&quot; done # Loop reads from file $Filename #+ because of line 20. # The original version of this script terminated the &quot;while&quot; loop with #+ done &lt;&quot;$Filename&quot; # Exercise: # Why is this unnecessary? exec 0&lt;&amp;3 # Restore old stdin. exec 3&lt;&amp;- # Close temporary fd 3. echo; echo &quot;$count names read&quot;; echo exit 0 Example 20-7. Redirected until loop #!/bin/bash # Same as previous example, but with &quot;until&quot; loop. if [ -z &quot;$1&quot; ] then Filename=names.data # Default, if no filename specified. else Filename=$1 fi # while [ &quot;$name&quot; != Smith ] until [ &quot;$name&quot; = Smith ] # Change != to =. do read name # Reads from $Filename, rather than stdin. echo $name done &lt;&quot;$Filename&quot; # Redirects stdin to file $Filename. # ^^^^^^^^^^^^ # Same results as with &quot;while&quot; loop in previous example. exit 0 Example 20-8. Redirected for loop #!/bin/bash if [ -z &quot;$1&quot; ] then Filename=names.data # Default, if no filename specified. else Filename=$1 fi line_count=`wc $Filename | awk '{ print $1 }'` # Number of lines in target file. # # Very contrived and kludgy, nevertheless shows that #+ it's possible to redirect stdin within a &quot;for&quot; loop... #+ if you're clever enough. # # More concise is line_count=$(wc -l &lt; &quot;$Filename&quot;) for name in `seq $line_count` # Recall that &quot;seq&quot; prints sequence of numbers. # while [ &quot;$name&quot; != Smith ] -- more complicated than a &quot;while&quot; loop -- do read name # Reads from $Filename, rather than stdin. echo $name if [ &quot;$name&quot; = Smith ] # Need all this extra baggage here. then break fi done &lt;&quot;$Filename&quot; # Redirects stdin to file $Filename. # ^^^^^^^^^^^^ exit 0 We can modify the previous example to also redirect the output of the loop. Example 20-9. Redirected for loop (both stdin and stdout redirected) #!/bin/bash if [ -z &quot;$1&quot; ] then Filename=names.data # Default, if no filename specified. else Filename=$1 fi Savefile=$Filename.new # Filename to save results in.

Data file names.data for above examples Aristotle Arrhenius Belisarius Capablanca Dickens Euler Goethe Hegel Jonah Laplace Maroczy Purcell Schmidt Schopenhauer Semmelweiss Smith Steinmetz Tukhashevsky Turing Venn Warshawski Znosko-Borowski # This is a data file for #+ &quot;redir2.sh&quot;, &quot;redir3.sh&quot;, &quot;redir4.sh&quot;, &quot;redir4a.sh&quot;, &quot;redir5.sh&quot;. Redirecting the stdout of a code block has the effect of saving its output to a file. See Example 3-2. Here documents are a special case of redirected code blocks. That being the case, it should be possible to feed the output of a here document into the stdin for a while loop. # This example by Albert Siersema # Used with permission (thanks!). function doesOutput() # Could be an external command too, of course. # Here we show you can use a function as well. { ls -al *.jpg | awk '{print $5,$9}' } nr=0 # We want the while loop to be able to manipulate these and totalSize=0 #+ to be able to see the changes after the 'while' finished. while read fileSize fileName ; do echo &quot;$fileName is $fileSize bytes&quot; let nr++ totalSize=$((totalSize+fileSize)) # Or: &quot;let totalSize+=fileSize&quot; done&lt;&lt;EOF $(doesOutput) EOF echo &quot;$nr files totaling $totalSize bytes&quot; 20.3. Applications Clever use of I/O redirection permits parsing and stitching together snippets of command output (see Example 15-7). This permits generating report and log files. Example 20-12. Logging events #!/bin/bash # logevents.sh # Author: Stephane Chazelas. # Used in ABS Guide with permission. # Event logging to a file. # Must be run as root (for write access in /var/log).

Subshells Running a shell script launches a new process, a subshell. Definition: A subshell is a child process launched by a shell (or shell script). A subshell is a separate instance of the command processor -- the shell that gives you the prompt at the console or in an xterm window. Just as your commands are interpreted at the command-line prompt, similarly does a script batch-process a list of commands. Each shell script running is, in effect, a subprocess (child process) of the parent shell. A shell script can itself launch subprocesses. These subshells let the script do parallel processing, in effect executing multiple subtasks simultaneously. #!/bin/bash # subshell-test.sh ( # Inside parentheses, and therefore a subshell . . . while [ 1 ] # Endless loop. do echo &quot;Subshell running . . .&quot; done ) # Script will run forever, #+ or at least until terminated by a Ctl-C. exit $? # End of script (but will never get here). Now, run the script: sh subshell-test.sh And, while the script is running, from a different xterm: ps -ef | grep subshell-test.sh UID PID PPID C STIME TTY TIME CMD 500 2698 2502 0 14:26 pts/4 00:00:00 sh subshell-test.sh 500 2699 2698 21 14:26 pts/4 00:00:24 sh subshell-test.sh ^^^^ Analysis: PID 2698, the script, launched PID 2699, the subshell. Note: The &quot;UID ...&quot; line would be filtered out by the &quot;grep&quot; command, but is shown here for illustrative purposes. In general, an external command in a script forks off a subprocess, [107] whereas a Bash builtin does not. For this reason, builtins execute more quickly and use fewer system resources than their external command equivalents. Command List within Parentheses ( command1; command2; command3; ... ) A command list embedded between parentheses runs as a subshell. Variables in a subshell are not visible outside the block of code in the subshell. They are not accessible to the parent process, to the shell that launched the subshell. These are, in effect, variables local to the child process. Example 21-1. Variable scope in a subshell #!/bin/bash # subshell.sh echo echo &quot;We are outside the subshell.&quot; echo &quot;Subshell level OUTSIDE subshell = $BASH_SUBSHELL&quot; # Bash, version 3, adds the new $BASH_SUBSHELL variable. echo; echo outer_variable=Outer global_variable= # Define global variable for &quot;storage&quot; of #+ value of subshell variable. ( echo &quot;We are inside the subshell.&quot; echo &quot;Subshell level INSIDE subshell = $BASH_SUBSHELL&quot; inner_variable=Inner echo &quot;From inside subshell, \&quot;inner_variable\&quot; = $inner_variable&quot; echo &quot;From inside subshell, \&quot;outer\&quot; = $outer_variable&quot; global_variable=&quot;$inner_variable&quot; # Will this allow &quot;exporting&quot; #+ a subshell variable? ) echo; echo echo &quot;We are outside the subshell.&quot; echo &quot;Subshell level OUTSIDE subshell = $BASH_SUBSHELL&quot; echo if [ -z &quot;$inner_variable&quot; ] then echo &quot;inner_variable undefined in main body of shell&quot; else echo &quot;inner_variable defined in main body of shell&quot; fi echo &quot;From main body of shell, \&quot;inner_variable\&quot; = $inner_variable&quot; # $inner_variable will show as blank (uninitialized) #+ because variables defined in a subshell are &quot;local variables&quot;. # Is there a remedy for this? echo &quot;global_variable = &quot;$global_variable&quot;&quot; # Why doesn't this work? echo # ======================================================================= # Additionally ... echo &quot;-----------------&quot;; echo var=41 # Global variable. ( let &quot;var+=1&quot;; echo &quot;\$var INSIDE subshell = $var&quot; ) # 42 echo &quot;\$var OUTSIDE subshell = $var&quot; # 41 # Variable operations inside a subshell, even to a GLOBAL variable #+ do not affect the value of the variable outside the subshell! exit 0 # Question: # -------- # Once having exited a subshell, #+ is there any way to reenter that very same subshell #+ to modify or access the subshell variables? See also $BASHPID and Example 34-2. Definition: The scope of a variable is the context in which it has meaning, in which it has a value that can be referenced. For example, the scope of a local variable lies only within the function, block of code, or subshell within which it is defined, while the scope of a global variable is the entire script in which it appears. Note While the $BASH_SUBSHELL internal variable indicates the nesting level of a subshell, the $SHLVL variable shows no change within a subshell. echo &quot; \$BASH_SUBSHELL outside subshell = $BASH_SUBSHELL&quot; # 0 ( echo &quot; \$BASH_SUBSHELL inside subshell = $BASH_SUBSHELL&quot; ) # 1 ( ( echo &quot; \$BASH_SUBSHELL inside nested subshell = $BASH_SUBSHELL&quot; ) ) # 2 # ^ ^ *** nested *** ^ ^ echo echo &quot; \$SHLVL outside subshell = $SHLVL&quot; # 3 ( echo &quot; \$SHLVL inside subshell = $SHLVL&quot; ) # 3 (No change!) Directory changes made in a subshell do not carry over to the parent shell. Example 21-2. List User Profiles #!/bin/bash # allprofs.sh: Print all user profiles. # This script written by Heiner Steven, and modified by the document author. FILE=.bashrc # File containing user profile, #+ was &quot;.profile&quot; in original script. for home in `awk -F: '{print $6}' /etc/passwd` do [ -d &quot;$home&quot; ] || continue # If no home directory, go to next. [ -r &quot;$home&quot; ] || continue # If not readable, go to next. (cd $home; [ -e $FILE ] &amp;&amp; less $FILE) done # When script terminates, there is no need to 'cd' back to original directory, #+ because 'cd $home' takes place in a subshell. exit 0 A subshell may be used to set up a &quot;dedicated environment&quot; for a command group. COMMAND1 COMMAND2 COMMAND3 ( IFS=: PATH=/bin unset TERMINFO set -C shift 5 COMMAND4 COMMAND5 exit 3 # Only exits the subshell! ) # The parent shell has not been affected, and the environment is preserved. COMMAND6 COMMAND7 As seen here, the exit command only terminates the subshell in which it is running, not the parent shell or script. One application of such a &quot;dedicated environment&quot; is testing whether a variable is defined. if (set -u; : $variable) 2&gt; /dev/null then echo &quot;Variable is set.&quot; fi # Variable has been set in current script, #+ or is an an internal Bash variable, #+ or is present in environment (has been exported). # Could also be written [[ ${variable-x} != x || ${variable-y} != y ]] # or [[ ${variable-x} != x$variable ]] # or [[ ${variable+x} = x ]] # or [[ ${variable-x} != x ]] Another application is checking for a lock file: if (set -C; : &gt; lock_file) 2&gt; /dev/null then : # lock_file didn't exist: no user running the script else echo &quot;Another user is already running that script.&quot; exit 65 fi # Code snippet by Stéphane Chazelas, #+ with modifications by Paulo Marcel Coelho Aragao. + Processes may execute in parallel within different subshells. This permits breaking a complex task into subcomponents processed concurrently. Example 21-3. Running parallel processes in subshells (cat list1 list2 list3 | sort | uniq &gt; list123) &amp; (cat list4 list5 list6 | sort | uniq &gt; list456) &amp; # Merges and sorts both sets of lists simultaneously. # Running in background ensures parallel execution. # # Same effect as # cat list1 list2 list3 | sort | uniq &gt; list123 &amp; # cat list4 list5 list6 | sort | uniq &gt; list456 &amp; wait # Don't execute the next command until subshells finish. diff list123 list456 Redirecting I/O to a subshell uses the &quot;|&quot; pipe operator, as in ls -al | (command). Note A code block between curly brackets does not launch a subshell. { command1; command2; command3; . . . commandN; } var1=23 echo &quot;$var1&quot; # 23 { var1=76; } echo &quot;$var1&quot; # 76 Chapter 22. Restricted Shells Disabled commands in restricted shells . Running a script or portion of a script in restricted mode disables certain commands that would otherwise be available. This is a security measure intended to limit the privileges of the script user and to minimize possible damage from running the script. The following commands and actions are disabled: Using cd to change the working directory. Changing the values of the $PATH, $SHELL, $BASH_ENV, or $ENV environmental variables. Reading or changing the $SHELLOPTS, shell environmental options. Output redirection. Invoking commands containing one or more /'s. Invoking exec to substitute a different process for the shell. Various other commands that would enable monkeying with or attempting to subvert the script for an unintended purpose. Getting out of restricted mode within the script. Example 22-1. Running a script in restricted mode #!/bin/bash # Starting the script with &quot;#!/bin/bash -r&quot; #+ runs entire script in restricted mode. echo echo &quot;Changing directory.&quot; cd /usr/local echo &quot;Now in `pwd`&quot; echo &quot;Coming back home.&quot; cd echo &quot;Now in `pwd`&quot; echo # Everything up to here in normal, unrestricted mode. set -r # set --restricted has same effect. echo &quot;==&gt; Now in restricted mode. &lt;==&quot; echo echo echo &quot;Attempting directory change in restricted mode.&quot; cd .. echo &quot;Still in `pwd`&quot; echo echo echo &quot;\$SHELL = $SHELL&quot; echo &quot;Attempting to change shell in restricted mode.&quot; SHELL=&quot;/bin/ash&quot; echo echo &quot;\$SHELL= $SHELL&quot; echo echo echo &quot;Attempting to redirect output in restricted mode.&quot; ls -l /usr/bin &gt; bin.files ls -l bin.files # Try to list attempted file creation effort. echo exit 0 Chapter 23. Process Substitution Piping the stdout of a command into the stdin of another is a powerful technique. But, what if you need to pipe the stdout of multiple commands? This is where process substitution comes in. Process substitution feeds the output of a process (or processes) into the stdin of another process. Template Command list enclosed within parentheses &gt;(command_list) &lt;(command_list) Process substitution uses /dev/fd/&lt;n&gt; files to send the results of the process(es) within parentheses to another process. [108] Caution There is no space between the the &quot;&lt;&quot; or &quot;&gt;&quot; and the parentheses. Space there would give an error message. bash$ echo &gt;(true) /dev/fd/63 bash$ echo &lt;(true) /dev/fd/63 bash$ echo &gt;(true) &lt;(true) /dev/fd/63 /dev/fd/62 bash$ wc &lt;(cat /usr/share/dict/linux.words) 483523 483523 4992010 /dev/fd/63 bash$ grep script /usr/share/dict/linux.words | wc 262 262 3601 bash$ wc &lt;(grep script /usr/share/dict/linux.words) 262 262 3601 /dev/fd/63 Note Bash creates a pipe with two file descriptors, --fIn and fOut--. The stdin of true connects to fOut (dup2(fOut, 0)), then Bash passes a /dev/fd/fIn argument to echo. On systems lacking /dev/fd/&lt;n&gt; files, Bash may use temporary files. (Thanks, S.C.) Process substitution can compare the output of two different commands, or even the output of different options to the same command. bash$ comm &lt;(ls -l) &lt;(ls -al) total 12 -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 78 Mar 10 12:58 File0 -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 42 Mar 10 12:58 File2 -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 103 Mar 10 12:58 t2.sh total 20 drwxrwxrwx 2 bozo bozo 4096 Mar 10 18:10 . drwx------ 72 bozo bozo 4096 Mar 10 17:58 .. -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 78 Mar 10 12:58 File0 -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 42 Mar 10 12:58 File2 -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 103 Mar 10 12:58 t2.sh Process substitution can compare the contents of two directories -- to see which filenames are in one, but not the other. diff &lt;(ls $first_directory) &lt;(ls $second_directory) Some other usages and uses of process substitution: read -a list &lt; &lt;( od -Ad -w24 -t u2 /dev/urandom ) # Read a list of random numbers from /dev/urandom, #+ process with &quot;od&quot; #+ and feed into stdin of &quot;read&quot; . . . # From &quot;insertion-sort.bash&quot; example script. # Courtesy of JuanJo Ciarlante.

A reader sent in the following interesting example of process substitution. # Script fragment taken from SuSE distribution: # --------------------------------------------------------------# while read des what mask iface; do # Some commands ... done &lt; &lt;(route -n) # ^ ^ First &lt; is redirection, second is process substitution. # To test it, let's make it do something. while read des what mask iface; do echo $des $what $mask $iface done &lt; &lt;(route -n) # Output: # Kernel IP routing table # Destination Gateway Genmask Flags Metric Ref Use Iface # 127.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 U 0 0 0 lo # --------------------------------------------------------------# # As Stéphane Chazelas points out, #+ an easier-to-understand equivalent is: route -n | while read des what mask iface; do # Variables set from output of pipe. echo $des $what $mask $iface done # This yields the same output as above. # However, as Ulrich Gayer points out . . . #+ this simplified equivalent uses a subshell for the while loop, #+ and therefore the variables disappear when the pipe terminates. # --------------------------------------------------------------# # However, Filip Moritz comments that there is a subtle difference #+ between the above two examples, as the following shows. ( route -n | while read x; do ((y++)); done echo $y # $y is still unset while read x; do ((y++)); done &lt; &lt;(route -n) echo $y # $y has the number of lines of output of route -n ) More generally spoken ( : | x=x # seems to start a subshell like : | ( x=x ) # while x=x &lt; &lt;(:) # does not ) # This is useful, when parsing csv and the like. # That is, in effect, what the original SuSE code fragment does. Chapter 24. Functions Like &quot;real&quot; programming languages, Bash has functions, though in a somewhat limited implementation. A function is a subroutine, a code block that implements a set of operations, a &quot;black box&quot; that performs a specified task. Wherever there is repetitive code, when a task repeats with only slight variations in procedure, then consider using a function. function function_name { command... } or function_name () { command... } This second form will cheer the hearts of C programmers (and is more portable). As in C, the function's opening bracket may optionally appear on the second line. function_name () { command... } Note A function may be &quot;compacted&quot; into a single line. fun () { echo &quot;This is a function&quot;; echo; } # ^ ^ In this case, however, a semicolon must follow the final command in the function. fun () { echo &quot;This is a function&quot;; echo } # Error! # ^ fun2 () { echo &quot;Even a single-command function? Yes!&quot;; } # ^ Functions are called, triggered, simply by invoking their names. A function call is equivalent to a command. Example 24-1. Simple functions #!/bin/bash # ex59.sh: Exercising functions (simple). JUST_A_SECOND=1 funky () { # This is about as simple as functions get. echo &quot;This is a funky function.&quot; echo &quot;Now exiting funky function.&quot; } # Function declaration must precede call. fun () { # A somewhat more complex function. i=0 REPEATS=30 echo echo &quot;And now the fun really begins.&quot; echo sleep $JUST_A_SECOND # Hey, wait a second! while [ $i -lt $REPEATS ] do echo &quot;----------FUNCTIONS----------&gt;&quot; echo &quot;&lt;------------ARE-------------&quot; echo &quot;&lt;------------FUN------------&gt;&quot; echo let &quot;i+=1&quot; done } # Now, call the functions. funky fun exit $? The function definition must precede the first call to it. There is no method of &quot;declaring&quot; the function, as, for example, in C. f1 # Will give an error message, since function &quot;f1&quot; not yet defined. declare -f f1 # This doesn't help either. f1 # Still an error message. # However... f1 () { echo &quot;Calling function \&quot;f2\&quot; from within function \&quot;f1\&quot;.&quot; f2 } f2 () { echo &quot;Function \&quot;f2\&quot;.&quot; } f1 # Function &quot;f2&quot; is not actually called until this point, #+ although it is referenced before its definition. # This is permissible. # Thanks, S.C. Note Functions may not be empty! #!/bin/bash # empty-function.sh empty () { } exit 0 # Will not exit here! # $ sh empty-function.sh # empty-function.sh: line 6: syntax error near unexpected token `}' # empty-function.sh: line 6: `}' # $ echo $? # 2 # Note that a function containing only comments is empty. func () { # Comment 1. # Comment 2. # This is still an empty function. # Thank you, Mark Bova, for pointing this out. } # Results in same error message as above. # However ... not_quite_empty () { illegal_command } # A script containing this function will *not* bomb #+ as long as the function is not called. not_empty () { : } # Contains a : (null command), and this is okay. # Thank you, Dominick Geyer and Thiemo Kellner. It is even possible to nest a function within another function, although this is not very useful. f1 () { f2 () # nested { echo &quot;Function \&quot;f2\&quot;, inside \&quot;f1\&quot;.&quot; } } f2 # Gives an error message. # Even a preceding &quot;declare -f f2&quot; wouldn't help. echo f1 # Does nothing, since calling &quot;f1&quot; does not automatically call &quot;f2&quot;. f2 # Now, it's all right to call &quot;f2&quot;, #+ since its definition has been made visible by calling &quot;f1&quot;. # Thanks, S.C. Function declarations can appear in unlikely places, even where a command would otherwise go. ls -l | foo() { echo &quot;foo&quot;; } # Permissible, but useless. if [ &quot;$USER&quot; = bozo ] then bozo_greet () # Function definition embedded in an if/then construct. { echo &quot;Hello, Bozo.&quot; } fi bozo_greet # Works only for Bozo, and other users get an error. # Something like this might be useful in some contexts. NO_EXIT=1 # Will enable function definition below. [[ $NO_EXIT -eq 1 ]] &amp;&amp; exit() { true; } # Function definition in an &quot;and-list&quot;. # If $NO_EXIT is 1, declares &quot;exit ()&quot;. # This disables the &quot;exit&quot; builtin by aliasing it to &quot;true&quot;. exit # Invokes &quot;exit ()&quot; function, not &quot;exit&quot; builtin. # Or, similarly: filename=file1 [ -f &quot;$filename&quot; ] &amp;&amp; foo () { rm -f &quot;$filename&quot;; echo &quot;File &quot;$filename&quot; deleted.&quot;; } || foo () { echo &quot;File &quot;$filename&quot; not found.&quot;; touch bar; } foo # Thanks, S.C. and Christopher Head Function names can take strange forms. _(){ for i in {1..10}; do echo -n &quot;$FUNCNAME&quot;; done; echo; } # ^^^ No space between function name and parentheses. # This doesn't always work. Why not? # Now, let's invoke the function. _ # __________ # ^^^^^^^^^^ 10 underscores (10 x function name)! # A &quot;naked&quot; underscore is an acceptable function name. # In fact, a colon is likewise an acceptable function name. :(){ echo &quot;:&quot;; }; : # Of what use is this? # It's a devious way to obfuscate the code in a script. See also Example A-56 Note What happens when different versions of the same function appear in a script? # As Yan Chen points out, # when a function is defined multiple times, # the final version is what is invoked. # This is not, however, particularly useful. func () { echo &quot;First version of func ().&quot; } func () { echo &quot;Second version of func ().&quot; } func # Second version of func (). exit $? # It is even possible to use functions to override #+ or preempt system commands. # Of course, this is *not* advisable. 24.1. Complex Functions and Function Complexities Functions may process arguments passed to them and return an exit status to the script for further processing. function_name $arg1 $arg2 The function refers to the passed arguments by position (as if they were positional parameters), that is, $1, $2, and so forth. Example 24-2. Function Taking Parameters #!/bin/bash # Functions and parameters DEFAULT=default # Default param value. func2 () { if [ -z &quot;$1&quot; ] # Is parameter #1 zero length? then echo &quot;-Parameter #1 is zero length.-&quot; # Or no parameter passed. else echo &quot;-Parameter #1 is \&quot;$1\&quot;.-&quot; fi variable=${1-$DEFAULT} # What does echo &quot;variable = $variable&quot; #+ parameter substitution show? # --------------------------- # It distinguishes between #+ no param and a null param. if [ &quot;$2&quot; ] then echo &quot;-Parameter #2 is \&quot;$2\&quot;.-&quot; fi return 0 } echo echo &quot;Nothing passed.&quot; func2 # Called with no params echo echo &quot;Zero-length parameter passed.&quot; func2 &quot;&quot; # Called with zero-length param echo echo &quot;Null parameter passed.&quot; func2 &quot;$uninitialized_param&quot; # Called with uninitialized param echo echo &quot;One parameter passed.&quot; func2 first # Called with one param echo echo &quot;Two parameters passed.&quot; func2 first second # Called with two params echo echo &quot;\&quot;\&quot; \&quot;second\&quot; passed.&quot; func2 &quot;&quot; second # Called with zero-length first parameter echo # and ASCII string as a second one. exit 0 Important The shift command works on arguments passed to functions (see Example 36-18). But, what about command-line arguments passed to the script? Does a function see them? Well, let's clear up the confusion. Example 24-3. Functions and command-line args passed to the script #!/bin/bash # func-cmdlinearg.sh # Call this script with a command-line argument, #+ something like $0 arg1. func () { echo &quot;$1&quot; # Echoes first arg passed to the function. } # Does a command-line arg qualify? echo &quot;First call to function: no arg passed.&quot; echo &quot;See if command-line arg is seen.&quot; func # No! Command-line arg not seen. echo &quot;============================================================&quot; echo echo &quot;Second call to function: command-line arg passed explicitly.&quot; func $1 # Now it's seen! exit 0 In contrast to certain other programming languages, shell scripts normally pass only value parameters to functions. Variable names (which are actually pointers), if passed as parameters to functions, will be treated as string literals. Functions interpret their arguments literally. Indirect variable references (see Example 37-2) provide a clumsy sort of mechanism for passing variable pointers to functions. Example 24-4. Passing an indirect reference to a function #!/bin/bash # ind-func.sh: Passing an indirect reference to a function. echo_var () { echo &quot;$1&quot; } message=Hello Hello=Goodbye echo_var &quot;$message&quot; # Hello # Now, let's pass an indirect reference to the function. echo_var &quot;${!message}&quot; # Goodbye echo &quot;-------------&quot; # What happens if we change the contents of &quot;hello&quot; variable? Hello=&quot;Hello, again!&quot; echo_var &quot;$message&quot; # Hello echo_var &quot;${!message}&quot; # Hello, again! exit 0 The next logical question is whether parameters can be dereferenced after being passed to a function. Example 24-5. Dereferencing a parameter passed to a function #!/bin/bash # dereference.sh # Dereferencing parameter passed to a function. # Script by Bruce W. Clare. dereference () { y=\$&quot;$1&quot; # Name of variable (not value!). echo $y # $Junk x=`eval &quot;expr \&quot;$y\&quot; &quot;` echo $1=$x eval &quot;$1=\&quot;Some Different Text \&quot;&quot; # Assign new value. } Junk=&quot;Some Text&quot; echo $Junk &quot;before&quot; # Some Text before dereference Junk echo $Junk &quot;after&quot; # Some Different Text after exit 0 Example 24-6. Again, dereferencing a parameter passed to a function #!/bin/bash # ref-params.sh: Dereferencing a parameter passed to a function. # (Complex Example) ITERATIONS=3 # How many times to get input. icount=1 my_read () { # Called with my_read varname, #+ outputs the previous value between brackets as the default value, #+ then asks for a new value. local local_var echo -n &quot;Enter a value &quot; eval 'echo -n &quot;[$'$1'] &quot;' # Previous value. # eval echo -n &quot;[\$$1] &quot; # Easier to understand, #+ but loses trailing space in user prompt. read local_var [ -n &quot;$local_var&quot; ] &amp;&amp; eval $1=\$local_var # &quot;And-list&quot;: if &quot;local_var&quot; then set &quot;$1&quot; to its value. } echo while [ &quot;$icount&quot; -le &quot;$ITERATIONS&quot; ] do my_read var echo &quot;Entry #$icount = $var&quot; let &quot;icount += 1&quot; echo done # Thanks to Stephane Chazelas for providing this instructive example. exit 0 Exit and Return exit status Functions return a value, called an exit status. This is analogous to the exit status returned by a command. The exit status may be explicitly specified by a return statement, otherwise it is the exit status of the last command in the function (0 if successful, and a non-zero error code if not). This exit status may be used in the script by referencing it as $?. This mechanism effectively permits script functions to have a &quot;return value&quot; similar to C functions. return Terminates a function. A return command [109] optionally takes an integer argument, which is returned to the calling script as the &quot;exit status&quot; of the function, and this exit status is assigned to the variable $?. Example 24-7. Maximum of two numbers #!/bin/bash # max.sh: Maximum of two integers. E_PARAM_ERR=250 # If less than 2 params passed to function. EQUAL=251 # Return value if both params equal. # Error values out of range of any #+ params that might be fed to the function. max2 () # Returns larger of two numbers. { # Note: numbers compared must be less than 250. if [ -z &quot;$2&quot; ] then return $E_PARAM_ERR fi if [ &quot;$1&quot; -eq &quot;$2&quot; ] then return $EQUAL else if [ &quot;$1&quot; -gt &quot;$2&quot; ] then return $1 else return $2 fi fi } max2 33 34 return_val=$? if [ &quot;$return_val&quot; -eq $E_PARAM_ERR ] then echo &quot;Need to pass two parameters to the function.&quot; elif [ &quot;$return_val&quot; -eq $EQUAL ] then echo &quot;The two numbers are equal.&quot; else echo &quot;The larger of the two numbers is $return_val.&quot; fi exit 0 # Exercise (easy): # --------------- # Convert this to an interactive script, #+ that is, have the script ask for input (two numbers). Tip For a function to return a string or array, use a dedicated variable. count_lines_in_etc_passwd() { [[ -r /etc/passwd ]] &amp;&amp; REPLY=$(echo $(wc -l &lt; /etc/passwd)) # If /etc/passwd is readable, set REPLY to line count. # Returns both a parameter value and status information. # The 'echo' seems unnecessary, but . . . #+ it removes excess whitespace from the output. } if count_lines_in_etc_passwd then echo &quot;There are $REPLY lines in /etc/passwd.&quot; else echo &quot;Cannot count lines in /etc/passwd.&quot; fi # Thanks, S.C. Example 24-8. Converting numbers to Roman numerals #!/bin/bash # Arabic number to Roman numeral conversion # Range: 0 - 200 # It's crude, but it works. # Extending the range and otherwise improving the script is left as an exercise. # Usage: roman number-to-convert LIMIT=200 E_ARG_ERR=65 E_OUT_OF_RANGE=66 if [ -z &quot;$1&quot; ] then echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` number-to-convert&quot; exit $E_ARG_ERR fi num=$1 if [ &quot;$num&quot; -gt $LIMIT ] then echo &quot;Out of range!&quot; exit $E_OUT_OF_RANGE fi to_roman () # Must declare function before first call to it. { number=$1 factor=$2 rchar=$3 let &quot;remainder = number - factor&quot; while [ &quot;$remainder&quot; -ge 0 ] do echo -n $rchar let &quot;number -= factor&quot; let &quot;remainder = number - factor&quot; done return $number # Exercises: # --------- # 1) Explain how this function works. # Hint: division by successive subtraction. # 2) Extend to range of the function. # Hint: use &quot;echo&quot; and command-substitution capture. } to_roman $num 100 C num=$? to_roman $num 90 LXXXX num=$? to_roman $num 50 L num=$? to_roman $num 40 XL num=$? to_roman $num 10 X num=$? to_roman $num 9 IX num=$? to_roman $num 5 V num=$? to_roman $num 4 IV num=$? to_roman $num 1 I # Successive calls to conversion function! # Is this really necessary??? Can it be simplified? echo exit See also Example 11-29. Important The largest positive integer a function can return is 255. The return command is closely tied to the concept of exit status, which accounts for this particular limitation. Fortunately, there are various workarounds for those situations requiring a large integer return value from a function. Example 24-9. Testing large return values in a function #!/bin/bash # return-test.sh # The largest positive value a function can return is 255. return_test () # Returns whatever passed to it. { return $1 } return_test 27 # o.k. echo $? # Returns 27. return_test 255 # Still o.k. echo $? # Returns 255. return_test 257 # Error! echo $? # Returns 1 (return code for miscellaneous error). # ========================================================= return_test -151896 # Do large negative numbers work? echo $? # Will this return -151896? # No! It returns 168. # Version of Bash before 2.05b permitted #+ large negative integer return values. # It happened to be a useful feature. # Newer versions of Bash unfortunately plug this loophole. # This may break older scripts. # Caution! # ========================================================= exit 0 A workaround for obtaining large integer &quot;return values&quot; is to simply assign the &quot;return value&quot; to a global variable. Return_Val= # Global variable to hold oversize return value of function. alt_return_test () { fvar=$1 Return_Val=$fvar return # Returns 0 (success). } alt_return_test 1 echo $? # 0 echo &quot;return value = $Return_Val&quot; # 1 alt_return_test 256 echo &quot;return value = $Return_Val&quot; # 256 alt_return_test 257 echo &quot;return value = $Return_Val&quot; # 257 alt_return_test 25701 echo &quot;return value = $Return_Val&quot; #25701 A more elegant method is to have the function echo its &quot;return value to stdout,&quot; and then capture it by command substitution. See the discussion of this in Section 36.7. Example 24-10. Comparing two large integers #!/bin/bash # max2.sh: Maximum of two LARGE integers. # This is the previous &quot;max.sh&quot; example, #+ modified to permit comparing large integers. EQUAL=0 # Return value if both params equal. E_PARAM_ERR=-99999 # Not enough params passed to function. # ^^^^^^ Out of range of any params that might be passed. max2 () # &quot;Returns&quot; larger of two numbers. { if [ -z &quot;$2&quot; ] then echo $E_PARAM_ERR return fi if [ &quot;$1&quot; -eq &quot;$2&quot; ] then echo $EQUAL return else if [ &quot;$1&quot; -gt &quot;$2&quot; ] then retval=$1 else retval=$2 fi fi echo $retval # Echoes (to stdout), rather than returning value. # Why? } return_val=$(max2 33001 33997) # ^^^^ Function name # ^^^^^ ^^^^^ Params passed # This is actually a form of command substitution: #+ treating a function as if it were a command, #+ and assigning the stdout of the function to the variable &quot;return_val.&quot; # ========================= OUTPUT ======================== if [ &quot;$return_val&quot; -eq &quot;$E_PARAM_ERR&quot; ] then echo &quot;Error in parameters passed to comparison function!&quot; elif [ &quot;$return_val&quot; -eq &quot;$EQUAL&quot; ] then echo &quot;The two numbers are equal.&quot; else echo &quot;The larger of the two numbers is $return_val.&quot; fi # ========================================================= exit 0 # Exercises: # --------- # 1) Find a more elegant way of testing #+ the parameters passed to the function. # 2) Simplify the if/then structure at &quot;OUTPUT.&quot; # 3) Rewrite the script to take input from command-line parameters. Here is another example of capturing a function &quot;return value.&quot; Understanding it requires some knowledge of awk. month_length () # Takes month number as an argument. { # Returns number of days in month. monthD=&quot;31 28 31 30 31 30 31 31 30 31 30 31&quot; # Declare as local? echo &quot;$monthD&quot; | awk '{ print $'&quot;${1}&quot;' }' # Tricky. # ^^^^^^^^^ # Parameter passed to function ($1 -- month number), then to awk. # Awk sees this as &quot;print $1 . . . print $12&quot; (depending on month number) # Template for passing a parameter to embedded awk script: # $'&quot;${script_parameter}&quot;' # Here's a slightly simpler awk construct: # echo $monthD | awk -v month=$1 '{print $(month)}' # Uses the -v awk option, which assigns a variable value #+ prior to execution of the awk program block. # Thank you, Rich. # Needs error checking for correct parameter range (1-12) #+ and for February in leap year. } # ---------------------------------------------- # Usage example: month=4 # April, for example (4th month). days_in=$(month_length $month) echo $days_in # 30 # ---------------------------------------------- See also Example A-7 and Example A-37. Exercise: Using what we have just learned, extend the previous Roman numerals example to accept arbitrarily large input. Redirection Redirecting the stdin of a function A function is essentially a code block, which means its stdin can be redirected (as in Example 3-1). Example 24-11. Real name from username #!/bin/bash # realname.sh # # From username, gets &quot;real name&quot; from /etc/passwd. ARGCOUNT=1 # Expect one arg. E_WRONGARGS=85 file=/etc/passwd pattern=$1 if [ $# -ne &quot;$ARGCOUNT&quot; ] then echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` USERNAME&quot; exit $E_WRONGARGS fi file_excerpt () # Scan file for pattern, { #+ then print relevant portion of line. while read line # &quot;while&quot; does not necessarily need [ condition ] do echo &quot;$line&quot; | grep $1 | awk -F&quot;:&quot; '{ print $5 }' # Have awk use &quot;:&quot; delimiter. done } &lt;$file # Redirect into function's stdin. file_excerpt $pattern # Yes, this entire script could be reduced to # grep PATTERN /etc/passwd | awk -F&quot;:&quot; '{ print $5 }' # or # awk -F: '/PATTERN/ {print $5}' # or # awk -F: '($1 == &quot;username&quot;) { print $5 }' # real name from username # However, it might not be as instructive. exit 0 There is an alternate, and perhaps less confusing method of redirecting a function's stdin. This involves redirecting the stdin to an embedded bracketed code block within the function. # Instead of: Function () { ... } &lt; file # Try this: Function () { { ... } &lt; file } # Similarly, Function () # This works. { { echo $* } | tr a b } Function () # This doesn't work. { echo $* } | tr a b # A nested code block is mandatory here. # Thanks, S.C. Note Emmanuel Rouat's sample bashrc file contains some instructive examples of functions. 24.2. Local Variables What makes a variable local? local variables A variable declared as local is one that is visible only within the block of code in which it appears. It has local scope. In a function, a local variable has meaning only within that function block. [110] Example 24-12. Local variable visibility #!/bin/bash # ex62.sh: Global and local variables inside a function. func () { local loc_var=23 # Declared as local variable. echo # Uses the 'local' builtin. echo &quot;\&quot;loc_var\&quot; in function = $loc_var&quot; global_var=999 # Not declared as local. # Therefore, defaults to global. echo &quot;\&quot;global_var\&quot; in function = $global_var&quot; } func # Now, to see if local variable &quot;loc_var&quot; exists outside the function. echo echo &quot;\&quot;loc_var\&quot; outside function = $loc_var&quot; # $loc_var outside function = # No, $loc_var not visible globally. echo &quot;\&quot;global_var\&quot; outside function = $global_var&quot; # $global_var outside function = 999 # $global_var is visible globally. echo exit 0 # In contrast to C, a Bash variable declared inside a function #+ is local ONLY if declared as such. Caution Before a function is called, all variables declared within the function are invisible outside the body of the function, not just those explicitly declared as local. #!/bin/bash func () { global_var=37 # Visible only within the function block #+ before the function has been called. } # END OF FUNCTION echo &quot;global_var = $global_var&quot; # global_var = # Function &quot;func&quot; has not yet been called, #+ so $global_var is not visible here. func echo &quot;global_var = $global_var&quot; # global_var = 37 # Has been set by function call. Note As Evgeniy Ivanov points out, when declaring and setting a local variable in a single command, apparently the order of operations is to first set the variable, and only afterwards restrict it to local scope. This is reflected in the return value. #!/bin/bash echo &quot;==OUTSIDE Function (global)==&quot; t=$(exit 1) echo $? # 1 # As expected. echo function0 () { echo &quot;==INSIDE Function==&quot; echo &quot;Global&quot; t0=$(exit 1) echo $? # 1 # As expected. echo echo &quot;Local declared &amp; assigned in same command.&quot; local t1=$(exit 1) echo $? # 0 # Unexpected! # Apparently, the variable assignment takes place before #+ the local declaration. #+ The return value is for the latter. echo echo &quot;Local declared, then assigned (separate commands).&quot; local t2 t2=$(exit 1) echo $? # 1 # As expected. } function0 24.2.1. Local variables and recursion. Recursion is an interesting and sometimes useful form of self-reference. Herbert Mayer defines it as &quot;. . . expressing an algorithm by using a simpler version of that same algorithm . . .&quot; Consider a definition defined in terms of itself, [111] an expression implicit in its own expression, [112] a snake swallowing its own tail, [113] or . . . a function that calls itself. [114] Example 24-13. Demonstration of a simple recursive function #!/bin/bash # recursion-demo.sh # Demonstration of recursion. RECURSIONS=9 # How many times to recurse. r_count=0 # Must be global. Why? recurse () { var=&quot;$1&quot; while [ &quot;$var&quot; -ge 0 ] do echo &quot;Recursion count = &quot;$r_count&quot; +-+ \$var = &quot;$var&quot;&quot; (( var-- )); (( r_count++ )) recurse &quot;$var&quot; # Function calls itself (recurses) done #+ until what condition is met? } recurse $RECURSIONS exit $? Example 24-14. Another simple demonstration #!/bin/bash # recursion-def.sh # A script that defines &quot;recursion&quot; in a rather graphic way. RECURSIONS=10 r_count=0 sp=&quot; &quot; define_recursion () { ((r_count++)) sp=&quot;$sp&quot;&quot; &quot; echo -n &quot;$sp&quot; echo &quot;\&quot;The act of recurring ... \&quot;&quot; # Per 1913 Webster's dictionary. while [ $r_count -le $RECURSIONS ] do define_recursion done } echo echo &quot;Recursion: &quot; define_recursion echo exit $? Local variables are a useful tool for writing recursive code, but this practice generally involves a great deal of computational overhead and is definitely not recommended in a shell script. [115] Example 24-15. Recursion, using a local variable #!/bin/bash # factorial # --------- # Does bash permit recursion? # Well, yes, but... # It's so slow that you gotta have rocks in your head to try it. MAX_ARG=5 E_WRONG_ARGS=85 E_RANGE_ERR=86 if [ -z &quot;$1&quot; ] then echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` number&quot; exit $E_WRONG_ARGS fi if [ &quot;$1&quot; -gt $MAX_ARG ] then echo &quot;Out of range ($MAX_ARG is maximum).&quot; # Let's get real now. # If you want greater range than this, #+ rewrite it in a Real Programming Language. exit $E_RANGE_ERR fi fact () { local number=$1 # Variable &quot;number&quot; must be declared as local, #+ otherwise this doesn't work. if [ &quot;$number&quot; -eq 0 ] then factorial=1 # Factorial of 0 = 1. else let &quot;decrnum = number - 1&quot; fact $decrnum # Recursive function call (the function calls itself). let &quot;factorial = $number * $?&quot; fi return $factorial } fact $1 echo &quot;Factorial of $1 is $?.&quot; exit 0 Also see Example A-15 for an example of recursion in a script. Be aware that recursion is resource-intensive and executes slowly, and is therefore generally not appropriate in a script. 24.3. Recursion Without Local Variables A function may recursively call itself even without use of local variables. Example 24-16. The Fibonacci Sequence #!/bin/bash # fibo.sh : Fibonacci sequence (recursive) # Author: M. Cooper # License: GPL3 # ----------algorithm-------------- # Fibo(0) = 0 # Fibo(1) = 1 # else # Fibo(j) = Fibo(j-1) + Fibo(j-2) # --------------------------------- MAXTERM=15 # Number of terms (+1) to generate. MINIDX=2 # If idx is less than 2, then Fibo(idx) = idx. Fibonacci () { idx=$1 # Doesn't need to be local. Why not? if [ &quot;$idx&quot; -lt &quot;$MINIDX&quot; ] then echo &quot;$idx&quot; # First two terms are 0 1 ... see above. else (( --idx )) # j-1 term1=$( Fibonacci $idx ) # Fibo(j-1) (( --idx )) # j-2 term2=$( Fibonacci $idx ) # Fibo(j-2) echo $(( term1 + term2 )) fi # An ugly, ugly kludge. # The more elegant implementation of recursive fibo in C #+ is a straightforward translation of the algorithm in lines 7 - 10. } for i in $(seq 0 $MAXTERM) do # Calculate $MAXTERM+1 terms. FIBO=$(Fibonacci $i) echo -n &quot;$FIBO &quot; done # 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 # Takes a while, doesn't it? Recursion in a script is slow. echo exit 0 Example 24-17.

Aliases A Bash alias is essentially nothing more than a keyboard shortcut, an abbreviation, a means of avoiding typing a long command sequence. If, for example, we include alias lm=&quot;ls -l | more&quot; in the ~/.bashrc file, then each lm [116] typed at the command-line will automatically be replaced by a ls -l | more. This can save a great deal of typing at the command-line and avoid having to remember complex combinations of commands and options. Setting alias rm=&quot;rm -i&quot; (interactive mode delete) may save a good deal of grief, since it can prevent inadvertently deleting important files. In a script, aliases have very limited usefulness. It would be nice if aliases could assume some of the functionality of the C preprocessor, such as macro expansion, but unfortunately Bash does not expand arguments within the alias body. [117] Moreover, a script fails to expand an alias itself within &quot;compound constructs,&quot; such as if/then statements, loops, and functions. An added limitation is that an alias will not expand recursively. Almost invariably, whatever we would like an alias to do could be accomplished much more effectively with a function. Example 25-1. Aliases within a script #!/bin/bash # alias.sh shopt -s expand_aliases # Must set this option, else script will not expand aliases. # First, some fun. alias Jesse_James='echo &quot;\&quot;Alias Jesse James\&quot; was a 1959 comedy starring Bob Hope.&quot;' Jesse_James echo; echo; echo; alias ll=&quot;ls -l&quot; # May use either single (') or double (&quot;) quotes to define an alias. echo &quot;Trying aliased \&quot;ll\&quot;:&quot; ll /usr/X11R6/bin/mk* #* Alias works. echo directory=/usr/X11R6/bin/ prefix=mk* # See if wild card causes problems. echo &quot;Variables \&quot;directory\&quot; + \&quot;prefix\&quot; = $directory$prefix&quot; echo alias lll=&quot;ls -l $directory$prefix&quot; echo &quot;Trying aliased \&quot;lll\&quot;:&quot; lll # Long listing of all files in /usr/X11R6/bin stating with mk. # An alias can handle concatenated variables -- including wild card -- o.k. TRUE=1 echo if [ TRUE ] then alias rr=&quot;ls -l&quot; echo &quot;Trying aliased \&quot;rr\&quot; within if/then statement:&quot; rr /usr/X11R6/bin/mk* #* Error message results! # Aliases not expanded within compound statements. echo &quot;However, previously expanded alias still recognized:&quot; ll /usr/X11R6/bin/mk* fi echo count=0 while [ $count -lt 3 ] do alias rrr=&quot;ls -l&quot; echo &quot;Trying aliased \&quot;rrr\&quot; within \&quot;while\&quot; loop:&quot; rrr /usr/X11R6/bin/mk* #* Alias will not expand here either. # alias.sh: line 57: rrr: command not found let count+=1 done echo; echo alias xyz='cat $0' # Script lists itself. # Note strong quotes. xyz # This seems to work, #+ although the Bash documentation suggests that it shouldn't. # # However, as Steve Jacobson points out, #+ the &quot;$0&quot; parameter expands immediately upon declaration of the alias. exit 0 The unalias command removes a previously set alias. Example 25-2. unalias: Setting and unsetting an alias #!/bin/bash # unalias.sh shopt -s expand_aliases # Enables alias expansion. alias llm='ls -al | more' llm echo unalias llm # Unset alias. llm # Error message results, since 'llm' no longer recognized. exit 0 bash$ ./unalias.sh total 6 drwxrwxr-x 2 bozo bozo 3072 Feb 6 14:04 . drwxr-xr-x 40 bozo bozo 2048 Feb 6 14:04 .. -rwxr-xr-x 1 bozo bozo 199 Feb 6 14:04 unalias.sh ./unalias.sh: llm: command not found Chapter 26. List Constructs The and list and or list constructs provide a means of processing a number of commands consecutively. These can effectively replace complex nested if/then or even case statements. Chaining together commands and list command-1 &amp;&amp; command-2 &amp;&amp; command-3 &amp;&amp; ... command-n Each command executes in turn, provided that the previous command has given a return value of true (zero). At the first false (non-zero) return, the command chain terminates (the first command returning false is the last one to execute). An interesting use of a two-condition and list from an early version of YongYe's Tetris game script: equation() { # core algorithm used for doubling and halving the coordinates [[ ${cdx} ]] &amp;&amp; ((y=cy+(ccy-cdy)${2}2)) eval ${1}+=\&quot;${x} ${y} \&quot; } Example 26-1. Using an and list to test for command-line arguments #!/bin/bash # and list if [ ! -z &quot;$1&quot; ] &amp;&amp; echo &quot;Argument #1 = $1&quot; &amp;&amp; [ ! -z &quot;$2&quot; ] &amp;&amp; \ # ^^ ^^ ^^ echo &quot;Argument #2 = $2&quot; then echo &quot;At least 2 arguments passed to script.&quot; # All the chained commands return true. else echo &quot;Fewer than 2 arguments passed to script.&quot; # At least one of the chained commands returns false. fi # Note that &quot;if [ ! -z $1 ]&quot; works, but its alleged equivalent, # &quot;if [ -n $1 ]&quot; does not. # However, quoting fixes this. # if &quot;[ -n &quot;$1&quot; ]&quot; works. # ^ ^ Careful! # It is always best to QUOTE the variables being tested. # This accomplishes the same thing, using &quot;pure&quot; if/then statements. if [ ! -z &quot;$1&quot; ] then echo &quot;Argument #1 = $1&quot; fi if [ ! -z &quot;$2&quot; ] then echo &quot;Argument #2 = $2&quot; echo &quot;At least 2 arguments passed to script.&quot; else echo &quot;Fewer than 2 arguments passed to script.&quot; fi # It's longer and more ponderous than using an &quot;and list&quot;. exit $? Example 26-2. Another command-line arg test using an and list #!/bin/bash ARGS=1 # Number of arguments expected. E_BADARGS=85 # Exit value if incorrect number of args passed. test $# -ne $ARGS &amp;&amp; \ # ^^^^^^^^^^^^ condition #1 echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` $ARGS argument(s)&quot; &amp;&amp; exit $E_BADARGS # ^^ # If condition #1 tests true (wrong number of args passed to script), #+ then the rest of the line executes, and script terminates. # Line below executes only if the above test fails. echo &quot;Correct number of arguments passed to this script.&quot; exit 0 # To check exit value, do a &quot;echo $?&quot; after script termination. Of course, an and list can also set variables to a default value. arg1=$@ &amp;&amp; [ -z &quot;$arg1&quot; ] &amp;&amp; arg1=DEFAULT # Set $arg1 to command-line arguments, if any. # But . . . set to DEFAULT if not specified on command-line. or list command-1 || command-2 || command-3 || ... command-n Each command executes in turn for as long as the previous command returns false. At the first true return, the command chain terminates (the first command returning true is the last one to execute). This is obviously the inverse of the &quot;and list&quot;. Example 26-3. Using or lists in combination with an and list #!/bin/bash # delete.sh, a not-so-cunning file deletion utility. # Usage: delete filename E_BADARGS=85 if [ -z &quot;$1&quot; ] then echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` filename&quot; exit $E_BADARGS # No arg? Bail out. else file=$1 # Set filename. fi [ ! -f &quot;$file&quot; ] &amp;&amp; echo &quot;File \&quot;$file\&quot; not found. \ Cowardly refusing to delete a nonexistent file.&quot; # AND LIST, to give error message if file not present. # Note echo message continuing on to a second line after an escape. [ ! -f &quot;$file&quot; ] || (rm -f $file; echo &quot;File \&quot;$file\&quot; deleted.&quot;) # OR LIST, to delete file if present. # Note logic inversion above. # AND LIST executes on true, OR LIST on false. exit $? Caution If the first command in an or list returns true, it will execute. # ==&gt; The following snippets from the /etc/rc.d/init.d/single #+==&gt; script by Miquel van Smoorenburg #+==&gt; illustrate use of &quot;and&quot; and &quot;or&quot; lists. # ==&gt; &quot;Arrowed&quot; comments added by document author.

Important The exit status of an and list or an or list is the exit status of the last command executed. Clever combinations of and and or lists are possible, but the logic may easily become convoluted and require close attention to operator precedence rules, and possibly extensive debugging. false &amp;&amp; true || echo false # false # Same result as ( false &amp;&amp; true ) || echo false # false # But NOT false &amp;&amp; ( true || echo false ) # (nothing echoed) # Note left-to-right grouping and evaluation of statements. # It's usually best to avoid such complexities. # Thanks, S.C. See Example A-7 and Example 7-4 for illustrations of using and / or list constructs to test variables. Chapter 27. Arrays Newer versions of Bash support one-dimensional arrays. Array elements may be initialized with the variable[xx] notation. Alternatively, a script may introduce the entire array by an explicit declare -a variable statement. To dereference (retrieve the contents of) an array element, use curly bracket notation, that is, ${element[xx]}. Example 27-1. Simple array usage #!/bin/bash area[11]=23 area[13]=37 area[51]=UFOs # Array members need not be consecutive or contiguous. # Some members of the array can be left uninitialized. # Gaps in the array are okay. # In fact, arrays with sparse data (&quot;sparse arrays&quot;) #+ are useful in spreadsheet-processing software. echo -n &quot;area[11] = &quot; echo ${area[11]} # {curly brackets} needed. echo -n &quot;area[13] = &quot; echo ${area[13]} echo &quot;Contents of area[51] are ${area[51]}.&quot; # Contents of uninitialized array variable print blank (null variable). echo -n &quot;area[43] = &quot; echo ${area[43]} echo &quot;(area[43] unassigned)&quot; echo # Sum of two array variables assigned to third area[5]=`expr ${area[11]} + ${area[13]}` echo &quot;area[5] = area[11] + area[13]&quot; echo -n &quot;area[5] = &quot; echo ${area[5]} area[6]=`expr ${area[11]} + ${area[51]}` echo &quot;area[6] = area[11] + area[51]&quot; echo -n &quot;area[6] = &quot; echo ${area[6]} # This fails because adding an integer to a string is not permitted. echo; echo; echo # ----------------------------------------------------------------- # Another array, &quot;area2&quot;. # Another way of assigning array variables... # array_name=( XXX YYY ZZZ ... ) area2=( zero one two three four ) echo -n &quot;area2[0] = &quot; echo ${area2[0]} # Aha, zero-based indexing (first element of array is [0], not [1]). echo -n &quot;area2[1] = &quot; echo ${area2[1]} # [1] is second element of array. # ----------------------------------------------------------------- echo; echo; echo # ----------------------------------------------- # Yet another array, &quot;area3&quot;. # Yet another way of assigning array variables... # array_name=([xx]=XXX [yy]=YYY ...) area3=([17]=seventeen [24]=twenty-four) echo -n &quot;area3[17] = &quot; echo ${area3[17]} echo -n &quot;area3[24] = &quot; echo ${area3[24]} # ----------------------------------------------- exit 0 As we have seen, a convenient way of initializing an entire array is the array=( element1 element2 ... elementN ) notation. base64_charset=( {A..Z} {a..z} {0..9} + / = ) # Using extended brace expansion #+ to initialize the elements of the array. # Excerpted from vladz's &quot;base64.sh&quot; script #+ in the &quot;Contributed Scripts&quot; appendix. Bash permits array operations on variables, even if the variables are not explicitly declared as arrays. string=abcABC123ABCabc echo ${string[@]} # abcABC123ABCabc echo ${string[*]} # abcABC123ABCabc echo ${string[0]} # abcABC123ABCabc echo ${string[1]} # No output! # Why? echo ${#string[@]} # 1 # One element in the array. # The string itself. # Thank you, Michael Zick, for pointing this out. Once again this demonstrates that Bash variables are untyped. Example 27-2. Formatting a poem #!/bin/bash # poem.sh: Pretty-prints one of the ABS Guide author's favorite poems. # Lines of the poem (single stanza). Line[1]=&quot;I do not know which to prefer,&quot; Line[2]=&quot;The beauty of inflections&quot; Line[3]=&quot;Or the beauty of innuendoes,&quot; Line[4]=&quot;The blackbird whistling&quot; Line[5]=&quot;Or just after.&quot; # Note that quoting permits embedding whitespace. # Attribution.

Array variables have a syntax all their own, and even standard Bash commands and operators have special options adapted for array use. Example 27-3. Various array operations #!/bin/bash # array-ops.sh: More fun with arrays. array=( zero one two three four five ) # Element 0 1 2 3 4 5 echo ${array[0]} # zero echo ${array:0} # zero # Parameter expansion of first element, #+ starting at position # 0 (1st character). echo ${array:1} # ero # Parameter expansion of first element, #+ starting at position # 1 (2nd character). echo &quot;--------------&quot; echo ${#array[0]} # 4 # Length of first element of array. echo ${#array} # 4 # Length of first element of array. # (Alternate notation) echo ${#array[1]} # 3 # Length of second element of array. # Arrays in Bash have zero-based indexing. echo ${#array[*]} # 6 # Number of elements in array. echo ${#array[@]} # 6 # Number of elements in array. echo &quot;--------------&quot; array2=( [0]=&quot;first element&quot; [1]=&quot;second element&quot; [3]=&quot;fourth element&quot; ) # ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ # Quoting permits embedding whitespace within individual array elements. echo ${array2[0]} # first element echo ${array2[1]} # second element echo ${array2[2]} # # Skipped in initialization, and therefore null. echo ${array2[3]} # fourth element echo ${#array2[0]} # 13 (length of first element) echo ${#array2[*]} # 3 (number of elements in array) exit Many of the standard string operations work on arrays. Example 27-4. String operations on arrays #!/bin/bash # array-strops.sh: String operations on arrays. # Script by Michael Zick. # Used in ABS Guide with permission. # Fixups: 05 May 08, 04 Aug 08. # In general, any string operation using the ${name ... } notation #+ can be applied to all string elements in an array, #+ with the ${name[@] ... } or ${name[*] ...} notation. arrayZ=( one two three four five five ) echo # Trailing Substring Extraction echo ${arrayZ[@]:0} # one two three four five five # ^ All elements. echo ${arrayZ[@]:1} # two three four five five # ^ All elements following element[0]. echo ${arrayZ[@]:1:2} # two three # ^ Only the two elements after element[0]. echo &quot;---------&quot; # Substring Removal # Removes shortest match from front of string(s). echo ${arrayZ[@]#f*r} # one two three five five # ^ # Applied to all elements of the array. # Matches &quot;four&quot; and removes it. # Longest match from front of string(s) echo ${arrayZ[@]##t*e} # one two four five five # ^^ # Applied to all elements of the array. # Matches &quot;three&quot; and removes it. # Shortest match from back of string(s) echo ${arrayZ[@]%h*e} # one two t four five five # ^ # Applied to all elements of the array. # Matches &quot;hree&quot; and removes it. # Longest match from back of string(s) echo ${arrayZ[@]%%t*e} # one two four five five # ^^ # Applied to all elements of the array. # Matches &quot;three&quot; and removes it. echo &quot;----------------------&quot; # Substring Replacement # Replace first occurrence of substring with replacement. echo ${arrayZ[@]/fiv/XYZ} # one two three four XYZe XYZe # ^ # Applied to all elements of the array. # Replace all occurrences of substring. echo ${arrayZ[@]//iv/YY} # one two three four fYYe fYYe # Applied to all elements of the array. # Delete all occurrences of substring. # Not specifing a replacement defaults to 'delete' ... echo ${arrayZ[@]//fi/} # one two three four ve ve # ^^ # Applied to all elements of the array. # Replace front-end occurrences of substring. echo ${arrayZ[@]/#fi/XY} # one two three four XYve XYve # ^ # Applied to all elements of the array. # Replace back-end occurrences of substring. echo ${arrayZ[@]/%ve/ZZ} # one two three four fiZZ fiZZ # ^ # Applied to all elements of the array. echo ${arrayZ[@]/%o/XX} # one twXX three four five five # ^ # Why? echo &quot;-----------------------------&quot; replacement() { echo -n &quot;!!!&quot; } echo ${arrayZ[@]/%e/$(replacement)} # ^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ # on!!! two thre!!! four fiv!!! fiv!!! # The stdout of replacement() is the replacement string. # Q.E.D: The replacement action is, in effect, an 'assignment.' echo &quot;------------------------------------&quot; # Accessing the &quot;for-each&quot;: echo ${arrayZ[@]//*/$(replacement optional_arguments)} # ^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ # !!! !!! !!! !!! !!! !!! # Now, if Bash would only pass the matched string #+ to the function being called . . . echo exit 0 # Before reaching for a Big Hammer -- Perl, Python, or all the rest -- # recall: # $( ... ) is command substitution. # A function runs as a sub-process. # A function writes its output (if echo-ed) to stdout. # Assignment, in conjunction with &quot;echo&quot; and command substitution, #+ can read a function's stdout. # The name[@] notation specifies (the equivalent of) a &quot;for-each&quot; #+ operation. # Bash is more powerful than you think! Command substitution can construct the individual elements of an array. Example 27-5. Loading the contents of a script into an array #!/bin/bash # script-array.sh: Loads this script into an array. # Inspired by an e-mail from Chris Martin (thanks!). script_contents=( $(cat &quot;$0&quot;) ) # Stores contents of this script ($0) #+ in an array. for element in $(seq 0 $((${#script_contents[@]} - 1))) do # ${#script_contents[@]} #+ gives number of elements in the array. # # Question: # Why is seq 0 necessary? # Try changing it to seq 1. echo -n &quot;${script_contents[$element]}&quot; # List each field of this script on a single line. # echo -n &quot;${script_contents[element]}&quot; also works because of ${ ... }. echo -n &quot; -- &quot; # Use &quot; -- &quot; as a field separator. done echo exit 0 # Exercise: # -------- # Modify this script so it lists itself #+ in its original format, #+ complete with whitespace, line breaks, etc. In an array context, some Bash builtins have a slightly altered meaning. For example, unset deletes array elements, or even an entire array. Example 27-6. Some special properties of arrays #!/bin/bash declare -a colors # All subsequent commands in this script will treat #+ the variable &quot;colors&quot; as an array. echo &quot;Enter your favorite colors (separated from each other by a space).&quot; read -a colors # Enter at least 3 colors to demonstrate features below. # Special option to 'read' command, #+ allowing assignment of elements in an array. echo element_count=${#colors[@]} # Special syntax to extract number of elements in array. # element_count=${#colors[*]} works also. # # The &quot;@&quot; variable allows word splitting within quotes #+ (extracts variables separated by whitespace). # # This corresponds to the behavior of &quot;$@&quot; and &quot;$*&quot; #+ in positional parameters. index=0 while [ &quot;$index&quot; -lt &quot;$element_count&quot; ] do # List all the elements in the array. echo ${colors[$index]} # ${colors[index]} also works because it's within ${ ... } brackets. let &quot;index = $index + 1&quot; # Or: # ((index++)) done # Each array element listed on a separate line. # If this is not desired, use echo -n &quot;${colors[$index]} &quot; # # Doing it with a &quot;for&quot; loop instead: # for i in &quot;${colors[@]}&quot; # do # echo &quot;$i&quot; # done # (Thanks, S.C.) echo # Again, list all the elements in the array, but using a more elegant method. echo ${colors[@]} # echo ${colors[*]} also works. echo # The &quot;unset&quot; command deletes elements of an array, or entire array. unset colors[1] # Remove 2nd element of array. # Same effect as colors[1]= echo ${colors[@]} # List array again, missing 2nd element. unset colors # Delete entire array. # unset colors[*] and #+ unset colors[@] also work. echo; echo -n &quot;Colors gone.&quot; echo ${colors[@]} # List array again, now empty. exit 0 As seen in the previous example, either ${array_name[@]} or ${array_name[*]} refers to all the elements of the array. Similarly, to get a count of the number of elements in an array, use either ${#array_name[@]} or ${#array_name[*]}. ${#array_name} is the length (number of characters) of ${array_name[0]}, the first element of the array.

Indirect References We have seen that referencing a variable, $var, fetches its value. But, what about the value of a value? What about $$var? The actual notation is \$$var, usually preceded by an eval (and sometimes an echo). This is called an indirect reference. Example 28-1. Indirect Variable References #!/bin/bash # ind-ref.sh: Indirect variable referencing. # Accessing the contents of the contents of a variable. # First, let's fool around a little. var=23 echo &quot;\$var = $var&quot; # $var = 23 # So far, everything as expected. But ... echo &quot;\$\$var = $$var&quot; # $$var = 4570var # Not useful ... # \$\$ expanded to PID of the script # -- refer to the entry on the $$ variable -- #+ and &quot;var&quot; is echoed as plain text. # (Thank you, Jakob Bohm, for pointing this out.) echo &quot;\\\$\$var = \$$var&quot; # \$$var = $23 # As expected. The first $ is escaped and pasted on to #+ the value of var ($var = 23 ). # Meaningful, but still not useful. # Now, let's start over and do it the right way. # ============================================== # a=letter_of_alphabet # Variable &quot;a&quot; holds the name of another variable. letter_of_alphabet=z echo # Direct reference. echo &quot;a = $a&quot; # a = letter_of_alphabet # Indirect reference. eval a=\$$a # ^^^ Forcing an eval(uation), and ... # ^ Escaping the first $ ... # ------------------------------------------------------------------------ # The 'eval' forces an update of $a, sets it to the updated value of \$$a. # So, we see why 'eval' so often shows up in indirect reference notation. # ------------------------------------------------------------------------ echo &quot;Now a = $a&quot; # Now a = z echo # Now, let's try changing the second-order reference. t=table_cell_3 table_cell_3=24 echo &quot;\&quot;table_cell_3\&quot; = $table_cell_3&quot; # &quot;table_cell_3&quot; = 24 echo -n &quot;dereferenced \&quot;t\&quot; = &quot;; eval echo \$$t # dereferenced &quot;t&quot; = 24 # In this simple case, the following also works (why?). # eval t=\$$t; echo &quot;\&quot;t\&quot; = $t&quot; echo t=table_cell_3 NEW_VAL=387 table_cell_3=$NEW_VAL echo &quot;Changing value of \&quot;table_cell_3\&quot; to $NEW_VAL.&quot; echo &quot;\&quot;table_cell_3\&quot; now $table_cell_3&quot; echo -n &quot;dereferenced \&quot;t\&quot; now &quot;; eval echo \$$t # &quot;eval&quot; takes the two arguments &quot;echo&quot; and &quot;\$$t&quot; (set equal to $table_cell_3) echo # (Thanks, Stephane Chazelas, for clearing up the above behavior.) # A more straightforward method is the ${!t} notation, discussed in the #+ &quot;Bash, version 2&quot; section. # See also ex78.sh. exit 0 Indirect referencing in Bash is a multi-step process. First, take the name of a variable: varname. Then, reference it: $varname. Then, reference the reference: $$varname. Then, escape the first $: \$$varname. Finally, force a reevaluation of the expression and assign it: eval newvar=\$$varname. Of what practical use is indirect referencing of variables? It gives Bash a little of the functionality of pointers in C, for instance, in table lookup. And, it also has some other very interesting applications. . . . Nils Radtke shows how to build &quot;dynamic&quot; variable names and evaluate their contents. This can be useful when sourcing configuration files. #!/bin/bash # --------------------------------------------- # This could be &quot;sourced&quot; from a separate file. isdnMyProviderRemoteNet=172.16.0.100 isdnYourProviderRemoteNet=10.0.0.10 isdnOnlineService=&quot;MyProvider&quot; # --------------------------------------------- remoteNet=$(eval &quot;echo \$$(echo isdn${isdnOnlineService}RemoteNet)&quot;) remoteNet=$(eval &quot;echo \$$(echo isdnMyProviderRemoteNet)&quot;) remoteNet=$(eval &quot;echo \$isdnMyProviderRemoteNet&quot;) remoteNet=$(eval &quot;echo $isdnMyProviderRemoteNet&quot;) echo &quot;$remoteNet&quot; # 172.16.0.100 # ================================================================ # And, it gets even better. # Consider the following snippet given a variable named getSparc, #+ but no such variable getIa64: chkMirrorArchs () { arch=&quot;$1&quot;; if [ &quot;$(eval &quot;echo \${$(echo get$(echo -ne $arch | sed 's/^\(.\).*/\1/g' | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'; echo $arch | sed 's/^.\(.*\)/\1/g')):-false}&quot;)&quot; = true ] then return 0; else return 1; fi; } getSparc=&quot;true&quot; unset getIa64 chkMirrorArchs sparc echo $? # 0 # True chkMirrorArchs Ia64 echo $? # 1 # False # Notes: # ----- # Even the to-be-substituted variable name part is built explicitly. # The parameters to the chkMirrorArchs calls are all lower case. # The variable name is composed of two parts: &quot;get&quot; and &quot;Sparc&quot; . . .

Caution This method of indirect referencing is a bit tricky. If the second order variable changes its value, then the first order variable must be properly dereferenced (as in the above example). Fortunately, the ${!variable} notation introduced with version 2 of Bash (see Example 37-2 and Example A-22) makes indirect referencing more intuitive. Bash does not support pointer arithmetic, and this severely limits the usefulness of indirect referencing. In fact, indirect referencing in a scripting language is, at best, something of an afterthought. Chapter 29. /dev and /proc A Linux or UNIX filesystem typically has the /dev and /proc special-purpose directories. 29.1. /dev The /dev directory contains entries for the physical devices that may or may not be present in the hardware. [118] Appropriately enough, these are called device files. As an example, the hard drive partitions containing the mounted filesystem(s) have entries in /dev, as df shows. bash$ df Filesystem 1k-blocks Used Available Use% Mounted on /dev/hda6 495876 222748 247527 48% / /dev/hda1 50755 3887 44248 9% /boot /dev/hda8 367013 13262 334803 4% /home /dev/hda5 1714416 1123624 503704 70% /usr Among other things, the /dev directory contains loopback devices, such as /dev/loop0. A loopback device is a gimmick that allows an ordinary file to be accessed as if it were a block device. [119] This permits mounting an entire filesystem within a single large file. See Example 17-8 and Example 17-7. A few of the pseudo-devices in /dev have other specialized uses, such as /dev/null, /dev/zero, /dev/urandom, /dev/sda1 (hard drive partition), /dev/udp (User Datagram Packet port), and /dev/tcp. For instance: To manually mount a USB flash drive, append the following line to /etc/fstab. [120] /dev/sda1 /mnt/flashdrive auto noauto,user,noatime 0 0 (See also Example A-23.) Checking whether a disk is in the CD-burner (soft-linked to /dev/hdc): head -1 /dev/hdc # head: cannot open '/dev/hdc' for reading: No medium found # (No disc in the drive.) # head: error reading '/dev/hdc': Input/output error # (There is a disk in the drive, but it can't be read; #+ possibly it's an unrecorded CDR blank.) # Stream of characters and assorted gibberish # (There is a pre-recorded disk in the drive, #+ and this is raw output -- a stream of ASCII and binary data.) # Here we see the wisdom of using 'head' to limit the output #+ to manageable proportions, rather than 'cat' or something similar. # Now, it's just a matter of checking/parsing the output and taking #+ appropriate action. When executing a command on a /dev/tcp/$host/$port pseudo-device file, Bash opens a TCP connection to the associated socket. A socket is a communications node associated with a specific I/O port. (This is analogous to a hardware socket, or receptacle, for a connecting cable.) It permits data transfer between hardware devices on the same machine, between machines on the same network, between machines across different networks, and, of course, between machines at different locations on the Internet. The following examples assume an active Internet connection. Getting the time from nist.gov: bash$ cat &lt;/dev/tcp/time.nist.gov/13 53082 04-03-18 04:26:54 68 0 0 502.3 UTC(NIST) * [Mark contributed this example.] Generalizing the above into a script: #!/bin/bash # This script must run with root permissions.

These redirections are used identically as STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR. The device entries are 30,36 for /dev/tcp: mknod /dev/tcp c 30 36 &gt;From the bash reference: /dev/tcp/host/port If host is a valid hostname or Internet address, and port is an integer port number or service name, Bash attempts to open a TCP connection to the corresponding socket.

(May not work on all Linux distros.) Of course, caution is advised when writing to /proc. The /proc directory contains subdirectories with unusual numerical names. Every one of these names maps to the process ID of a currently running process. Within each of these subdirectories, there are a number of files that hold useful information about the corresponding process. The stat and status files keep running statistics on the process, the cmdline file holds the command-line arguments the process was invoked with, and the exe file is a symbolic link to the complete path name of the invoking process. There are a few more such files, but these seem to be the most interesting from a scripting standpoint. Example 29-3.

Network Programming The Net's a cross between an elephant and a white elephant sale: it never forgets, and it's always crap. --Nemo A Linux system has quite a number of tools for accessing, manipulating, and troubleshooting network connections. We can incorporate some of these tools into scripts -- scripts that expand our knowledge of networking, useful scripts that can facilitate the administration of a network. Here is a simple CGI script that demonstrates connecting to a remote server. Example 30-1. Print the server environment #!/bin/bash # test-cgi.sh # by Michael Zick # Used with permission # May have to change the location for your site. # (At the ISP's servers, Bash may not be in the usual place.) # Other places: /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin # Might even try it without any path in sha-bang. # Disable filename globbing. set -f # Header tells browser what to expect. echo Content-type: text/plain echo echo CGI/1.0 test script report: echo echo environment settings: set echo echo whereis bash? whereis bash echo echo who are we? echo ${BASH_VERSINFO[*]} echo echo argc is $#. argv is &quot;$*&quot;. echo # CGI/1.0 expected environment variables. echo SERVER_SOFTWARE = $SERVER_SOFTWARE echo SERVER_NAME = $SERVER_NAME echo GATEWAY_INTERFACE = $GATEWAY_INTERFACE echo SERVER_PROTOCOL = $SERVER_PROTOCOL echo SERVER_PORT = $SERVER_PORT echo REQUEST_METHOD = $REQUEST_METHOD echo HTTP_ACCEPT = &quot;$HTTP_ACCEPT&quot; echo PATH_INFO = &quot;$PATH_INFO&quot; echo PATH_TRANSLATED = &quot;$PATH_TRANSLATED&quot; echo SCRIPT_NAME = &quot;$SCRIPT_NAME&quot; echo QUERY_STRING = &quot;$QUERY_STRING&quot; echo REMOTE_HOST = $REMOTE_HOST echo REMOTE_ADDR = $REMOTE_ADDR echo REMOTE_USER = $REMOTE_USER echo AUTH_TYPE = $AUTH_TYPE echo CONTENT_TYPE = $CONTENT_TYPE echo CONTENT_LENGTH = $CONTENT_LENGTH exit 0 # Here document to give short instructions. :&lt;&lt;-'_test_CGI_' 1) Drop this in your http://domain.name/cgi-bin directory. 2) Then, open http://domain.name/cgi-bin/test-cgi.sh. _test_CGI_ For security purposes, it may be helpful to identify the IP addresses a computer is accessing.

Chapter 31. Of Zeros and Nulls Faultily faultless, icily regular, splendidly null Dead perfection; no more. --Alfred Lord Tennyson /dev/zero ... /dev/null Uses of /dev/null Think of /dev/null as a black hole. It is essentially the equivalent of a write-only file. Everything written to it disappears. Attempts to read or output from it result in nothing. All the same, /dev/null can be quite useful from both the command-line and in scripts. Suppressing stdout. cat $filename &gt;/dev/null # Contents of the file will not list to stdout. Suppressing stderr (from Example 16-3). rm $badname 2&gt;/dev/null # So error messages [stderr] deep-sixed. Suppressing output from both stdout and stderr. cat $filename 2&gt;/dev/null &gt;/dev/null # If &quot;$filename&quot; does not exist, there will be no error message output. # If &quot;$filename&quot; does exist, the contents of the file will not list to stdout. # Therefore, no output at all will result from the above line of code. # # This can be useful in situations where the return code from a command #+ needs to be tested, but no output is desired. # # cat $filename &amp;&gt;/dev/null # also works, as Baris Cicek points out. Deleting contents of a file, but preserving the file itself, with all attendant permissions (from Example 2-1 and Example 2-3): cat /dev/null &gt; /var/log/messages # : &gt; /var/log/messages has same effect, but does not spawn a new process. cat /dev/null &gt; /var/log/wtmp Automatically emptying the contents of a logfile (especially good for dealing with those nasty &quot;cookies&quot; sent by commercial Web sites): Example 31-1. Hiding the cookie jar # Obsolete Netscape browser. # Same principle applies to newer browsers. if [ -f ~/.netscape/cookies ] # Remove, if exists. then rm -f ~/.netscape/cookies fi ln -s /dev/null ~/.netscape/cookies # All cookies now get sent to a black hole, rather than saved to disk. Uses of /dev/zero Like /dev/null, /dev/zero is a pseudo-device file, but it actually produces a stream of nulls (binary zeros, not the ASCII kind). Output written to /dev/zero disappears, and it is fairly difficult to actually read the nulls emitted there, though it can be done with od or a hex editor. The chief use of /dev/zero is creating an initialized dummy file of predetermined length intended as a temporary swap file. Example 31-2. Setting up a swapfile using /dev/zero #!/bin/bash # Creating a swap file. # A swap file provides a temporary storage cache #+ which helps speed up certain filesystem operations. ROOT_UID=0 # Root has $UID 0. E_WRONG_USER=85 # Not root? FILE=/swap BLOCKSIZE=1024 MINBLOCKS=40 SUCCESS=0 # This script must be run as root. if [ &quot;$UID&quot; -ne &quot;$ROOT_UID&quot; ] then echo; echo &quot;You must be root to run this script.&quot;; echo exit $E_WRONG_USER fi blocks=${1:-$MINBLOCKS} # Set to default of 40 blocks, #+ if nothing specified on command-line. # This is the equivalent of the command block below. # -------------------------------------------------- # if [ -n &quot;$1&quot; ] # then # blocks=$1 # else # blocks=$MINBLOCKS # fi # -------------------------------------------------- if [ &quot;$blocks&quot; -lt $MINBLOCKS ] then blocks=$MINBLOCKS # Must be at least 40 blocks long. fi ###################################################################### echo &quot;Creating swap file of size $blocks blocks (KB).&quot; dd if=/dev/zero of=$FILE bs=$BLOCKSIZE count=$blocks # Zero out file. mkswap $FILE $blocks # Designate it a swap file. swapon $FILE # Activate swap file. retcode=$? # Everything worked? # Note that if one or more of these commands fails, #+ then it could cause nasty problems. ###################################################################### # Exercise: # Rewrite the above block of code so that if it does not execute #+ successfully, then: # 1) an error message is echoed to stderr, # 2) all temporary files are cleaned up, and # 3) the script exits in an orderly fashion with an #+ appropriate error code. echo &quot;Swap file created and activated.&quot; exit $retcode Another application of /dev/zero is to &quot;zero out&quot; a file of a designated size for a special purpose, such as mounting a filesystem on a loopback device (see Example 17-8) or &quot;securely&quot; deleting a file (see Example 16-61). Example 31-3. Creating a ramdisk #!/bin/bash # ramdisk.sh # A &quot;ramdisk&quot; is a segment of system RAM memory #+ which acts as if it were a filesystem. # Its advantage is very fast access (read/write time). # Disadvantages: volatility, loss of data on reboot or powerdown, #+ less RAM available to system. # # Of what use is a ramdisk? # Keeping a large dataset, such as a table or dictionary on ramdisk, #+ speeds up data lookup, since memory access is much faster than disk access. E_NON_ROOT_USER=70 # Must run as root. ROOTUSER_NAME=root MOUNTPT=/mnt/ramdisk # Create with mkdir /mnt/ramdisk. SIZE=2000 # 2K blocks (change as appropriate) BLOCKSIZE=1024 # 1K (1024 byte) block size DEVICE=/dev/ram0 # First ram device username=`id -nu` if [ &quot;$username&quot; != &quot;$ROOTUSER_NAME&quot; ] then echo &quot;Must be root to run \&quot;`basename $0`\&quot;.&quot; exit $E_NON_ROOT_USER fi if [ ! -d &quot;$MOUNTPT&quot; ] # Test whether mount point already there, then #+ so no error if this script is run mkdir $MOUNTPT #+ multiple times. fi ############################################################################## dd if=/dev/zero of=$DEVICE count=$SIZE bs=$BLOCKSIZE # Zero out RAM device. # Why is this necessary? mke2fs $DEVICE # Create an ext2 filesystem on it. mount $DEVICE $MOUNTPT # Mount it. chmod 777 $MOUNTPT # Enables ordinary user to access ramdisk. # However, must be root to unmount it. ############################################################################## # Need to test whether above commands succeed. Could cause problems otherwise. # Exercise: modify this script to make it safer. echo &quot;\&quot;$MOUNTPT\&quot; now available for use.&quot; # The ramdisk is now accessible for storing files, even by an ordinary user. # Caution, the ramdisk is volatile, and its contents will disappear #+ on reboot or power loss. # Copy anything you want saved to a regular directory. # After reboot, run this script to again set up ramdisk. # Remounting /mnt/ramdisk without the other steps will not work. # Suitably modified, this script can by invoked in /etc/rc.d/rc.local, #+ to set up ramdisk automatically at bootup. # That may be appropriate on, for example, a database server. exit 0 In addition to all the above, /dev/zero is needed by ELF (Executable and Linking Format) UNIX/Linux binaries. Chapter 32. Debugging Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it. --Brian Kernighan The Bash shell contains no built-in debugger, and only bare-bones debugging-specific commands and constructs. Syntax errors or outright typos in the script generate cryptic error messages that are often of no help in debugging a non-functional script. Example 32-1. A buggy script #!/bin/bash # ex74.sh # This is a buggy script. # Where, oh where is the error? a=37 if [$a -gt 27 ] then echo $a fi exit $? # 0! Why? Output from script: ./ex74.sh: [37: command not found What's wrong with the above script? Hint: after the if. Example 32-2. Missing keyword #!/bin/bash # missing-keyword.sh # What error message will this script generate? And why? for a in 1 2 3 do echo &quot;$a&quot; # done # Required keyword 'done' commented out in line 8. exit 0 # Will not exit here! # === # # From command line, after script terminates: echo $? # 2 Output from script: missing-keyword.sh: line 10: syntax error: unexpected end of file Note that the error message does not necessarily reference the line in which the error occurs, but the line where the Bash interpreter finally becomes aware of the error. Error messages may disregard comment lines in a script when reporting the line number of a syntax error. What if the script executes, but does not work as expected? This is the all too familiar logic error. Example 32-3. test24: another buggy script #!/bin/bash # This script is supposed to delete all filenames in current directory #+ containing embedded spaces. # It doesn't work. # Why not? badname=`ls | grep ' '` # Try this: # echo &quot;$badname&quot; rm &quot;$badname&quot; exit 0 Try to find out what's wrong with Example 32-3 by uncommenting the echo &quot;$badname&quot; line. Echo statements are useful for seeing whether what you expect is actually what you get. In this particular case, rm &quot;$badname&quot; will not give the desired results because $badname should not be quoted. Placing it in quotes ensures that rm has only one argument (it will match only one filename). A partial fix is to remove to quotes from $badname and to reset $IFS to contain only a newline, IFS=$'\n'. However, there are simpler ways of going about it. # Correct methods of deleting filenames containing spaces. rm *\ * rm *&quot; &quot;* rm *' '* # Thank you. S.C. Summarizing the symptoms of a buggy script, It bombs with a &quot;syntax error&quot; message, or It runs, but does not work as expected (logic error). It runs, works as expected, but has nasty side effects (logic bomb). Tools for debugging non-working scripts include Inserting echo statements at critical points in the script to trace the variables, and otherwise give a snapshot of what is going on. Tip Even better is an echo that echoes only when debug is on. ### debecho (debug-echo), by Stefano Falsetto ### ### Will echo passed parameters only if DEBUG is set to a value. ### debecho () { if [ ! -z &quot;$DEBUG&quot; ]; then echo &quot;$1&quot; &gt;&amp;2 # ^^^ to stderr fi } DEBUG=on Whatever=whatnot debecho $Whatever # whatnot DEBUG= Whatever=notwhat debecho $Whatever # (Will not echo.) Using the tee filter to check processes or data flows at critical points. Setting option flags -n -v -x sh -n scriptname checks for syntax errors without actually running the script. This is the equivalent of inserting set -n or set -o noexec into the script. Note that certain types of syntax errors can slip past this check. sh -v scriptname echoes each command before executing it. This is the equivalent of inserting set -v or set -o verbose in the script. The -n and -v flags work well together. sh -nv scriptname gives a verbose syntax check. sh -x scriptname echoes the result each command, but in an abbreviated manner. This is the equivalent of inserting set -x or set -o xtrace in the script. Inserting set -u or set -o nounset in the script runs it, but gives an unbound variable error message and aborts the script. set -u # Or set -o nounset # Setting a variable to null will not trigger the error/abort. # unset_var= echo $unset_var # Unset (and undeclared) variable. echo &quot;Should not echo!&quot; # sh t2.sh # t2.sh: line 6: unset_var: unbound variable Using an &quot;assert&quot; function to test a variable or condition at critical points in a script. (This is an idea borrowed from C.) Example 32-4. Testing a condition with an assert #!/bin/bash # assert.sh ####################################################################### assert () # If condition false, { #+ exit from script #+ with appropriate error message. E_PARAM_ERR=98 E_ASSERT_FAILED=99 if [ -z &quot;$2&quot; ] # Not enough parameters passed then #+ to assert() function. return $E_PARAM_ERR # No damage done. fi lineno=$2 if [ ! $1 ] then echo &quot;Assertion failed: \&quot;$1\&quot;&quot; echo &quot;File \&quot;$0\&quot;, line $lineno&quot; # Give name of file and line number. exit $E_ASSERT_FAILED # else # return # and continue executing the script. fi } # Insert a similar assert() function into a script you need to debug. ####################################################################### a=5 b=4 condition=&quot;$a -lt $b&quot; # Error message and exit from script. # Try setting &quot;condition&quot; to something else #+ and see what happens. assert &quot;$condition&quot; $LINENO # The remainder of the script executes only if the &quot;assert&quot; does not fail. # Some commands. # Some more commands . . . echo &quot;This statement echoes only if the \&quot;assert\&quot; does not fail.&quot; # . . . # More commands . . . exit $? Using the $LINENO variable and the caller builtin. Trapping at exit. The exit command in a script triggers a signal 0, terminating the process, that is, the script itself. [122] It is often useful to trap the exit, forcing a &quot;printout&quot; of variables, for example. The trap must be the first command in the script. Trapping signals trap Specifies an action on receipt of a signal; also useful for debugging. A signal is a message sent to a process, either by the kernel or another process, telling it to take some specified action (usually to terminate). For example, hitting a Control-C sends a user interrupt, an INT signal, to a running program. A simple instance: trap '' 2 # Ignore interrupt 2 (Control-C), with no action specified. trap 'echo &quot;Control-C disabled.&quot;' 2 # Message when Control-C pressed. Example 32-5. Trapping at exit #!/bin/bash # Hunting variables with a trap. trap 'echo Variable Listing --- a = $a b = $b' EXIT # EXIT is the name of the signal generated upon exit from a script. # # The command specified by the &quot;trap&quot; doesn't execute until #+ the appropriate signal is sent. echo &quot;This prints before the \&quot;trap\&quot; --&quot; echo &quot;even though the script sees the \&quot;trap\&quot; first.&quot; echo a=39 b=36 exit 0 # Note that commenting out the 'exit' command makes no difference, #+ since the script exits in any case after running out of commands. Example 32-6. Cleaning up after Control-C #!/bin/bash # logon.sh: A quick 'n dirty script to check whether you are on-line yet. umask 177 # Make sure temp files are not world readable. TRUE=1 LOGFILE=/var/log/messages # Note that $LOGFILE must be readable #+ (as root, chmod 644 /var/log/messages). TEMPFILE=temp.$$ # Create a &quot;unique&quot; temp file name, using process id of the script. # Using 'mktemp' is an alternative. # For example: # TEMPFILE=`mktemp temp.XXXXXX` KEYWORD=address # At logon, the line &quot;remote IP address xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx&quot; # appended to /var/log/messages. ONLINE=22 USER_INTERRUPT=13 CHECK_LINES=100 # How many lines in log file to check. trap 'rm -f $TEMPFILE; exit $USER_INTERRUPT' TERM INT # Cleans up the temp file if script interrupted by control-c. echo while [ $TRUE ] #Endless loop. do tail -n $CHECK_LINES $LOGFILE&gt; $TEMPFILE # Saves last 100 lines of system log file as temp file. # Necessary, since newer kernels generate many log messages at log on. search=`grep $KEYWORD $TEMPFILE` # Checks for presence of the &quot;IP address&quot; phrase, #+ indicating a successful logon. if [ ! -z &quot;$search&quot; ] # Quotes necessary because of possible spaces. then echo &quot;On-line&quot; rm -f $TEMPFILE # Clean up temp file. exit $ONLINE else echo -n &quot;.&quot; # The -n option to echo suppresses newline, #+ so you get continuous rows of dots. fi sleep 1 done # Note: if you change the KEYWORD variable to &quot;Exit&quot;, #+ this script can be used while on-line #+ to check for an unexpected logoff. # Exercise: Change the script, per the above note, # and prettify it. exit 0 # Nick Drage suggests an alternate method: while true do ifconfig ppp0 | grep UP 1&gt; /dev/null &amp;&amp; echo &quot;connected&quot; &amp;&amp; exit 0 echo -n &quot;.&quot; # Prints dots (.....) until connected. sleep 2 done # Problem: Hitting Control-C to terminate this process may be insufficient. #+ (Dots may keep on echoing.) # Exercise: Fix this. # Stephane Chazelas has yet another alternative: CHECK_INTERVAL=1 while ! tail -n 1 &quot;$LOGFILE&quot; | grep -q &quot;$KEYWORD&quot; do echo -n . sleep $CHECK_INTERVAL done echo &quot;On-line&quot; # Exercise: Discuss the relative strengths and weaknesses # of each of these various approaches. Example 32-7. A Simple Implementation of a Progress Bar #! /bin/bash # progress-bar2.sh # Author: Graham Ewart (with reformatting by ABS Guide author). # Used in ABS Guide with permission (thanks!). # Invoke this script with bash. It doesn't work with sh. interval=1 long_interval=10 { trap &quot;exit&quot; SIGUSR1 sleep $interval; sleep $interval while true do echo -n '.' # Use dots. sleep $interval done; } &amp; # Start a progress bar as a background process. pid=$! trap &quot;echo !; kill -USR1 $pid; wait $pid&quot; EXIT # To handle ^C. echo -n 'Long-running process ' sleep $long_interval echo ' Finished!' kill -USR1 $pid wait $pid # Stop the progress bar. trap EXIT exit $? Note The DEBUG argument to trap causes a specified action to execute after every command in a script. This permits tracing variables, for example. Example 32-8. Tracing a variable #!/bin/bash trap 'echo &quot;VARIABLE-TRACE&gt; \$variable = \&quot;$variable\&quot;&quot;' DEBUG # Echoes the value of $variable after every command. variable=29; line=$LINENO echo &quot; Just initialized \$variable to $variable in line number $line.&quot; let &quot;variable *= 3&quot;; line=$LINENO echo &quot; Just multiplied \$variable by 3 in line number $line.&quot; exit 0 # The &quot;trap 'command1 . . . command2 . . .' DEBUG&quot; construct is #+ more appropriate in the context of a complex script, #+ where inserting multiple &quot;echo $variable&quot; statements might be #+ awkward and time-consuming. # Thanks, Stephane Chazelas for the pointer. Output of script: VARIABLE-TRACE&gt; $variable = &quot;&quot; VARIABLE-TRACE&gt; $variable = &quot;29&quot; Just initialized $variable to 29. VARIABLE-TRACE&gt; $variable = &quot;29&quot; VARIABLE-TRACE&gt; $variable = &quot;87&quot; Just multiplied $variable by 3. VARIABLE-TRACE&gt; $variable = &quot;87&quot; Of course, the trap command has other uses aside from debugging, such as disabling certain keystrokes within a script (see Example A-43). Example 32-9.

The &quot;wait&quot; instruction does not help, since it waits for a given process or *all* process started in background. So I wrote [this] bash script that can do the job, using the &quot;trap&quot; instruction. --Vernia Damiano SCRIPT_AUTHOR_COMMENTS Note trap '' SIGNAL (two adjacent apostrophes) disables SIGNAL for the remainder of the script. trap SIGNAL restores the functioning of SIGNAL once more. This is useful to protect a critical portion of a script from an undesirable interrupt. trap '' 2 # Signal 2 is Control-C, now disabled. command command command trap 2 # Reenables Control-C Version 3 of Bash adds the following internal variables for use by the debugger. $BASH_ARGC Number of command-line arguments passed to script, similar to $#. $BASH_ARGV Final command-line parameter passed to script, equivalent ${!#}. $BASH_COMMAND Command currently executing. $BASH_EXECUTION_STRING The option string following the -c option to Bash. $BASH_LINENO In a function, indicates the line number of the function call. $BASH_REMATCH Array variable associated with =~ conditional regex matching. $BASH_SOURCE This is the name of the script, usually the same as $0. $BASH_SUBSHELL Chapter 33. Options Options are settings that change shell and/or script behavior. The set command enables options within a script. At the point in the script where you want the options to take effect, use set -o option-name or, in short form, set -option-abbrev. These two forms are equivalent. #!/bin/bash set -o verbose # Echoes all commands before executing. #!/bin/bash set -v # Exact same effect as above. Note To disable an option within a script, use set +o option-name or set +option-abbrev. #!/bin/bash set -o verbose # Command echoing on. command ... command set +o verbose # Command echoing off. command # Not echoed. set -v # Command echoing on. command ... command set +v # Command echoing off. command exit 0 An alternate method of enabling options in a script is to specify them immediately following the #! script header. #!/bin/bash -x # # Body of script follows. It is also possible to enable script options from the command line. Some options that will not work with set are available this way. Among these are -i, force script to run interactive. bash -v script-name bash -o verbose script-name The following is a listing of some useful options. They may be specified in either abbreviated form (preceded by a single dash) or by complete name (preceded by a double dash or by -o). Table 33-1. Bash options Abbreviation Name Effect -B brace expansion Enable brace expansion (default setting = on) +B brace expansion Disable brace expansion -C noclobber Prevent overwriting of files by redirection (may be overridden by &gt;|) -D (none) List double-quoted strings prefixed by $, but do not execute commands in script -a allexport Export all defined variables -b notify Notify when jobs running in background terminate (not of much use in a script) -c ...

Gotchas Turandot: Gli enigmi sono tre, la morte una! Caleph: No, no! Gli enigmi sono tre, una la vita! --Puccini Here are some (non-recommended!) scripting practices that will bring excitement into an otherwise dull life. Assigning reserved words or characters to variable names. case=value0 # Causes problems. 23skidoo=value1 # Also problems. # Variable names starting with a digit are reserved by the shell. # Try _23skidoo=value1. Starting variables with an underscore is okay. # However . . . using just an underscore will not work. _=25 echo $_ # $_ is a special variable set to last arg of last command. # But . . . _ is a valid function name! xyz((!*=value2 # Causes severe problems. # As of version 3 of Bash, periods are not allowed within variable names. Using a hyphen or other reserved characters in a variable name (or function name). var-1=23 # Use 'var_1' instead. function-whatever () # Error # Use 'function_whatever ()' instead. # As of version 3 of Bash, periods are not allowed within function names. function.whatever () # Error # Use 'functionWhatever ()' instead. Using the same name for a variable and a function. This can make a script difficult to understand. do_something () { echo &quot;This function does something with \&quot;$1\&quot;.&quot; } do_something=do_something do_something do_something # All this is legal, but highly confusing. Using whitespace inappropriately. In contrast to other programming languages, Bash can be quite finicky about whitespace. var1 = 23 # 'var1=23' is correct. # On line above, Bash attempts to execute command &quot;var1&quot; # with the arguments &quot;=&quot; and &quot;23&quot;. let c = $a - $b # Instead: let c=$a-$b or let &quot;c = $a - $b&quot; if [ $a -le 5] # if [ $a -le 5 ] is correct. # ^^ if [ &quot;$a&quot; -le 5 ] is even better. # [[ $a -le 5 ]] also works. Not terminating with a semicolon the final command in a code block within curly brackets. { ls -l; df; echo &quot;Done.&quot; } # bash: syntax error: unexpected end of file { ls -l; df; echo &quot;Done.&quot;; } # ^ ### Final command needs semicolon. Assuming uninitialized variables (variables before a value is assigned to them) are &quot;zeroed out&quot;. An uninitialized variable has a value of null, not zero. #!/bin/bash echo &quot;uninitialized_var = $uninitialized_var&quot; # uninitialized_var = # However . . . # if $BASH_VERSION ≥ 4.2; then if [[ ! -v uninitialized_var ]] then uninitialized_var=0 # Initialize it to zero! fi Mixing up = and -eq in a test. Remember, = is for comparing literal variables and -eq for integers. if [ &quot;$a&quot; = 273 ] # Is $a an integer or string? if [ &quot;$a&quot; -eq 273 ] # If $a is an integer. # Sometimes you can interchange -eq and = without adverse consequences. # However . . . a=273.0 # Not an integer. if [ &quot;$a&quot; = 273 ] then echo &quot;Comparison works.&quot; else echo &quot;Comparison does not work.&quot; fi # Comparison does not work. # Same with a=&quot; 273&quot; and a=&quot;0273&quot;. # Likewise, problems trying to use &quot;-eq&quot; with non-integer values. if [ &quot;$a&quot; -eq 273.0 ] then echo &quot;a = $a&quot; fi # Aborts with an error message. # test.sh: [: 273.0: integer expression expected Misusing string comparison operators. Example 34-1. Numerical and string comparison are not equivalent #!/bin/bash # bad-op.sh: Trying to use a string comparison on integers. echo number=1 # The following while-loop has two errors: #+ one blatant, and the other subtle. while [ &quot;$number&quot; &lt; 5 ] # Wrong! Should be: while [ &quot;$number&quot; -lt 5 ] do echo -n &quot;$number &quot; let &quot;number += 1&quot; done # Attempt to run this bombs with the error message: #+ bad-op.sh: line 10: 5: No such file or directory # Within single brackets, &quot;&lt;&quot; must be escaped, #+ and even then, it's still wrong for comparing integers. echo &quot;---------------------&quot; while [ &quot;$number&quot; \&lt; 5 ] # 1 2 3 4 do # echo -n &quot;$number &quot; # It *seems* to work, but . . . let &quot;number += 1&quot; #+ it actually does an ASCII comparison, done #+ rather than a numerical one. echo; echo &quot;---------------------&quot; # This can cause problems. For example: lesser=5 greater=105 if [ &quot;$greater&quot; \&lt; &quot;$lesser&quot; ] then echo &quot;$greater is less than $lesser&quot; fi # 105 is less than 5 # In fact, &quot;105&quot; actually is less than &quot;5&quot; #+ in a string comparison (ASCII sort order). echo exit 0 Attempting to use let to set string variables. let &quot;a = hello, you&quot; echo &quot;$a&quot; # 0 Sometimes variables within &quot;test&quot; brackets ([ ]) need to be quoted (double quotes). Failure to do so may cause unexpected behavior. See Example 7-6, Example 20-5, and Example 9-6. Quoting a variable containing whitespace prevents splitting. Sometimes this produces unintended consequences. Commands issued from a script may fail to execute because the script owner lacks execute permission for them. If a user cannot invoke a command from the command-line, then putting it into a script will likewise fail. Try changing the attributes of the command in question, perhaps even setting the suid bit (as root, of course). Attempting to use - as a redirection operator (which it is not) will usually result in an unpleasant surprise. command1 2&gt; - | command2 # Trying to redirect error output of command1 into a pipe . . . # . . . will not work. command1 2&gt;&amp; - | command2 # Also futile. Thanks, S.C. Using Bash version 2+ functionality may cause a bailout with error messages. Older Linux machines may have version 1.XX of Bash as the default installation. #!/bin/bash minimum_version=2 # Since Chet Ramey is constantly adding features to Bash, # you may set $minimum_version to 2.XX, 3.XX, or whatever is appropriate. E_BAD_VERSION=80 if [ &quot;$BASH_VERSION&quot; \&lt; &quot;$minimum_version&quot; ] then echo &quot;This script works only with Bash, version $minimum or greater.&quot; echo &quot;Upgrade strongly recommended.&quot; exit $E_BAD_VERSION fi ... Using Bash-specific functionality in a Bourne shell script (#!/bin/sh) on a non-Linux machine may cause unexpected behavior. A Linux system usually aliases sh to bash, but this does not necessarily hold true for a generic UNIX machine. Using undocumented features in Bash turns out to be a dangerous practice. In previous releases of this book there were several scripts that depended on the &quot;feature&quot; that, although the maximum value of an exit or return value was 255, that limit did not apply to negative integers. Unfortunately, in version 2.05b and later, that loophole disappeared. See Example 24-9. In certain contexts, a misleading exit status may be returned. This may occur when setting a local variable within a function or when assigning an arithmetic value to a variable. The exit status of an arithmetic expression is not equivalent to an error code. var=1 &amp;&amp; ((--var)) &amp;&amp; echo $var # ^^^^^^^^^ Here the and-list terminates with exit status 1. # $var doesn't echo! echo $? # 1 A script with DOS-type newlines (\r\n) will fail to execute, since #!/bin/bash\r\n is not recognized, not the same as the expected #!/bin/bash\n. The fix is to convert the script to UNIX-style newlines. #!/bin/bash echo &quot;Here&quot; unix2dos $0 # Script changes itself to DOS format. chmod 755 $0 # Change back to execute permission. # The 'unix2dos' command removes execute permission. ./$0 # Script tries to run itself again. # But it won't work as a DOS file. echo &quot;There&quot; exit 0 A shell script headed by #!/bin/sh will not run in full Bash-compatibility mode. Some Bash-specific functions might be disabled. Scripts that need complete access to all the Bash-specific extensions should start with #!/bin/bash. Putting whitespace in front of the terminating limit string of a here document will cause unexpected behavior in a script. Putting more than one echo statement in a function whose output is captured. add2 () { echo &quot;Whatever ... &quot; # Delete this line! let &quot;retval = $1 + $2&quot; echo $retval } num1=12 num2=43 echo &quot;Sum of $num1 and $num2 = $(add2 $num1 $num2)&quot; # Sum of 12 and 43 = Whatever ... # 55 # The &quot;echoes&quot; concatenate. This will not work. A script may not export variables back to its parent process, the shell, or to the environment. Just as we learned in biology, a child process can inherit from a parent, but not vice versa. WHATEVER=/home/bozo export WHATEVER exit 0 bash$ echo $WHATEVER bash$ Sure enough, back at the command prompt, $WHATEVER remains unset. Setting and manipulating variables in a subshell, then attempting to use those same variables outside the scope of the subshell will result an unpleasant surprise. Example 34-2.

Piping echo output to a read may produce unexpected results. In this scenario, the read acts as if it were running in a subshell. Instead, use the set command (as in Example 15-18). Example 34-3.

Using &quot;suid&quot; commands within scripts is risky, as it may compromise system security. [123] Using shell scripts for CGI programming may be problematic. Shell script variables are not &quot;typesafe,&quot; and this can cause undesirable behavior as far as CGI is concerned. Moreover, it is difficult to &quot;cracker-proof&quot; shell scripts. Bash does not handle the double slash (//) string correctly. Bash scripts written for Linux or BSD systems may need fixups to run on a commercial UNIX machine. Such scripts often employ the GNU set of commands and filters, which have greater functionality than their generic UNIX counterparts. This is particularly true of such text processing utilites as tr. Sadly, updates to Bash itself have broken older scripts that used to work perfectly fine. Let us recall how risky it is to use undocumented Bash features. Danger is near thee -- Beware, beware, beware, beware. Many brave hearts are asleep in the deep. So beware -- Beware. --A.J. Lamb and H.W. Petrie Chapter 35. Scripting With Style Get into the habit of writing shell scripts in a structured and systematic manner. Even on-the-fly and &quot;written on the back of an envelope&quot; scripts will benefit if you take a few minutes to plan and organize your thoughts before sitting down and coding. Herewith are a few stylistic guidelines. This is not (necessarily) intended as an Official Shell Scripting Stylesheet. 35.1. Unofficial Shell Scripting Stylesheet Comment your code. This makes it easier for others to understand (and appreciate), and easier for you to maintain. PASS=&quot;$PASS${MATRIX:$(($RANDOM%${#MATRIX})):1}&quot; # It made perfect sense when you wrote it last year, #+ but now it's a complete mystery. # (From Antek Sawicki's &quot;pw.sh&quot; script.) Add descriptive headers to your scripts and functions. #!/bin/bash #************************************************# # xyz.sh # # written by Bozo Bozeman # # July 05, 2001 # # # # Clean up project files. # #************************************************# E_BADDIR=85 # No such directory. projectdir=/home/bozo/projects # Directory to clean up. # --------------------------------------------------------- # # cleanup_pfiles () # # Removes all files in designated directory. # # Parameter: $target_directory # # Returns: 0 on success, $E_BADDIR if something went wrong. # # --------------------------------------------------------- # cleanup_pfiles () { if [ ! -d &quot;$1&quot; ] # Test if target directory exists. then echo &quot;$1 is not a directory.&quot; return $E_BADDIR fi rm -f &quot;$1&quot;/* return 0 # Success. } cleanup_pfiles $projectdir exit $? Avoid using &quot;magic numbers,&quot; [124] that is, &quot;hard-wired&quot; literal constants. Use meaningful variable names instead. This makes the script easier to understand and permits making changes and updates without breaking the application. if [ -f /var/log/messages ] then ... fi # A year later, you decide to change the script to check /var/log/syslog. # It is now necessary to manually change the script, instance by instance, #+ and hope nothing breaks. # A better way: LOGFILE=/var/log/messages # Only line that needs to be changed. if [ -f &quot;$LOGFILE&quot; ] then ... fi Choose descriptive names for variables and functions. fl=`ls -al $dirname` # Cryptic. file_listing=`ls -al $dirname` # Better. MAXVAL=10 # All caps used for a script constant. while [ &quot;$index&quot; -le &quot;$MAXVAL&quot; ] ... E_NOTFOUND=95 # Uppercase for an errorcode, #+ and name prefixed with E_. if [ ! -e &quot;$filename&quot; ] then echo &quot;File $filename not found.&quot; exit $E_NOTFOUND fi MAIL_DIRECTORY=/var/spool/mail/bozo # Uppercase for an environmental export MAIL_DIRECTORY #+ variable. GetAnswer () # Mixed case works well for a { #+ function name, especially prompt=$1 #+ when it improves legibility. echo -n $prompt read answer return $answer } GetAnswer &quot;What is your favorite number? &quot; favorite_number=$? echo $favorite_number _uservariable=23 # Permissible, but not recommended. # It's better for user-defined variables not to start with an underscore. # Leave that for system variables. Use exit codes in a systematic and meaningful way. E_WRONG_ARGS=95 ... ... exit $E_WRONG_ARGS See also Appendix E. Ender suggests using the exit codes in /usr/include/sysexits.h in shell scripts, though these are primarily intended for C and C++ programming. Use standardized parameter flags for script invocation. Ender proposes the following set of flags. -a All: Return all information (including hidden file info). -b Brief: Short version, usually for other scripts. -c Copy, concatenate, etc. -d Daily: Use information from the whole day, and not merely information for a specific instance/user. -e Extended/Elaborate: (often does not include hidden file info). -h Help: Verbose usage w/descs, aux info, discussion, help. See also -V. -l Log output of script. -m Manual: Launch man-page for base command. -n Numbers: Numerical data only. -r Recursive: All files in a directory (and/or all sub-dirs). -s Setup &amp; File Maintenance: Config files for this script. -u Usage: List of invocation flags for the script. -v Verbose: Human readable output, more or less formatted. -V Version / License / Copy(right|left) / Contribs (email too). See also Section G.1. Break complex scripts into simpler modules. Use functions where appropriate. See Example 37-4. Don't use a complex construct where a simpler one will do. COMMAND if [ $? -eq 0 ] ... # Redundant and non-intuitive. if COMMAND ... # More concise (if perhaps not quite as legible). ... reading the UNIX source code to the Bourne shell (/bin/sh). I was shocked at how much simple algorithms could be made cryptic, and therefore useless, by a poor choice of code style. I asked myself, &quot;Could someone be proud of this code?&quot; --Landon Noll Chapter 36. Miscellany Nobody really knows what the Bourne shell's grammar is. Even examination of the source code is little help. --Tom Duff 36.1. Interactive and non-interactive shells and scripts An interactive shell reads commands from user input on a tty. Among other things, such a shell reads startup files on activation, displays a prompt, and enables job control by default. The user can interact with the shell. A shell running a script is always a non-interactive shell. All the same, the script can still access its tty. It is even possible to emulate an interactive shell in a script. #!/bin/bash MY_PROMPT='$ ' while : do echo -n &quot;$MY_PROMPT&quot; read line eval &quot;$line&quot; done exit 0 # This example script, and much of the above explanation supplied by # Stéphane Chazelas (thanks again). Let us consider an interactive script to be one that requires input from the user, usually with read statements (see Example 15-3). &quot;Real life&quot; is actually a bit messier than that. For now, assume an interactive script is bound to a tty, a script that a user has invoked from the console or an xterm. Init and startup scripts are necessarily non-interactive, since they must run without human intervention. Many administrative and system maintenance scripts are likewise non-interactive. Unvarying repetitive tasks cry out for automation by non-interactive scripts. Non-interactive scripts can run in the background, but interactive ones hang, waiting for input that never comes. Handle that difficulty by having an expect script or embedded here document feed input to an interactive script running as a background job. In the simplest case, redirect a file to supply input to a read statement (read variable &lt;file). These particular workarounds make possible general purpose scripts that run in either interactive or non-interactive modes. If a script needs to test whether it is running in an interactive shell, it is simply a matter of finding whether the prompt variable, $PS1 is set. (If the user is being prompted for input, then the script needs to display a prompt.) if [ -z $PS1 ] # no prompt? ### if [ -v PS1 ] # On Bash 4.2+ ... then # non-interactive ... else # interactive ... fi Alternatively, the script can test for the presence of option &quot;i&quot; in the $- flag. case $- in *i*) # interactive shell ;; *) # non-interactive shell ;; # (Courtesy of &quot;UNIX F.A.Q.,&quot; 1993) However, John Lange describes an alternative method, using the -t test operator. # Test for a terminal! fd=0 # stdin # As we recall, the -t test option checks whether the stdin, [ -t 0 ], #+ or stdout, [ -t 1 ], in a given script is running in a terminal. if [ -t &quot;$fd&quot; ] then echo interactive else echo non-interactive fi # But, as John points out: # if [ -t 0 ] works ... when you're logged in locally # but fails when you invoke the command remotely via ssh. # So for a true test you also have to test for a socket. if [[ -t &quot;$fd&quot; || -p /dev/stdin ]] then echo interactive else echo non-interactive fi Note Scripts may be forced to run in interactive mode with the -i option or with a #!/bin/bash -i header. Be aware that this can cause erratic script behavior or show error messages even when no error is present. 36.2. Shell Wrappers A wrapper is a shell script that embeds a system command or utility, that accepts and passes a set of parameters to that command. [125] Wrapping a script around a complex command-line simplifies invoking it. This is expecially useful with sed and awk. A sed or awk script would normally be invoked from the command-line by a sed -e 'commands' or awk 'commands'. Embedding such a script in a Bash script permits calling it more simply, and makes it reusable. This also enables combining the functionality of sed and awk, for example piping the output of a set of sed commands to awk. As a saved executable file, you can then repeatedly invoke it in its original form or modified, without the inconvenience of retyping it on the command-line. Example 36-1. shell wrapper #!/bin/bash # This simple script removes blank lines from a file. # No argument checking. # # You might wish to add something like: # # E_NOARGS=85 # if [ -z &quot;$1&quot; ] # then # echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` target-file&quot; # exit $E_NOARGS # fi sed -e /^$/d &quot;$1&quot; # Same as # sed -e '/^$/d' filename # invoked from the command-line. # The '-e' means an &quot;editing&quot; command follows (optional here). # '^' indicates the beginning of line, '$' the end. # This matches lines with nothing between the beginning and the end -- #+ blank lines. # The 'd' is the delete command. # Quoting the command-line arg permits #+ whitespace and special characters in the filename. # Note that this script doesn't actually change the target file. # If you need to do that, redirect its output. exit Example 36-2. A slightly more complex shell wrapper #!/bin/bash # subst.sh: a script that substitutes one pattern for #+ another in a file, #+ i.e., &quot;sh subst.sh Smith Jones letter.txt&quot;. # Jones replaces Smith. ARGS=3 # Script requires 3 arguments. E_BADARGS=85 # Wrong number of arguments passed to script. if [ $# -ne &quot;$ARGS&quot; ] then echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` old-pattern new-pattern filename&quot; exit $E_BADARGS fi old_pattern=$1 new_pattern=$2 if [ -f &quot;$3&quot; ] then file_name=$3 else echo &quot;File \&quot;$3\&quot; does not exist.&quot; exit $E_BADARGS fi # ----------------------------------------------- # Here is where the heavy work gets done. sed -e &quot;s/$old_pattern/$new_pattern/g&quot; $file_name # ----------------------------------------------- # 's' is, of course, the substitute command in sed, #+ and /pattern/ invokes address matching. # The 'g,' or global flag causes substitution for EVERY #+ occurence of $old_pattern on each line, not just the first. # Read the 'sed' docs for an in-depth explanation. exit $? # Redirect the output of this script to write to a file. Example 36-3. A generic shell wrapper that writes to a logfile #!/bin/bash # logging-wrapper.sh # Generic shell wrapper that performs an operation #+ and logs it. DEFAULT_LOGFILE=logfile.txt # Set the following two variables. OPERATION= # Can be a complex chain of commands, #+ for example an awk script or a pipe . . . LOGFILE= if [ -z &quot;$LOGFILE&quot; ] then # If not set, default to ... LOGFILE=&quot;$DEFAULT_LOGFILE&quot; fi # Command-line arguments, if any, for the operation. OPTIONS=&quot;$@&quot; # Log it. echo &quot;`date` + `whoami` + $OPERATION &quot;$@&quot;&quot; &gt;&gt; $LOGFILE # Now, do it. exec $OPERATION &quot;$@&quot; # It's necessary to do the logging before the operation. # Why? Example 36-4. A shell wrapper around an awk script #!/bin/bash # pr-ascii.sh: Prints a table of ASCII characters. START=33 # Range of printable ASCII characters (decimal). END=127 # Will not work for unprintable characters (&gt; 127). echo &quot; Decimal Hex Character&quot; # Header. echo &quot; ------- --- ---------&quot; for ((i=START; i&lt;=END; i++)) do echo $i | awk '{printf(&quot; %3d %2x %c\n&quot;, $1, $1, $1)}' # The Bash printf builtin will not work in this context: # printf &quot;%c&quot; &quot;$i&quot; done exit 0 # Decimal Hex Character # ------- --- --------- # 33 21 ! # 34 22 &quot; # 35 23 # # 36 24 $ # # . . . # # 122 7a z # 123 7b { # 124 7c | # 125 7d } # Redirect the output of this script to a file #+ or pipe it to &quot;more&quot;: sh pr-asc.sh | more Example 36-5. A shell wrapper around another awk script #!/bin/bash # Adds up a specified column (of numbers) in the target file. # Floating-point (decimal) numbers okay, because awk can handle them. ARGS=2 E_WRONGARGS=85 if [ $# -ne &quot;$ARGS&quot; ] # Check for proper number of command-line args. then echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` filename column-number&quot; exit $E_WRONGARGS fi filename=$1 column_number=$2 # Passing shell variables to the awk part of the script is a bit tricky. # One method is to strong-quote the Bash-script variable #+ within the awk script. # $'$BASH_SCRIPT_VAR' # ^ ^ # This is done in the embedded awk script below. # See the awk documentation for more details. # A multi-line awk script is here invoked by # awk ' # ... # ... # ... # ' # Begin awk script. # ----------------------------- awk ' { total += $'&quot;${column_number}&quot;' } END { print total } ' &quot;$filename&quot; # ----------------------------- # End awk script. # It may not be safe to pass shell variables to an embedded awk script, #+ so Stephane Chazelas proposes the following alternative: # --------------------------------------- # awk -v column_number=&quot;$column_number&quot; ' # { total += $column_number # } # END { # print total # }' &quot;$filename&quot; # --------------------------------------- exit 0 For those scripts needing a single do-it-all tool, a Swiss army knife, there is Perl. Perl combines the capabilities of sed and awk, and throws in a large subset of C, to boot. It is modular and contains support for everything ranging from object-oriented programming up to and including the kitchen sink. Short Perl scripts lend themselves to embedding within shell scripts, and there may be some substance to the claim that Perl can totally replace shell scripting (though the author of the ABS Guide remains skeptical). Example 36-6. Perl embedded in a Bash script #!/bin/bash # Shell commands may precede the Perl script. echo &quot;This precedes the embedded Perl script within \&quot;$0\&quot;.&quot; echo &quot;===============================================================&quot; perl -e 'print &quot;This line prints from an embedded Perl script.\n&quot;;' # Like sed, Perl also uses the &quot;-e&quot; option. echo &quot;===============================================================&quot; echo &quot;However, the script may also contain shell and system commands.&quot; exit 0 It is even possible to combine a Bash script and Perl script within the same file. Depending on how the script is invoked, either the Bash part or the Perl part will execute. Example 36-7. Bash and Perl scripts combined #!/bin/bash # bashandperl.sh echo &quot;Greetings from the Bash part of the script, $0.&quot; # More Bash commands may follow here. exit # End of Bash part of the script. # ======================================================= #!/usr/bin/perl # This part of the script must be invoked with # perl -x bashandperl.sh print &quot;Greetings from the Perl part of the script, $0.\n&quot;; # Perl doesn't seem to like &quot;echo&quot; ... # More Perl commands may follow here. # End of Perl part of the script. bash$ bash bashandperl.sh Greetings from the Bash part of the script. bash$ perl -x bashandperl.sh Greetings from the Perl part of the script. It is, of course, possible to embed even more exotic scripting languages within shell wrappers. Python, for example ... Example 36-8. Python embedded in a Bash script #!/bin/bash # ex56py.sh # Shell commands may precede the Python script. echo &quot;This precedes the embedded Python script within \&quot;$0.\&quot;&quot; echo &quot;===============================================================&quot; python -c 'print &quot;This line prints from an embedded Python script.\n&quot;;' # Unlike sed and perl, Python uses the &quot;-c&quot; option. python -c 'k = raw_input( &quot;Hit a key to exit to outer script. &quot; )' echo &quot;===============================================================&quot; echo &quot;However, the script may also contain shell and system commands.&quot; exit 0 Wrapping a script around mplayer and the Google's translation server, you can create something that talks back to you. Example 36-9. A script that speaks #!/bin/bash # Courtesy of: # http://elinux.org/RPi_Text_to_Speech_(Speech_Synthesis) # You must be on-line for this script to work, #+ so you can access the Google translation server. # Of course, mplayer must be present on your computer. speak() { local IFS=+ # Invoke mplayer, then connect to Google translation server. /usr/bin/mplayer -ao alsa -really-quiet -noconsolecontrols \ &quot;http://translate.google.com/translate_tts?tl=en&amp;q=&quot;$*&quot;&quot; # Google translates, but can also speak. } LINES=4 spk=$(tail -$LINES $0) # Tail end of same script! speak &quot;$spk&quot; exit # Browns. Nice talking to you. One interesting example of a complex shell wrapper is Martin Matusiak's undvd script, which provides an easy-to-use command-line interface to the complex mencoder utility. Another example is Itzchak Rehberg's Ext3Undel, a set of scripts to recover deleted file on an ext3 filesystem. 36.3. Tests and Comparisons: Alternatives For tests, the [[ ]] construct may be more appropriate than [ ]. Likewise, arithmetic comparisons might benefit from the (( )) construct. a=8 # All of the comparisons below are equivalent. test &quot;$a&quot; -lt 16 &amp;&amp; echo &quot;yes, $a &lt; 16&quot; # &quot;and list&quot; /bin/test &quot;$a&quot; -lt 16 &amp;&amp; echo &quot;yes, $a &lt; 16&quot; [ &quot;$a&quot; -lt 16 ] &amp;&amp; echo &quot;yes, $a &lt; 16&quot; [[ $a -lt 16 ]] &amp;&amp; echo &quot;yes, $a &lt; 16&quot; # Quoting variables within (( a &lt; 16 )) &amp;&amp; echo &quot;yes, $a &lt; 16&quot; # [[ ]] and (( )) not necessary. city=&quot;New York&quot; # Again, all of the comparisons below are equivalent. test &quot;$city&quot; \&lt; Paris &amp;&amp; echo &quot;Yes, Paris is greater than $city&quot; # Greater ASCII order. /bin/test &quot;$city&quot; \&lt; Paris &amp;&amp; echo &quot;Yes, Paris is greater than $city&quot; [ &quot;$city&quot; \&lt; Paris ] &amp;&amp; echo &quot;Yes, Paris is greater than $city&quot; [[ $city &lt; Paris ]] &amp;&amp; echo &quot;Yes, Paris is greater than $city&quot; # Need not quote $city. # Thank you, S.C. 36.4. Recursion: a script calling itself Can a script recursively call itself? Indeed. Example 36-10. A (useless) script that recursively calls itself #!/bin/bash # recurse.sh # Can a script recursively call itself? # Yes, but is this of any practical use? # (See the following.) RANGE=10 MAXVAL=9 i=$RANDOM let &quot;i %= $RANGE&quot; # Generate a random number between 0 and $RANGE - 1. if [ &quot;$i&quot; -lt &quot;$MAXVAL&quot; ] then echo &quot;i = $i&quot; ./$0 # Script recursively spawns a new instance of itself. fi # Each child script does the same, until #+ a generated $i equals $MAXVAL. # Using a &quot;while&quot; loop instead of an &quot;if/then&quot; test causes problems. # Explain why. exit 0 # Note: # ---- # This script must have execute permission for it to work properly. # This is the case even if it is invoked by an &quot;sh&quot; command. # Explain why. Example 36-11. A (useful) script that recursively calls itself #!/bin/bash # pb.sh: phone book # Written by Rick Boivie, and used with permission. # Modifications by ABS Guide author. MINARGS=1 # Script needs at least one argument. DATAFILE=./phonebook # A data file in current working directory #+ named &quot;phonebook&quot; must exist. PROGNAME=$0 E_NOARGS=70 # No arguments error. if [ $# -lt $MINARGS ]; then echo &quot;Usage: &quot;$PROGNAME&quot; data-to-look-up&quot; exit $E_NOARGS fi if [ $# -eq $MINARGS ]; then grep $1 &quot;$DATAFILE&quot; # 'grep' prints an error message if $DATAFILE not present. else ( shift; &quot;$PROGNAME&quot; $* ) | grep $1 # Script recursively calls itself. fi exit 0 # Script exits here. # Therefore, it's o.k. to put #+ non-hashmarked comments and data after this point. # ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Sample &quot;phonebook&quot; datafile: John Doe 1555 Main St., Baltimore, MD 21228 (410) 222-3333 Mary Moe 9899 Jones Blvd., Warren, NH 03787 (603) 898-3232 Richard Roe 856 E. 7th St., New York, NY 10009 (212) 333-4567 Sam Roe 956 E. 8th St., New York, NY 10009 (212) 444-5678 Zoe Zenobia 4481 N.

Example 36-12. Another (useful) script that recursively calls itself #!/bin/bash # usrmnt.sh, written by Anthony Richardson # Used in ABS Guide with permission. # usage: usrmnt.sh # description: mount device, invoking user must be listed in the # MNTUSERS group in the /etc/sudoers file. # ---------------------------------------------------------- # This is a usermount script that reruns itself using sudo. # A user with the proper permissions only has to type # usermount /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy # instead of # sudo usermount /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy # I use this same technique for all of my #+ sudo scripts, because I find it convenient. # ---------------------------------------------------------- # If SUDO_COMMAND variable is not set we are not being run through #+ sudo, so rerun ourselves. Pass the user's real and group id . . . if [ -z &quot;$SUDO_COMMAND&quot; ] then mntusr=$(id -u) grpusr=$(id -g) sudo $0 $* exit 0 fi # We will only get here if we are being run by sudo. /bin/mount $* -o uid=$mntusr,gid=$grpusr exit 0 # Additional notes (from the author of this script): # ------------------------------------------------- # 1) Linux allows the &quot;users&quot; option in the /etc/fstab # file so that any user can mount removable media. # But, on a server, I like to allow only a few # individuals access to removable media. # I find using sudo gives me more control. # 2) I also find sudo to be more convenient than # accomplishing this task through groups. # 3) This method gives anyone with proper permissions # root access to the mount command, so be careful # about who you allow access. # You can get finer control over which access can be mounted # by using this same technique in separate mntfloppy, mntcdrom, # and mntsamba scripts. Caution Too many levels of recursion can exhaust the script's stack space, causing a segfault. 36.5. &quot;Colorizing&quot; Scripts The ANSI [126] escape sequences set screen attributes, such as bold text, and color of foreground and background. DOS batch files commonly used ANSI escape codes for color output, and so can Bash scripts. Example 36-13.

The simplest, and perhaps most useful ANSI escape sequence is bold text, \033[1m ... \033[0m. The \033 represents an escape, the &quot;[1&quot; turns on the bold attribute, while the &quot;[0&quot; switches it off. The &quot;m&quot; terminates each term of the escape sequence. bash$ echo -e &quot;\033[1mThis is bold text.\033[0m&quot; A similar escape sequence switches on the underline attribute (on an rxvt and an aterm). bash$ echo -e &quot;\033[4mThis is underlined text.\033[0m&quot; Note With an echo, the -e option enables the escape sequences. Other escape sequences change the text and/or background color. bash$ echo -e '\E[34;47mThis prints in blue.'; tput sgr0 bash$ echo -e '\E[33;44m'&quot;yellow text on blue background&quot;; tput sgr0 bash$ echo -e '\E[1;33;44m'&quot;BOLD yellow text on blue background&quot;; tput sgr0 Note It's usually advisable to set the bold attribute for light-colored foreground text. The tput sgr0 restores the terminal settings to normal. Omitting this lets all subsequent output from that particular terminal remain blue. Note Since tput sgr0 fails to restore terminal settings under certain circumstances, echo -ne \E[0m may be a better choice. Use the following template for writing colored text on a colored background. echo -e '\E[COLOR1;COLOR2mSome text goes here.' The &quot;\E[&quot; begins the escape sequence. The semicolon-separated numbers &quot;COLOR1&quot; and &quot;COLOR2&quot; specify a foreground and a background color, according to the table below. (The order of the numbers does not matter, since the foreground and background numbers fall in non-overlapping ranges.) The &quot;m&quot; terminates the escape sequence, and the text begins immediately after that. Note also that single quotes enclose the remainder of the command sequence following the echo -e. The numbers in the following table work for an rxvt terminal. Results may vary for other terminal emulators. Table 36-1.

Caution There is, however, a major problem with all this. ANSI escape sequences are emphatically non-portable. What works fine on some terminal emulators (or the console) may work differently, or not at all, on others. A &quot;colorized&quot; script that looks stunning on the script author's machine may produce unreadable output on someone else's. This somewhat compromises the usefulness of colorizing scripts, and possibly relegates this technique to the status of a gimmick. Colorized scripts are probably inappropriate in a commercial setting, i.e., your supervisor might disapprove. Alister's ansi-color utility (based on Moshe Jacobson's color utility considerably simplifies using ANSI escape sequences. It substitutes a clean and logical syntax for the clumsy constructs just discussed. Henry/teikedvl has likewise created a utility (http://scriptechocolor.sourceforge.net/) to simplify creation of colorized scripts. 36.6. Optimizations Most shell scripts are quick 'n dirty solutions to non-complex problems. As such, optimizing them for speed is not much of an issue. Consider the case, though, where a script carries out an important task, does it well, but runs too slowly. Rewriting it in a compiled language may not be a palatable option. The simplest fix would be to rewrite the parts of the script that slow it down. Is it possible to apply principles of code optimization even to a lowly shell script? Check the loops in the script. Time consumed by repetitive operations adds up quickly. If at all possible, remove time-consuming operations from within loops. Use builtin commands in preference to system commands. Builtins execute faster and usually do not launch a subshell when invoked. Avoid unnecessary commands, particularly in a pipe. cat &quot;$file&quot; | grep &quot;$word&quot; grep &quot;$word&quot; &quot;$file&quot; # The above command-lines have an identical effect, #+ but the second runs faster since it launches one fewer subprocess. The cat command seems especially prone to overuse in scripts. Disabling certain Bash options can speed up scripts. As Erik Brandsberg points out: If you don't need Unicode support, you can get potentially a 2x or more improvement in speed by simply setting the LC_ALL variable. export LC_ALL=C [specifies the locale as ANSI C, thereby disabling Unicode support] [In an example script ...] Without [Unicode support]: erik@erik-desktop:~/capture$ time ./cap-ngrep.sh live2.pcap &gt; out.txt real 0m20.483s user 1m34.470s sys 0m12.869s With [Unicode support]: erik@erik-desktop:~/capture$ time ./cap-ngrep.sh live2.pcap &gt; out.txt real 0m50.232s user 3m51.118s sys 0m11.221s A large part of the overhead that is optimized is, I believe, regex match using [[ string =~ REGEX ]], but it may help with other portions of the code as well. I hadn't [seen it] mentioned that this optimization helped with Bash, but I had seen it helped with &quot;grep,&quot; so why not try? Note Certain operators, notably expr, are very inefficient and might be replaced by double parentheses arithmetic expansion. See Example A-59. Math tests math via $(( )) real 0m0.294s user 0m0.288s sys 0m0.008s math via expr: real 1m17.879s # Much slower! user 0m3.600s sys 0m8.765s math via let: real 0m0.364s user 0m0.372s sys 0m0.000s Condition testing constructs in scripts deserve close scrutiny. Substitute case for if-then constructs and combine tests when possible, to minimize script execution time. Again, refer to Example A-59.

When overwriting values in a numeric array, there is a significant performance penalty vs. associative arrays. Running a test script confirms this. See Example A-60.

Consider rewriting time-critical code sections in C, or even in assembler. Try to minimize file I/O. Bash is not particularly efficient at handling files, so consider using more appropriate tools for this within the script, such as awk or Perl. Write your scripts in a modular and coherent form, [127] so they can be reorganized and tightened up as necessary. Some of the optimization techniques applicable to high-level languages may work for scripts, but others, such as loop unrolling, are mostly irrelevant. Above all, use common sense. For an excellent demonstration of how optimization can dramatically reduce the execution time of a script, see Example 16-47. 36.7. Assorted Tips 36.7.1. Ideas for more powerful scripts You have a problem that you want to solve by writing a Bash script. Unfortunately, you don't know quite where to start. One method is to plunge right in and code those parts of the script that come easily, and write the hard parts as pseudo-code. #!/bin/bash ARGCOUNT=1 # Need name as argument. E_WRONGARGS=65 if [ number-of-arguments is-not-equal-to &quot;$ARGCOUNT&quot; ] # ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ # Can't figure out how to code this . . . #+ . . . so write it in pseudo-code. then echo &quot;Usage: name-of-script name&quot; # ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ More pseudo-code. exit $E_WRONGARGS fi . . . exit 0 # Later on, substitute working code for the pseudo-code. # Line 6 becomes: if [ $# -ne &quot;$ARGCOUNT&quot; ] # Line 12 becomes: echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` name&quot; For an example of using pseudo-code, see the Square Root exercise. To keep a record of which user scripts have run during a particular session or over a number of sessions, add the following lines to each script you want to keep track of. This will keep a continuing file record of the script names and invocation times. # Append (&gt;&gt;) following to end of each script tracked. whoami&gt;&gt; $SAVE_FILE # User invoking the script. echo $0&gt;&gt; $SAVE_FILE # Script name. date&gt;&gt; $SAVE_FILE # Date and time. echo&gt;&gt; $SAVE_FILE # Blank line as separator. # Of course, SAVE_FILE defined and exported as environmental variable in ~/.bashrc #+ (something like ~/.scripts-run) The &gt;&gt; operator appends lines to a file. What if you wish to prepend a line to an existing file, that is, to paste it in at the beginning? file=data.txt title=&quot;***This is the title line of data text file***&quot; echo $title | cat - $file &gt;$file.new # &quot;cat -&quot; concatenates stdout to $file. # End result is #+ to write a new file with $title appended at *beginning*. This is a simplified variant of the Example 19-13 script given earlier. And, of course, sed can also do this. A shell script may act as an embedded command inside another shell script, a Tcl or wish script, or even a Makefile. It can be invoked as an external shell command in a C program using the system() call, i.e., system(&quot;script_name&quot;);. Setting a variable to the contents of an embedded sed or awk script increases the readability of the surrounding shell wrapper. See Example A-1 and Example 15-20. Put together files containing your favorite and most useful definitions and functions. As necessary, &quot;include&quot; one or more of these &quot;library files&quot; in scripts with either the dot (.) or source command. # SCRIPT LIBRARY # ------ ------- # Note: # No &quot;#!&quot; here. # No &quot;live code&quot; either. # Useful variable definitions ROOT_UID=0 # Root has $UID 0.

Example 36-17. A Progress Bar #!/bin/bash # progress-bar.sh # Author: Dotan Barak (very minor revisions by ABS Guide author). # Used in ABS Guide with permission (thanks!).

MAX_PERCENT=100 for ((i=0; i&lt;=MAX_PERCENT; i++)); do # usleep 10000 # ... Or run some other commands ... # print_progress_bar ${BAR_WIDTH} ${i} echo -en &quot;\r&quot; done echo &quot;&quot; exit A particularly clever use of if-test constructs is for comment blocks. #!/bin/bash COMMENT_BLOCK= # Try setting the above variable to some value #+ for an unpleasant surprise. if [ $COMMENT_BLOCK ]; then Comment block -- ================================= This is a comment line. This is another comment line. This is yet another comment line. ================================= echo &quot;This will not echo.&quot; Comment blocks are error-free! Whee! fi echo &quot;No more comments, please.&quot; exit 0 Compare this with using here documents to comment out code blocks. Using the $? exit status variable, a script may test if a parameter contains only digits, so it can be treated as an integer. #!/bin/bash SUCCESS=0 E_BADINPUT=85 test &quot;$1&quot; -ne 0 -o &quot;$1&quot; -eq 0 2&gt;/dev/null # An integer is either equal to 0 or not equal to 0. # 2&gt;/dev/null suppresses error message. if [ $? -ne &quot;$SUCCESS&quot; ] then echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` integer-input&quot; exit $E_BADINPUT fi let &quot;sum = $1 + 25&quot; # Would give error if $1 not integer. echo &quot;Sum = $sum&quot; # Any variable, not just a command-line parameter, can be tested this way. exit 0 The 0 - 255 range for function return values is a severe limitation. Global variables and other workarounds are often problematic. An alternative method for a function to communicate a value back to the main body of the script is to have the function write to stdout (usually with echo) the &quot;return value,&quot; and assign this to a variable. This is actually a variant of command substitution. Example 36-18. Return value trickery #!/bin/bash # multiplication.sh multiply () # Multiplies params passed. { # Will accept a variable number of args. local product=1 until [ -z &quot;$1&quot; ] # Until uses up arguments passed... do let &quot;product *= $1&quot; shift done echo $product # Will not echo to stdout, } #+ since this will be assigned to a variable. mult1=15383; mult2=25211 val1=`multiply $mult1 $mult2` # Assigns stdout (echo) of function to the variable val1. echo &quot;$mult1 X $mult2 = $val1&quot; # 387820813 mult1=25; mult2=5; mult3=20 val2=`multiply $mult1 $mult2 $mult3` echo &quot;$mult1 X $mult2 X $mult3 = $val2&quot; # 2500 mult1=188; mult2=37; mult3=25; mult4=47 val3=`multiply $mult1 $mult2 $mult3 $mult4` echo &quot;$mult1 X $mult2 X $mult3 X $mult4 = $val3&quot; # 8173300 exit 0 The same technique also works for alphanumeric strings. This means that a function can &quot;return&quot; a non-numeric value. capitalize_ichar () # Capitalizes initial character { #+ of argument string(s) passed. string0=&quot;$@&quot; # Accepts multiple arguments. firstchar=${string0:0:1} # First character. string1=${string0:1} # Rest of string(s). FirstChar=`echo &quot;$firstchar&quot; | tr a-z A-Z` # Capitalize first character. echo &quot;$FirstChar$string1&quot; # Output to stdout. } newstring=`capitalize_ichar &quot;every sentence should start with a capital letter.&quot;` echo &quot;$newstring&quot; # Every sentence should start with a capital letter. It is even possible for a function to &quot;return&quot; multiple values with this method. Example 36-19. Even more return value trickery #!/bin/bash # sum-product.sh # A function may &quot;return&quot; more than one value. sum_and_product () # Calculates both sum and product of passed args. { echo $(( $1 + $2 )) $(( $1 * $2 )) # Echoes to stdout each calculated value, separated by space. } echo echo &quot;Enter first number &quot; read first echo echo &quot;Enter second number &quot; read second echo retval=`sum_and_product $first $second` # Assigns output of function. sum=`echo &quot;$retval&quot; | awk '{print $1}'` # Assigns first field. product=`echo &quot;$retval&quot; | awk '{print $2}'` # Assigns second field. echo &quot;$first + $second = $sum&quot; echo &quot;$first * $second = $product&quot; echo exit 0 Caution There can be only one echo statement in the function for this to work. If you alter the previous example: sum_and_product () { echo &quot;This is the sum_and_product function.&quot; # This messes things up! echo $(( $1 + $2 )) $(( $1 * $2 )) } ... retval=`sum_and_product $first $second` # Assigns output of function. # Now, this will not work correctly. Next in our bag of tricks are techniques for passing an array to a function, then &quot;returning&quot; an array back to the main body of the script. Passing an array involves loading the space-separated elements of the array into a variable with command substitution. Getting an array back as the &quot;return value&quot; from a function uses the previously mentioned strategem of echoing the array in the function, then invoking command substitution and the ( ... ) operator to assign it to an array. Example 36-20. Passing and returning arrays #!/bin/bash # array-function.sh: Passing an array to a function and ... # &quot;returning&quot; an array from a function Pass_Array () { local passed_array # Local variable! passed_array=( `echo &quot;$1&quot;` ) echo &quot;${passed_array[@]}&quot; # List all the elements of the new array #+ declared and set within the function. } original_array=( element1 element2 element3 element4 element5 ) echo echo &quot;original_array = ${original_array[@]}&quot; # List all elements of original array. # This is the trick that permits passing an array to a function. # ********************************** argument=`echo ${original_array[@]}` # ********************************** # Pack a variable #+ with all the space-separated elements of the original array. # # Attempting to just pass the array itself will not work. # This is the trick that allows grabbing an array as a &quot;return value&quot;. # ***************************************** returned_array=( `Pass_Array &quot;$argument&quot;` ) # ***************************************** # Assign 'echoed' output of function to array variable. echo &quot;returned_array = ${returned_array[@]}&quot; echo &quot;=============================================================&quot; # Now, try it again, #+ attempting to access (list) the array from outside the function. Pass_Array &quot;$argument&quot; # The function itself lists the array, but ... #+ accessing the array from outside the function is forbidden. echo &quot;Passed array (within function) = ${passed_array[@]}&quot; # NULL VALUE since the array is a variable local to the function. echo ############################################ # And here is an even more explicit example: ret_array () { for element in {11..20} do echo &quot;$element &quot; # Echo individual elements done #+ of what will be assembled into an array. } arr=( $(ret_array) ) # Assemble into array. echo &quot;Capturing array \&quot;arr\&quot; from function ret_array () ...&quot; echo &quot;Third element of array \&quot;arr\&quot; is ${arr[2]}.&quot; # 13 (zero-indexed) echo -n &quot;Entire array is: &quot; echo ${arr[@]} # 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 echo exit 0 # Nathan Coulter points out that passing arrays with elements containing #+ whitespace breaks this example. For a more elaborate example of passing arrays to functions, see Example A-10. Using the double-parentheses construct, it is possible to use C-style syntax for setting and incrementing/decrementing variables and in for and while loops. See Example 11-13 and Example 11-18. Setting the path and umask at the beginning of a script makes it more portable -- more likely to run on a &quot;foreign&quot; machine whose user may have bollixed up the $PATH and umask. #!/bin/bash PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin ; export PATH umask 022 # Files that the script creates will have 755 permission. # Thanks to Ian D. Allen, for this tip. A useful scripting technique is to repeatedly feed the output of a filter (by piping) back to the same filter, but with a different set of arguments and/or options. Especially suitable for this are tr and grep. # From &quot;wstrings.sh&quot; example. wlist=`strings &quot;$1&quot; | tr A-Z a-z | tr '[:space:]' Z | \ tr -cs '[:alpha:]' Z | tr -s '\173-\377' Z | tr Z ' '` Example 36-21.

See also Example 29-4, Example 16-25, and Example A-9. Use &quot;anonymous here documents&quot; to comment out blocks of code, to save having to individually comment out each line with a #. See Example 19-11. Running a script on a machine that relies on a command that might not be installed is dangerous. Use whatis to avoid potential problems with this. CMD=command1 # First choice. PlanB=command2 # Fallback option. command_test=$(whatis &quot;$CMD&quot; | grep 'nothing appropriate') # If 'command1' not found on system , 'whatis' will return #+ &quot;command1: nothing appropriate.&quot; # # A safer alternative is: # command_test=$(whereis &quot;$CMD&quot; | grep \/) # But then the sense of the following test would have to be reversed, #+ since the $command_test variable holds content only if #+ the $CMD exists on the system. # (Thanks, bojster.) if [[ -z &quot;$command_test&quot; ]] # Check whether command present. then $CMD option1 option2 # Run command1 with options. else # Otherwise, $PlanB #+ run command2. fi An if-grep test may not return expected results in an error case, when text is output to stderr, rather that stdout. if ls -l nonexistent_filename | grep -q 'No such file or directory' then echo &quot;File \&quot;nonexistent_filename\&quot; does not exist.&quot; fi Redirecting stderr to stdout fixes this. if ls -l nonexistent_filename 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep -q 'No such file or directory' # ^^^^ then echo &quot;File \&quot;nonexistent_filename\&quot; does not exist.&quot; fi # Thanks, Chris Martin, for pointing this out. If you absolutely must access a subshell variable outside the subshell, here's a way to do it. TMPFILE=tmpfile # Create a temp file to store the variable. ( # Inside the subshell ... inner_variable=Inner echo $inner_variable echo $inner_variable &gt;&gt;$TMPFILE # Append to temp file. ) # Outside the subshell ... echo; echo &quot;-----&quot;; echo echo $inner_variable # Null, as expected. echo &quot;-----&quot;; echo # Now ... read inner_variable &lt;$TMPFILE # Read back shell variable. rm -f &quot;$TMPFILE&quot; # Get rid of temp file. echo &quot;$inner_variable&quot; # It's an ugly kludge, but it works. The run-parts command is handy for running a set of command scripts in a particular sequence, especially in combination with cron or at. For doing multiple revisions on a complex script, use the rcs Revision Control System package. Among other benefits of this is automatically updated ID header tags. The co command in rcs does a parameter replacement of certain reserved key words, for example, replacing # $Id$ in a script with something like: # $Id: hello-world.sh,v 1.1 2004/10/16 02:43:05 bozo Exp $ 36.7.2. Widgets It would be nice to be able to invoke X-Windows widgets from a shell script. There happen to exist several packages that purport to do so, namely Xscript, Xmenu, and widtools. The first two of these no longer seem to be maintained. Fortunately, it is still possible to obtain widtools here. Caution The widtools (widget tools) package requires the XForms library to be installed. Additionally, the Makefile needs some judicious editing before the package will build on a typical Linux system. Finally, three of the six widgets offered do not work (and, in fact, segfault). The dialog family of tools offers a method of calling &quot;dialog&quot; widgets from a shell script. The original dialog utility works in a text console, but its successors, gdialog, Xdialog, and kdialog use X-Windows-based widget sets. Example 36-22. Widgets invoked from a shell script #!/bin/bash # dialog.sh: Using 'gdialog' widgets. # Must have 'gdialog' installed on your system to run this script. # Or, you can replace all instance of 'gdialog' below with 'kdialog' ... # Version 1.1 (corrected 04/05/05) # This script was inspired by the following article. # &quot;Scripting for X Productivity,&quot; by Marco Fioretti, # LINUX JOURNAL, Issue 113, September 2003, pp. 86-9. # Thank you, all you good people at LJ. # Input error in dialog box.

The xmessage command is a simple method of popping up a message/query window. For example: xmessage Fatal error in script! -button exit The latest entry in the widget sweepstakes is zenity. This utility pops up GTK+ dialog widgets-and-windows, and it works very nicely within a script. get_info () { zenity --entry # Pops up query window . . . #+ and prints user entry to stdout. # Also try the --calendar and --scale options. } answer=$( get_info ) # Capture stdout in $answer variable. echo &quot;User entered: &quot;$answer&quot;&quot; For other methods of scripting with widgets, try Tk or wish (Tcl derivatives), PerlTk (Perl with Tk extensions), tksh (ksh with Tk extensions), XForms4Perl (Perl with XForms extensions), Gtk-Perl (Perl with Gtk extensions), or PyQt (Python with Qt extensions). 36.8. Security Issues 36.8.1. Infected Shell Scripts A brief warning about script security is indicated. A shell script may contain a worm, trojan, or even a virus. For that reason, never run as root a script (or permit it to be inserted into the system startup scripts in /etc/rc.d) unless you have obtained said script from a trusted source or you have carefully analyzed it to make certain it does nothing harmful. Various researchers at Bell Labs and other sites, including M. Douglas McIlroy, Tom Duff, and Fred Cohen have investigated the implications of shell script viruses. They conclude that it is all too easy for even a novice, a &quot;script kiddie,&quot; to write one. [128] Here is yet another reason to learn scripting. Being able to look at and understand scripts may protect your system from being compromised by a rogue script. 36.8.2. Hiding Shell Script Source For security purposes, it may be necessary to render a script unreadable. If only there were a utility to create a stripped binary executable from a script. Francisco Rosales' shc -- generic shell script compiler does exactly that. Unfortunately, according to an article in the October, 2005 Linux Journal, the binary can, in at least some cases, be decrypted to recover the original script source. Still, this could be a useful method of keeping scripts secure from all but the most skilled hackers. 36.8.3. Writing Secure Shell Scripts Dan Stromberg suggests the following guidelines for writing (relatively) secure shell scripts. Don't put secret data in environment variables. Don't pass secret data in an external command's arguments (pass them in via a pipe or redirection instead). Set your $PATH carefully. Don't just trust whatever path you inherit from the caller if your script is running as root. In fact, whenever you use an environment variable inherited from the caller, think about what could happen if the caller put something misleading in the variable, e.g., if the caller set $HOME to /etc. 36.9. Portability Issues It is easier to port a shell than a shell script. --Larry Wall This book deals specifically with Bash scripting on a GNU/Linux system. All the same, users of sh and ksh will find much of value here. As it happens, many of the various shells and scripting languages seem to be converging toward the POSIX 1003.2 standard. Invoking Bash with the --posix option or inserting a set -o posix at the head of a script causes Bash to conform very closely to this standard. Another alternative is to use a #!/bin/sh sha-bang header in the script, rather than #!/bin/bash. [129] Note that /bin/sh is a link to /bin/bash in Linux and certain other flavors of UNIX, and a script invoked this way disables extended Bash functionality. Most Bash scripts will run as-is under ksh, and vice-versa, since Chet Ramey has been busily porting ksh features to the latest versions of Bash. On a commercial UNIX machine, scripts using GNU-specific features of standard commands may not work. This has become less of a problem in the last few years, as the GNU utilities have pretty much displaced their proprietary counterparts even on &quot;big-iron&quot; UNIX. Caldera's release of the source to many of the original UNIX utilities has accelerated the trend. Bash has certain features that the traditional Bourne shell lacks. Among these are: Certain extended invocation options Command substitution using $( ) notation Brace expansion Certain array operations, and associative arrays The double brackets extended test construct The double-parentheses arithmetic-evaluation construct Certain string manipulation operations Process substitution A Regular Expression matching operator Bash-specific builtins Coprocesses See the Bash F.A.Q. for a complete listing. 36.9.1. A Test Suite Let us illustrate some of the incompatibilities between Bash and the classic Bourne shell. Download and install the &quot;Heirloom Bourne Shell&quot; and run the following script, first using Bash, then the classic sh. Example 36-23. Test Suite #!/bin/bash # test-suite.sh # A partial Bash compatibility test suite. # Run this on your version of Bash, or some other shell. default_option=FAIL # Tests below will fail unless . . . echo echo -n &quot;Testing &quot; sleep 1; echo -n &quot;. &quot; sleep 1; echo -n &quot;. &quot; sleep 1; echo &quot;. &quot; echo # Double brackets String=&quot;Double brackets supported?&quot; echo -n &quot;Double brackets test: &quot; if [[ &quot;$String&quot; = &quot;Double brackets supported?&quot; ]] then echo &quot;PASS&quot; else echo &quot;FAIL&quot; fi # Double brackets and regex matching String=&quot;Regex matching supported?&quot; echo -n &quot;Regex matching: &quot; if [[ &quot;$String&quot; =~ R.....matching* ]] then echo &quot;PASS&quot; else echo &quot;FAIL&quot; fi # Arrays test_arr=$default_option # FAIL Array=( If supports arrays will print PASS ) test_arr=${Array[5]} echo &quot;Array test: $test_arr&quot; # Command Substitution csub_test () { echo &quot;PASS&quot; } test_csub=$default_option # FAIL test_csub=$(csub_test) echo &quot;Command substitution test: $test_csub&quot; echo # Completing this script is an exercise for the reader. # Add to the above similar tests for double parentheses, #+ brace expansion, process substitution, etc. exit $? 36.10. Shell Scripting Under Windows Even users running that other OS can run UNIX-like shell scripts, and therefore benefit from many of the lessons of this book. The Cygwin package from Cygnus and the MKS utilities from Mortice Kern Associates add shell scripting capabilities to Windows. Another alternative is UWIN, written by David Korn of AT&amp;T, of Korn Shell fame. In 2006, Microsoft released the Windows Powershell®, which contains limited Bash-like command-line scripting capabilities. Chapter 37. Bash, versions 2, 3, and 4 37.1. Bash, version 2 The current version of Bash, the one you have running on your machine, is most likely version 2.xx.yy, 3.xx.yy, or 4.xx.yy. bash$ echo $BASH_VERSION 3.2.25(1)-release The version 2 update of the classic Bash scripting language added array variables, string and parameter expansion, and a better method of indirect variable references, among other features. Example 37-1. String expansion #!/bin/bash # String expansion. # Introduced with version 2 of Bash. # Strings of the form $'xxx' #+ have the standard escaped characters interpreted. echo $'Ringing bell 3 times \a \a \a' # May only ring once with certain terminals. # Or ... # May not ring at all, depending on terminal settings. echo $'Three form feeds \f \f \f' echo $'10 newlines \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n' echo $'\102\141\163\150' # B a s h # Octal equivalent of characters. exit Example 37-2. Indirect variable references - the new way #!/bin/bash # Indirect variable referencing. # This has a few of the attributes of references in C++. a=letter_of_alphabet letter_of_alphabet=z echo &quot;a = $a&quot; # Direct reference. echo &quot;Now a = ${!a}&quot; # Indirect reference. # The ${!variable} notation is more intuitive than the old #+ eval var1=\$$var2 echo t=table_cell_3 table_cell_3=24 echo &quot;t = ${!t}&quot; # t = 24 table_cell_3=387 echo &quot;Value of t changed to ${!t}&quot; # 387 # No 'eval' necessary. # This is useful for referencing members of an array or table, #+ or for simulating a multi-dimensional array. # An indexing option (analogous to pointer arithmetic) #+ would have been nice.

Bash, version 3 On July 27, 2004, Chet Ramey released version 3 of Bash. This update fixed quite a number of bugs and added new features. Some of the more important added features: A new, more generalized {a..z} brace expansion operator. #!/bin/bash for i in {1..10} # Simpler and more straightforward than #+ for i in $(seq 10) do echo -n &quot;$i &quot; done echo # 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 # Or just . . . echo {a..z} # a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z echo {e..m} # e f g h i j k l m echo {z..a} # z y x w v u t s r q p o n m l k j i h g f e d c b a # Works backwards, too. echo {25..30} # 25 26 27 28 29 30 echo {3..-2} # 3 2 1 0 -1 -2 echo {X..d} # X Y Z [ ] ^ _ ` a b c d # Shows (some of) the ASCII characters between Z and a, #+ but don't rely on this type of behavior because . . . echo {]..a} # {]..a} # Why? # You can tack on prefixes and suffixes. echo &quot;Number #&quot;{1..4}, &quot;...&quot; # Number #1, Number #2, Number #3, Number #4, ... # You can concatenate brace-expansion sets. echo {1..3}{x..z}&quot; +&quot; &quot;...&quot; # 1x + 1y + 1z + 2x + 2y + 2z + 3x + 3y + 3z + ... # Generates an algebraic expression. # This could be used to find permutations. # You can nest brace-expansion sets. echo {{a..c},{1..3}} # a b c 1 2 3 # The &quot;comma operator&quot; splices together strings. # ########## ######### ############ ########### ######### ############### # Unfortunately, brace expansion does not lend itself to parameterization. var1=1 var2=5 echo {$var1..$var2} # {1..5} # Yet, as Emiliano G. points out, using &quot;eval&quot; overcomes this limitation. start=0 end=10 for index in $(eval echo {$start..$end}) do echo -n &quot;$index &quot; # 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 done echo The ${!array[@]} operator, which expands to all the indices of a given array. #!/bin/bash Array=(element-zero element-one element-two element-three) echo ${Array[0]} # element-zero # First element of array. echo ${!Array[@]} # 0 1 2 3 # All the indices of Array. for i in ${!Array[@]} do echo ${Array[i]} # element-zero # element-one # element-two # element-three # # All the elements in Array. done The =~ Regular Expression matching operator within a double brackets test expression. (Perl has a similar operator.) #!/bin/bash variable=&quot;This is a fine mess.&quot; echo &quot;$variable&quot; # Regex matching with =~ operator within [[ double brackets ]]. if [[ &quot;$variable&quot; =~ T.........fin*es* ]] # NOTE: As of version 3.2 of Bash, expression to match no longer quoted. then echo &quot;match found&quot; # match found fi Or, more usefully: #!/bin/bash input=$1 if [[ &quot;$input&quot; =~ &quot;[0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]&quot; ]] # ^ NOTE: Quoting not necessary, as of version 3.2 of Bash. # NNN-NN-NNNN (where each N is a digit). then echo &quot;Social Security number.&quot; # Process SSN. else echo &quot;Not a Social Security number!&quot; # Or, ask for corrected input. fi For additional examples of using the =~ operator, see Example A-29, Example 19-14, Example A-35, and Example A-24. The new set -o pipefail option is useful for debugging pipes. If this option is set, then the exit status of a pipe is the exit status of the last command in the pipe to fail (return a non-zero value), rather than the actual final command in the pipe. See Example 16-43. Caution The update to version 3 of Bash breaks a few scripts that worked under earlier versions. Test critical legacy scripts to make sure they still work! As it happens, a couple of the scripts in the Advanced Bash Scripting Guide had to be fixed up (see Example 9-4, for instance). 37.2.1. Bash, version 3.1 The version 3.1 update of Bash introduces a number of bugfixes and a few minor changes. The += operator is now permitted in in places where previously only the = assignment operator was recognized. a=1 echo $a # 1 a+=5 # Won't work under versions of Bash earlier than 3.1. echo $a # 15 a+=Hello echo $a # 15Hello Here, += functions as a string concatenation operator. Note that its behavior in this particular context is different than within a let construct. a=1 echo $a # 1 let a+=5 # Integer arithmetic, rather than string concatenation. echo $a # 6 let a+=Hello # Doesn't &quot;add&quot; anything to a. echo $a # 6 Jeffrey Haemer points out that this concatenation operator can be quite useful. In this instance, we append a directory to the $PATH. bash$ echo $PATH /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin/:/usr/games bash$ PATH+=:/opt/bin bash$ echo $PATH /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin/:/usr/games:/opt/bin 37.2.2. Bash, version 3.2 This is pretty much a bugfix update. In global parameter substitutions, the pattern no longer anchors at the start of the string. The --wordexp option disables process substitution. The =~ Regular Expression match operator no longer requires quoting of the pattern within [[ ... ]]. Caution In fact, quoting in this context is not advisable as it may cause regex evaluation to fail. Chet Ramey states in the Bash FAQ that quoting explicitly disables regex evaluation. See also the Ubuntu Bug List and Wikinerds on Bash syntax. Setting shopt -s compat31 in a script causes reversion to the original behavior. 37.3. Bash, version 4 Chet Ramey announced Version 4 of Bash on the 20th of February, 2009. This release has a number of significant new features, as well as some important bugfixes. Among the new goodies: Associative arrays. [130] An associative array can be thought of as a set of two linked arrays -- one holding the data, and the other the keys that index the individual elements of the data array. Example 37-5. A simple address database #!/bin/bash4 # fetch_address.sh declare -A address # -A option declares associative array. address[Charles]=&quot;414 W. 10th Ave., Baltimore, MD 21236&quot; address[John]=&quot;202 E. 3rd St., New York, NY 10009&quot; address[Wilma]=&quot;1854 Vermont Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90023&quot; echo &quot;Charles's address is ${address[Charles]}.&quot; # Charles's address is 414 W. 10th Ave., Baltimore, MD 21236. echo &quot;Wilma's address is ${address[Wilma]}.&quot; # Wilma's address is 1854 Vermont Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90023. echo &quot;John's address is ${address[John]}.&quot; # John's address is 202 E. 3rd St., New York, NY 10009. echo echo &quot;${!address[*]}&quot; # The array indices ... # Charles John Wilma Example 37-6. A somewhat more elaborate address database #!/bin/bash4 # fetch_address-2.sh # A more elaborate version of fetch_address.sh. SUCCESS=0 E_DB=99 # Error code for missing entry. declare -A address # -A option declares associative array. store_address () { address[$1]=&quot;$2&quot; return $? } fetch_address () { if [[ -z &quot;${address[$1]}&quot; ]] then echo &quot;$1's address is not in database.&quot; return $E_DB fi echo &quot;$1's address is ${address[$1]}.&quot; return $? } store_address &quot;Lucas Fayne&quot; &quot;414 W. 13th Ave., Baltimore, MD 21236&quot; store_address &quot;Arvid Boyce&quot; &quot;202 E. 3rd St., New York, NY 10009&quot; store_address &quot;Velma Winston&quot; &quot;1854 Vermont Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90023&quot; # Exercise: # Rewrite the above store_address calls to read data from a file, #+ then assign field 1 to name, field 2 to address in the array. # Each line in the file would have a format corresponding to the above. # Use a while-read loop to read from file, sed or awk to parse the fields. fetch_address &quot;Lucas Fayne&quot; # Lucas Fayne's address is 414 W. 13th Ave., Baltimore, MD 21236. fetch_address &quot;Velma Winston&quot; # Velma Winston's address is 1854 Vermont Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90023. fetch_address &quot;Arvid Boyce&quot; # Arvid Boyce's address is 202 E. 3rd St., New York, NY 10009. fetch_address &quot;Bozo Bozeman&quot; # Bozo Bozeman's address is not in database. exit $? # In this case, exit code = 99, since that is function return. See Example A-53 for an interesting usage of an associative array. Caution Elements of the index array may include embedded space characters, or even leading and/or trailing space characters. However, index array elements containing only whitespace are not permitted. address[ ]=&quot;Blank&quot; # Error! Enhancements to the case construct: the ;;&amp; and ;&amp; terminators. Example 37-7. Testing characters #!/bin/bash4 test_char () { case &quot;$1&quot; in [[:print:]] ) echo &quot;$1 is a printable character.&quot;;;&amp; # | # The ;;&amp; terminator continues to the next pattern test. | [[:alnum:]] ) echo &quot;$1 is an alpha/numeric character.&quot;;;&amp; # v [[:alpha:]] ) echo &quot;$1 is an alphabetic character.&quot;;;&amp; # v [[:lower:]] ) echo &quot;$1 is a lowercase alphabetic character.&quot;;;&amp; [[:digit:]] ) echo &quot;$1 is an numeric character.&quot;;&amp; # | # The ;&amp; terminator executes the next statement ... # | %%%@@@@@ ) echo &quot;********************************&quot;;; # v # ^^^^^^^^ ... even with a dummy pattern. esac } echo test_char 3 # 3 is a printable character. # 3 is an alpha/numeric character. # 3 is an numeric character. # ******************************** echo test_char m # m is a printable character. # m is an alpha/numeric character. # m is an alphabetic character. # m is a lowercase alphabetic character. echo test_char / # / is a printable character. echo # The ;;&amp; terminator can save complex if/then conditions. # The ;&amp; is somewhat less useful. The new coproc builtin enables two parallel processes to communicate and interact. As Chet Ramey states in the Bash FAQ [131] , ver. 4.01: There is a new 'coproc' reserved word that specifies a coprocess: an asynchronous command run with two pipes connected to the creating shell. Coprocs can be named. The input and output file descriptors and the PID of the coprocess are available to the calling shell in variables with coproc-specific names. George Dimitriu explains, &quot;... coproc ... is a feature used in Bash process substitution, which now is made publicly available.&quot; This means it can be explicitly invoked in a script, rather than just being a behind-the-scenes mechanism used by Bash. Coprocesses use file descriptors. File descriptors enable processes and pipes to communicate. #!/bin/bash4 # A coprocess communicates with a while-read loop. coproc { cat mx_data.txt; sleep 2; } # ^^^^^^^ # Try running this without &quot;sleep 2&quot; and see what happens. while read -u ${COPROC[0]} line # ${COPROC[0]} is the do #+ file descriptor of the coprocess. echo &quot;$line&quot; | sed -e 's/line/NOT-ORIGINAL-TEXT/' done kill $COPROC_PID # No longer need the coprocess, #+ so kill its PID. But, be careful! #!/bin/bash4 echo; echo a=aaa b=bbb c=ccc coproc echo &quot;one two three&quot; while read -u ${COPROC[0]} a b c; # Note that this loop do #+ runs in a subshell. echo &quot;Inside while-read loop: &quot;; echo &quot;a = $a&quot;; echo &quot;b = $b&quot;; echo &quot;c = $c&quot; echo &quot;coproc file descriptor: ${COPROC[0]}&quot; done # a = one # b = two # c = three # So far, so good, but ... echo &quot;-----------------&quot; echo &quot;Outside while-read loop: &quot; echo &quot;a = $a&quot; # a = echo &quot;b = $b&quot; # b = echo &quot;c = $c&quot; # c = echo &quot;coproc file descriptor: ${COPROC[0]}&quot; echo # The coproc is still running, but ... #+ it still doesn't enable the parent process #+ to &quot;inherit&quot; variables from the child process, the while-read loop. # Compare this to the &quot;badread.sh&quot; script. Caution The coprocess is asynchronous, and this might cause a problem. It may terminate before another process has finished communicating with it. #!/bin/bash4 coproc cpname { for i in {0..10}; do echo &quot;index = $i&quot;; done; } # ^^^^^^ This is a *named* coprocess. read -u ${cpname[0]} echo $REPLY # index = 0 echo ${COPROC[0]} #+ No output ... the coprocess timed out # after the first loop iteration. # However, George Dimitriu has a partial fix. coproc cpname { for i in {0..10}; do echo &quot;index = $i&quot;; done; sleep 1; echo hi &gt; myo; cat - &gt;&gt; myo; } # ^^^^^ This is a *named* coprocess. echo &quot;I am main&quot;$'\04' &gt;&amp;${cpname[1]} myfd=${cpname[0]} echo myfd=$myfd ### while read -u $myfd ### do ### echo $REPLY; ### done echo $cpname_PID # Run this with and without the commented-out while-loop, and it is #+ apparent that each process, the executing shell and the coprocess, #+ waits for the other to finish writing in its own write-enabled pipe. The new mapfile builtin makes it possible to load an array with the contents of a text file without using a loop or command substitution. #!/bin/bash4 mapfile Arr1 &lt; $0 # Same result as Arr1=( $(cat $0) ) echo &quot;${Arr1[@]}&quot; # Copies this entire script out to stdout. echo &quot;--&quot;; echo # But, not the same as read -a !!! read -a Arr2 &lt; $0 echo &quot;${Arr2[@]}&quot; # Reads only first line of script into the array. exit The read builtin got a minor facelift. The -t timeout option now accepts (decimal) fractional values [132] and the -i option permits preloading the edit buffer. [133] Unfortunately, these enhancements are still a work in progress and not (yet) usable in scripts. Parameter substitution gets case-modification operators. #!/bin/bash4 var=veryMixedUpVariable echo ${var} # veryMixedUpVariable echo ${var^} # VeryMixedUpVariable # * First char --&gt; uppercase. echo ${var^^} # VERYMIXEDUPVARIABLE # ** All chars --&gt; uppercase. echo ${var,} # veryMixedUpVariable # * First char --&gt; lowercase. echo ${var,,} # verymixedupvariable # ** All chars --&gt; lowercase. The declare builtin now accepts the -l lowercase and -c capitalize options. #!/bin/bash4 declare -l var1 # Will change to lowercase var1=MixedCaseVARIABLE echo &quot;$var1&quot; # mixedcasevariable # Same effect as echo $var1 | tr A-Z a-z declare -c var2 # Changes only initial char to uppercase. var2=originally_lowercase echo &quot;$var2&quot; # Originally_lowercase # NOT the same effect as echo $var2 | tr a-z A-Z Brace expansion has more options. Increment/decrement, specified in the final term within braces. #!/bin/bash4 echo {40..60..2} # 40 42 44 46 48 50 52 54 56 58 60 # All the even numbers, between 40 and 60. echo {60..40..2} # 60 58 56 54 52 50 48 46 44 42 40 # All the even numbers, between 40 and 60, counting backwards. # In effect, a decrement. echo {60..40..-2} # The same output. The minus sign is not necessary. # But, what about letters and symbols? echo {X..d} # X Y Z [ ] ^ _ ` a b c d # Does not echo the \ which escapes a space.

Coprocesses? Whatever happened to the lean and mean Bash we have come to know and love? Could it be suffering from (horrors!) &quot;feature creep&quot;? Or perhaps even Korn shell envy? Note to Chet Ramey: Please add only essential features in future Bash releases -- perhaps for-each loops and support for multi-dimensional arrays. [134] Most Bash users won't need, won't use, and likely won't greatly appreciate complex &quot;features&quot; like built-in debuggers, Perl interfaces, and bolt-on rocket boosters. 37.3.1. Bash, version 4.1 Version 4.1 of Bash, released in May, 2010, was primarily a bugfix update. The printf command now accepts a -v option for setting array indices. Within double brackets, the &gt; and &lt; string comparison operators now conform to the locale. Since the locale setting may affect the sorting order of string expressions, this has side-effects on comparison tests within [[ ... ]] expressions. The read builtin now takes a -N option (read -N chars), which causes the read to terminate after chars characters. Example 37-8.

Bash, version 4.2 Version 4.2 of Bash, released in February, 2011, contains a number of new features and enhancements, in addition to bugfixes. Bash now supports the the \u and \U Unicode escape. Unicode is a cross-platform standard for encoding into numerical values letters and graphic symbols. This permits representing and displaying characters in foreign alphabets and unusual fonts. echo -e '\u2630' # Horizontal triple bar character. # Equivalent to the more roundabout: echo -e &quot;\xE2\x98\xB0&quot; # Recognized by earlier Bash versions. echo -e '\u220F' # PI (Greek letter and mathematical symbol) echo -e '\u0416' # Capital &quot;ZHE&quot; (Cyrillic letter) echo -e '\u2708' # Airplane (Dingbat font) symbol echo -e '\u2622' # Radioactivity trefoil echo -e &quot;The amplifier circuit requires a 100 \u2126 pull-up resistor.&quot; unicode_var='\u2640' echo -e $unicode_var # Female symbol printf &quot;$unicode_var \n&quot; # Female symbol, with newline # And for something a bit more elaborate . . . # We can store Unicode symbols in an associative array, #+ then retrieve them by name. # Run this in a gnome-terminal or a terminal with a large, bold font #+ for better legibility. declare -A symbol # Associative array. symbol[script_E]='\u2130' symbol[script_F]='\u2131' symbol[script_J]='\u2110' symbol[script_M]='\u2133' symbol[Rx]='\u211E' symbol[TEL]='\u2121' symbol[FAX]='\u213B' symbol[care_of]='\u2105' symbol[account]='\u2100' symbol[trademark]='\u2122' echo -ne &quot;${symbol[script_E]} &quot; echo -ne &quot;${symbol[script_F]} &quot; echo -ne &quot;${symbol[script_J]} &quot; echo -ne &quot;${symbol[script_M]} &quot; echo -ne &quot;${symbol[Rx]} &quot; echo -ne &quot;${symbol[TEL]} &quot; echo -ne &quot;${symbol[FAX]} &quot; echo -ne &quot;${symbol[care_of]} &quot; echo -ne &quot;${symbol[account]} &quot; echo -ne &quot;${symbol[trademark]} &quot; echo Note The above example uses the $' ... ' string-expansion construct. When the lastpipe shell option is set, the last command in a pipe doesn't run in a subshell. Example 37-10. Piping input to a read #!/bin/bash # lastpipe-option.sh line='' # Null value. echo &quot;\$line = &quot;$line&quot;&quot; # $line = echo shopt -s lastpipe # Error on Bash version -lt 4.2. echo &quot;Exit status of attempting to set \&quot;lastpipe\&quot; option is $?&quot; # 1 if Bash version -lt 4.2, 0 otherwise. echo head -1 $0 | read line # Pipe the first line of the script to read. # ^^^^^^^^^ Not in a subshell!!! echo &quot;\$line = &quot;$line&quot;&quot; # Older Bash releases $line = # Bash version 4.2 $line = #!/bin/bash This option offers possible &quot;fixups&quot; for these example scripts: Example 34-3 and Example 15-8. Negative array indices permit counting backwards from the end of an array. Example 37-11. Negative array indices #!/bin/bash # neg-array.sh # Requires Bash, version -ge 4.2. array=( zero one two three four five ) # Six-element array. # 0 1 2 3 4 5 # -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 # Negative array indices now permitted. echo ${array[-1]} # five echo ${array[-2]} # four # ... echo ${array[-6]} # zero # Negative array indices count backward from the last element+1. # But, you cannot index past the beginning of the array. echo ${array[-7]} # array: bad array subscript # So, what is this new feature good for? echo &quot;The last element in the array is &quot;${array[-1]}&quot;&quot; # Which is quite a bit more straightforward than: echo &quot;The last element in the array is &quot;${array[${#array[*]}-1]}&quot;&quot; echo # And ... index=0 let &quot;neg_element_count = 0 - ${#array[*]}&quot; # Number of elements, converted to a negative number. while [ $index -gt $neg_element_count ]; do ((index--)); echo -n &quot;${array[index]} &quot; done # Lists the elements in the array, backwards. # We have just simulated the &quot;tac&quot; command on this array. echo # See also neg-offset.sh. Substring extraction uses a negative length parameter to specify an offset from the end of the target string. Example 37-12. Negative parameter in string-extraction construct #!/bin/bash # Bash, version -ge 4.2 # Negative length-index in substring extraction. # Important: It changes the interpretation of this construct! stringZ=abcABC123ABCabc echo ${stringZ} # abcABC123ABCabc # Position within string: 0123456789..... echo ${stringZ:2:3} # cAB # Count 2 chars forward from string beginning, and extract 3 chars. # ${string:position:length} # So far, nothing new, but now ... # abcABC123ABCabc # Position within string: 0123....6543210 echo ${stringZ:3:-6} # ABC123 # ^ # Index 3 chars forward from beginning and 6 chars backward from end, #+ and extract everything in between. # ${string:offset-from-front:offset-from-end} # When the &quot;length&quot; parameter is negative, #+ it serves as an offset-from-end parameter. # See also neg-array.sh. Chapter 38. Endnotes 38.1. Author's Note doce ut discas (Teach, that you yourself may learn.) How did I come to write a scripting book? It's a strange tale. It seems that a few years back I needed to learn shell scripting -- and what better way to do that than to read a good book on the subject? I was looking to buy a tutorial and reference covering all aspects of the subject. I was looking for a book that would take difficult concepts, turn them inside out, and explain them in excruciating detail, with well-commented examples. [135] In fact, I was looking for this very book, or something very much like it. Unfortunately, it didn't exist, and if I wanted it, I'd have to write it. And so, here we are, folks. That reminds me of the apocryphal story about a mad professor. Crazy as a loon, the fellow was. At the sight of a book, any book -- at the library, at a bookstore, anywhere -- he would become totally obsessed with the idea that he could have written it, should have written it -- and done a better job of it to boot. He would thereupon rush home and proceed to do just that, write a book with the very same title. When he died some years later, he allegedly had several thousand books to his credit, probably putting even Asimov to shame. The books might not have been any good, who knows, but does that really matter? Here's a fellow who lived his dream, even if he was obsessed by it, driven by it . . . and somehow I can't help admiring the old coot. 38.2. About the Author Who is this guy anyhow? The author claims no credentials or special qualifications, [136] other than a compulsion to write. [137] This book is somewhat of a departure from his other major work, HOW-2 Meet Women: The Shy Man's Guide to Relationships. He has also written the Software-Building HOWTO. Of late, he has been trying his (heavy) hand at fiction: Dave Dawson Over Berlin (First Installment) Dave Dawson Over Berlin (Second Installment) and Dave Dawson Over Berlin (Third Installment) . He also has a few Instructables (here, here, here, here, here, here, and here to his (dis)credit. A Linux user since 1995 (Slackware 2.2, kernel 1.2.1), the author has emitted a few software truffles, including the cruft one-time pad encryption utility, the mcalc mortgage calculator, the judge Scrabble® adjudicator, the yawl word gaming list package, and the Quacky anagramming gaming package. He got off to a rather shaky start in the computer game -- programming FORTRAN IV on a CDC 3800 (on paper coding pads, with occasional forays on a keypunch machine and a Friden Flexowriter) -- and is not the least bit nostalgic for those days. Living in an out-of-the-way community with wife and orange tabby, he cherishes human frailty, especially his own. [138] 38.3. Where to Go For Help The author is no longer supporting or updating this document. He will not answer questions about this book or about general scripting topics. If you need assistance with a schoolwork assignment, read the pertinent sections of this and other reference works. Do your best to solve the problem using your own wits and resources. Please do not waste the author's time. You will get neither help nor sympathy. [139] Likewise, kindly refrain from annoying the author with solicitations, offers of employment, or &quot;business opportunities.&quot; He is doing just fine, and requires neither help nor sympathy, thank you. Please note that the author will not answer scripting questions for Sun/Solaris/Oracle or Apple systems. The endarkened execs and the arachnoid corporate attorneys of those particular outfits have been using litigation in a predatory manner and/or as a weapon against the Open Source Community. Any Solaris or Apple users needing scripting help will therefore kindly direct their concerns to corporate customer service. ... sophisticated in mechanism but possibly agile operating under noises being extremely suppressed ... --CI-300 printer manual 38.4. Tools Used to Produce This Book 38.4.1. Hardware A used IBM Thinkpad, model 760XL laptop (P166, 104 meg RAM) running Red Hat 7.1/7.3. Sure, it's slow and has a funky keyboard, but it beats the heck out of a No. 2 pencil and a Big Chief tablet. Update: upgraded to a 770Z Thinkpad (P2-366, 192 meg RAM) running FC3. Anyone feel like donating a later-model laptop to a starving writer &lt;g&gt;? Update: upgraded to a T61 Thinkpad running Mandriva 2011. No longer starving &lt;g&gt;, but not too proud to accept donations. 38.4.2. Software and Printware Bram Moolenaar's powerful SGML-aware vim text editor. OpenJade, a DSSSL rendering engine for converting SGML documents into other formats. Norman Walsh's DSSSL stylesheets. DocBook, The Definitive Guide, by Norman Walsh and Leonard Muellner (O'Reilly, ISBN 1-56592-580-7). This is still the standard reference for anyone attempting to write a document in Docbook SGML format. 38.5. Credits Community participation made this project possible. The author gratefully acknowledges that writing this book would have been unthinkable without help and feedback from all you people out there. Philippe Martin translated the first version (0.1) of this document into DocBook/SGML. While not on the job at a small French company as a software developer, he enjoys working on GNU/Linux documentation and software, reading literature, playing music, and, for his peace of mind, making merry with friends. You may run across him somewhere in France or in the Basque Country, or you can email him at feloy@free.fr. Philippe Martin also pointed out that positional parameters past $9 are possible using {bracket} notation. (See Example 4-5). Stéphane Chazelas sent a long list of corrections, additions, and example scripts. More than a contributor, he had, in effect, for a while taken on the role of co-editor for this document. Merci beaucoup! Paulo Marcel Coelho Aragao offered many corrections, both major and minor, and contributed quite a number of helpful suggestions. I would like to especially thank Patrick Callahan, Mike Novak, and Pal Domokos for catching bugs, pointing out ambiguities, and for suggesting clarifications and changes in the preliminary version (0.1) of this document. Their lively discussion of shell scripting and general documentation issues inspired me to try to make this document more readable. I'm grateful to Jim Van Zandt for pointing out errors and omissions in version 0.2 of this document. He also contributed an instructive example script. Many thanks to Jordi Sanfeliu for giving permission to use his fine tree script (Example A-16), and to Rick Boivie for revising it. Likewise, thanks to Michel Charpentier for permission to use his dc factoring script (Example 16-52). Kudos to Noah Friedman for permission to use his string function script (Example A-18). Emmanuel Rouat suggested corrections and additions on command substitution, aliases, and path management. He also contributed a very nice sample .bashrc file (Appendix M). Heiner Steven kindly gave permission to use his base conversion script, Example 16-48. He also made a number of corrections and many helpful suggestions. Special thanks. Rick Boivie contributed the delightfully recursive pb.sh script (Example 36-11), revised the tree.sh script (Example A-16), and suggested performance improvements for the monthlypmt.sh script (Example 16-47). Florian Wisser enlightened me on some of the fine points of testing strings (see Example 7-6), and on other matters. Oleg Philon sent suggestions concerning cut and pidof. Michael Zick extended the empty array example to demonstrate some surprising array properties. He also contributed the isspammer scripts (Example 16-41 and Example A-28). Marc-Jano Knopp sent corrections and clarifications on DOS batch files. Hyun Jin Cha found several typos in the document in the process of doing a Korean translation. Thanks for pointing these out. Andreas Abraham sent in a long list of typographical errors and other corrections. Special thanks!

Thanks and appreciation to IBM, Red Hat, Google, the Free Software Foundation, and all the good people fighting the good fight to keep Open Source software free and open. Belated thanks to my fourth grade teacher, Miss Spencer, for emotional support and for convincing me that maybe, just maybe I wasn't a total loss. Thanks most of all to my wife, Anita, for her encouragement, inspiration, and emotional support. 38.6. Disclaimer (This is a variant of the standard LDP disclaimer.)

Rather than being a conversion from a printed volume, it was specifically designed and formatted for viewing on an ebook reader. Well-written, informative, and useful as a reference as well as a tutorial. Highly recommended. * Dale Dougherty and Arnold Robbins, Sed and Awk, 2nd edition, O'Reilly and Associates, 1997, 1-156592-225-5. Unfolding the full power of shell scripting requires at least a passing familiarity with sed and awk. This is the classic tutorial. It includes an excellent introduction to Regular Expressions. Recommended. * Jeffrey Friedl, Mastering Regular Expressions, O'Reilly and Associates, 2002, 0-596-00289-0.

Contains a couple of sections of very informative in-depth articles on shell programming, but falls short of being a self-teaching manual. It reproduces much of the Regular Expressions tutorial from the Dougherty and Robbins book, above. The comprehensive coverage of UNIX commands makes this book worthy of a place on your bookshelf. * Clifford Pickover, Computers, Pattern, Chaos, and Beauty, St. Martin's Press, 1990, 0-312-04123-3.

Distinguishing files by their name is just so 20th Century. The content is distinguished by computing a checksum of that content. This version uses the md5sum program to generate a 128 bit checksum representative of the file's contents. There is a chance that two files having different content might generate the same checksum using md5sum (or any checksum). Should that become a problem, then the use of md5sum can be replace by a cyrptographic signature. But until then... The md5sum program is documented as outputting three fields (and it does), but when read it appears as two fields (array elements). This is caused by the lack of whitespace between the second and third field. So this function gropes the md5sum output and returns: [0] 32 character checksum in hexidecimal (UCFS filename) [1] Single character: ' ' text file, '*' binary file [2] Filesystem (20th Century Style) name Note: That name may be the character '-' indicating STDIN read.

Or goto &quot;Quickstart&quot; at end of script. Provides Given a domain name or IP(v4) address as input: Does an exhaustive set of queries to find the associated network resources (short of recursing into TLDs). Checks the IP(v4) addresses found against Blacklist nameservers. If found to be a blacklisted IP(v4) address, reports the blacklist text records. (Usually hyper-links to the specific report.) Requires A working Internet connection. (Exercise: Add check and/or abort if not on-line when running script.) Bash with arrays (2.05b+). The external program 'dig' -- a utility program provided with the 'bind' set of programs. Specifically, the version which is part of Bind series 9.x See: http://www.isc.org All usages of 'dig' are limited to wrapper functions, which may be rewritten as required. See: dig_wrappers.bash for details. (&quot;Additional documentation&quot; -- below) Usage Script requires a single argument, which may be: 1) A domain name; 2) An IP(v4) address; 3) A filename, with one name or address per line. Script accepts an optional second argument, which may be: 1) A Blacklist server name; 2) A filename, with one Blacklist server name per line. If the second argument is not provided, the script uses a built-in set of (free) Blacklist servers. See also, the Quickstart at the end of this script (after 'exit'). Return Codes 0 - All OK 1 - Script failure 2 - Something is Blacklisted Optional environment variables SPAMMER_TRACE If set to a writable file, script will log an execution flow trace. SPAMMER_DATA If set to a writable file, script will dump its discovered data in the form of GraphViz file. See: http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz SPAMMER_LIMIT Limits the depth of resource tracing. Default is 2 levels. A setting of 0 (zero) means 'unlimited' . . . Caution: script might recurse the whole Internet! A limit of 1 or 2 is most useful when processing a file of domain names and addresses. A higher limit can be useful when hunting spam gangs. Additional documentation Download the archived set of scripts explaining and illustrating the function contained within this script. http://bash.deta.in/mszick_clf.tar.bz2 Study notes This script uses a large number of functions. Nearly all general functions have their own example script. Each of the example scripts have tutorial level comments. Scripting project Add support for IP(v6) addresses. IP(v6) addresses are recognized but not processed. Advanced project Add the reverse lookup detail to the discovered information. Report the delegation chain and abuse contacts.

Requires the external program 'dig' from the 'bind-9' set of DNS programs. See: http://www.isc.org The domain name lookup depth limit defaults to 2 levels. Set the environment variable SPAMMER_LIMIT to change. SPAMMER_LIMIT=0 means 'unlimited' Limit may also be set on the command-line. If arg#1 is an integer, the limit is set to that value and then the above argument rules are applied. Setting the environment variable 'SPAMMER_DATA' to a filename will cause the script to write a GraphViz graphic file.

Array support is included by default Bash configurations. 'dig,' version 9.x.x (dig $HOSTNAME, see first line of output) A version of dig which supports the +short options. See: dig_wrappers.bash for details. Optional Prerequisites 'named,' a local DNS caching program. Any flavor will do. Do twice: dig $HOSTNAME Check near bottom of output for: SERVER: 127.0.0.1#53 That means you have one running. Optional Graphics Support 'date,' a standard *nix thing. (date -R) dot Program to convert graphic description file to a diagram. (dot -V) A part of the Graph-Viz set of programs. See: [http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz||GraphViz] 'dotty,' a visual editor for graphic description files. Also a part of the Graph-Viz set of programs. Quick Start In the same directory as the is_spammer.bash script; Do: ./is_spammer.bash Usage Details 1. Blacklist server choices. (a) To use default, built-in list: Do nothing. (b) To use your own list: i. Create a file with a single Blacklist server domain name per line. ii. Provide that filename as the last argument to the script. (c) To use a single Blacklist server: Last argument to the script. (d) To disable Blacklist lookups: i. Create an empty file (touch spammer.nul) Your choice of filename. ii. Provide the filename of that empty file as the last argument to the script. 2. Search depth limit. (a) To use the default value of 2: Do nothing. (b) To set a different limit: A limit of 0 means: no limit. i. export SPAMMER_LIMIT=1 or whatever limit you want. ii. OR provide the desired limit as the first argument to the script. 3. Optional execution trace log. (a) To use the default setting of no log output: Do nothing. (b) To write an execution trace log: export SPAMMER_TRACE=spammer.log or whatever filename you want. 4. Optional graphic description file. (a) To use the default setting of no graphic file: Do nothing. (b) To write a Graph-Viz graphic description file: export SPAMMER_DATA=spammer.dot or whatever filename you want. 5. Where to start the search. (a) Starting with a single domain name: i. Without a command-line search limit: First argument to script. ii. With a command-line search limit: Second argument to script. (b) Starting with a single IP address: i. Without a command-line search limit: First argument to script. ii. With a command-line search limit: Second argument to script. (c) Starting with (mixed) multiple name(s) and/or address(es): Create a file with one name or address per line. Your choice of filename. i. Without a command-line search limit: Filename as first argument to script. ii. With a command-line search limit: Filename as second argument to script. 6. What to do with the display output. (a) To view display output on screen: Do nothing. (b) To save display output to a file: Redirect stdout to a filename. (c) To discard display output: Redirect stdout to /dev/null. 7. Temporary end of decision making. press RETURN wait (optionally, watch the dots and colons). 8. Optionally check the return code. (a) Return code 0: All OK (b) Return code 1: Script setup failure (c) Return code 2: Something was blacklisted. 9. Where is my graph (diagram)? The script does not directly produce a graph (diagram). It only produces a graphic description file. You can process the graphic descriptor file that was output with the 'dot' program. Until you edit that descriptor file, to describe the relationships you want shown, all that you will get is a bunch of labeled name and address nodes. All of the script's discovered relationships are within a comment block in the graphic descriptor file, each with a descriptive heading. The editing required to draw a line between a pair of nodes from the information in the descriptor file may be done with a text editor. Given these lines somewhere in the descriptor file: # Known domain name nodes N0000 [label=&quot;guardproof.info.&quot;] ; N0002 [label=&quot;third.guardproof.info.&quot;] ; # Known address nodes A0000 [label=&quot;61.141.32.197&quot;] ; /* # Known name-&gt;address edges NA0000 third.guardproof.info. 61.141.32.197 # Known parent-&gt;child edges PC0000 guardproof.info. third.guardproof.info. */ Turn that into the following lines by substituting node identifiers into the relationships: # Known domain name nodes N0000 [label=&quot;guardproof.info.&quot;] ; N0002 [label=&quot;third.guardproof.info.&quot;] ; # Known address nodes A0000 [label=&quot;61.141.32.197&quot;] ; # PC0000 guardproof.info. third.guardproof.info. N0000-&gt;N0002 ; # NA0000 third.guardproof.info. 61.141.32.197 N0002-&gt;A0000 ; /* # Known name-&gt;address edges NA0000 third.guardproof.info. 61.141.32.197 # Known parent-&gt;child edges PC0000 guardproof.info. third.guardproof.info. */ Process that with the 'dot' program, and you have your first network diagram. In addition to the conventional graphic edges, the descriptor file includes similar format pair-data that describes services, zone records (sub-graphs?), blacklisted addresses, and other things which might be interesting to include in your graph. This additional information could be displayed as different node shapes, colors, line sizes, etc. The descriptor file can also be read and edited by a Bash script (of course). You should be able to find most of the functions required within the &quot;is_spammer.bash&quot; script. # End Quickstart.

Fixups by Little Monster. # 02/02/2005. Minor additions by Little Monster. # (See after # +++++++++++ ) # 29/01/2005. Minor stylistic edits and cleanups by author of ABS Guide. # Added exit error codes. # 22/11/2004. Finished initial version of second version of wgetter: # wgetter2 is born. # 01/12/2004. Changed 'runn' function so it can be run 2 ways -- # either ask for a file name or have one input on the CL. # 01/12/2004. Made sensible handling of no URL's given. # 01/12/2004. Made loop of main options, so you don't # have to keep calling wgetter 2 all the time. # Runs as a session instead. # 01/12/2004. Added looping to 'runn' function. # Simplified and improved. # 01/12/2004. Added state to recursion setting. # Enables re-use of previous value. # 05/12/2004. Modified the file detection routine in the 'runn' function # so it's not fooled by empty values, and is cleaner. # 01/02/2004. Added cookie finding routine from later version (which # isn't ready yet), so as not to have hard-coded paths. # ======================================================================= # Error codes for abnormal exit.

Realtime Software Pty Ltd. Released under GNU license. Free to use. Please pass any modifications or comments to the author Phil Braham: realtime@mpx.com.au ======================================================================= cdll is a replacement for cd and incorporates similar functionality to the bash pushd and popd commands but is independent of them. This version of cdll has been tested on Linux using Bash. It will work on most Linux versions but will probably not work on other shells without modification. Introduction ============ cdll allows easy moving about between directories. When changing to a new directory the current one is automatically put onto a stack. By default 50 entries are kept, but this is configurable. Special directories can be kept for easy access - by default up to 10, but this is configurable. The most recent stack entries and the special entries can be easily viewed. The directory stack and special entries can be saved to, and loaded from, a file. This allows them to be set up on login, saved before logging out or changed when moving project to project. In addition, cdll provides a flexible command prompt facility that allows, for example, a directory name in colour that is truncated from the left if it gets too long. Setting up cdll =============== Copy cdll to either your local home directory or a central directory such as /usr/bin (this will require root access). Copy the file cdfile to your home directory. It will require read and write access. This a default file that contains a directory stack and special entries. To replace the cd command you must add commands to your login script. The login script is one or more of: /etc/profile ~/.bash_profile ~/.bash_login ~/.profile ~/.bashrc /etc/bash.bashrc.local To setup your login, ~/.bashrc is recommended, for global (and root) setup add the commands to /etc/bash.bashrc.local To set up on login, add the command: . &lt;dir&gt;/cdll For example if cdll is in your local home directory: . ~/cdll If in /usr/bin then: . /usr/bin/cdll If you want to use this instead of the buitin cd command then add: alias cd='cd_new' We would also recommend the following commands: alias @='cd_new @' cd -U cd -D If you want to use cdll's prompt facilty then add the following: CDL_PROMPTLEN=nn Where nn is a number described below. Initially 99 would be suitable number. Thus the script looks something like this: ###################################################################### # CD Setup ###################################################################### CDL_PROMPTLEN=21 # Allow a prompt length of up to 21 characters . /usr/bin/cdll # Initialise cdll alias cd='cd_new' # Replace the built in cd command alias @='cd_new @' # Allow @ at the prompt to display history cd -U # Upload directories cd -D # Set default action to non-posix ###################################################################### The full meaning of these commands will become clear later. There are a couple of caveats. If another program changes the directory without calling cdll, then the directory won't be put on the stack and also if the prompt facility is used then this will not be updated. Two programs that can do this are pushd and popd. To update the prompt and stack simply enter: cd . Note that if the previous entry on the stack is the current directory then the stack is not updated. Usage ===== cd [dir] [0-9] [@[s|h] [-g &lt;dir&gt;] [-d] [-D] [-r&lt;n&gt;] [dir|0-9] [-R&lt;n&gt;] [&lt;dir&gt;|0-9] [-s&lt;n&gt;] [-S&lt;n&gt;] [-u] [-U] [-f] [-F] [-h] [-H] [-v] &lt;dir&gt; Go to directory 0-n Goto previous directory (0 is previous, 1 is last but 1, etc.) n is up to max history (default is 50) @ List history and special entries (Usually available as $ @) @h List history entries @s List special entries -g [&lt;dir&gt;] Go to literal name (bypass special names) This is to allow access to dirs called '0','1','-h' etc -d Change default action - verbose. (See note) -D Change default action - silent. (See note) -s&lt;n&gt; Go to the special entry &lt;n&gt; -S&lt;n&gt; Go to the special entry &lt;n&gt; and replace it with the current dir -r&lt;n&gt; [&lt;dir&gt;] Go to directory &lt;dir&gt; and then put it on special entry &lt;n&gt; -R&lt;n&gt; [&lt;dir&gt;] Go to directory &lt;dir&gt; and put current dir on special entry &lt;n&gt; -a&lt;n&gt; Alternative suggested directory. See note below. -f [&lt;file&gt;] File entries to &lt;file&gt;. -u [&lt;file&gt;] Update entries from &lt;file&gt;. If no filename supplied then default file (~/cdfile) is used -F and -U are silent versions -v Print version number -h Help -H Detailed help Examples ======== These examples assume non-default mode is set (that is, cd with no parameters will go to the most recent stack directory), that aliases have been set up for cd and @ as described above and that cd's prompt facility is active and the prompt length is 21 characters. /home/phil$ @ # List the entries with the @ History: # Output of the @ command ..... # Skipped these entries for brevity 1 /home/phil/ummdev S1 /home/phil/perl # Most recent two history entries 0 /home/phil/perl/eg S0 /home/phil/umm/ummdev # and two special entries are shown /home/phil$ cd /home/phil/utils/Cdll # Now change directories /home/phil/utils/Cdll$ @ # Prompt reflects the directory. History: # New history ..... 1 /home/phil/perl/eg S1 /home/phil/perl # History entry 0 has moved to 1 0 /home/phil S0 /home/phil/umm/ummdev # and the most recent has entered To go to a history entry: /home/phil/utils/Cdll$ cd 1 # Go to history entry 1. /home/phil/perl/eg$ # Current directory is now what was 1 To go to a special entry: /home/phil/perl/eg$ cd -s1 # Go to special entry 1 /home/phil/umm/ummdev$ # Current directory is S1 To go to a directory called, for example, 1: /home/phil$ cd -g 1 # -g ignores the special meaning of 1 /home/phil/1$ To put current directory on the special list as S1: cd -r1 . # OR cd -R1 . # These have the same effect if the directory is #+ . (the current directory) To go to a directory and add it as a special The directory for -r&lt;n&gt; or -R&lt;n&gt; may be a number. For example: $ cd -r3 4 Go to history entry 4 and put it on special entry 3 $ cd -R3 4 Put current dir on the special entry 3 and go to history entry 4 $ cd -s3 Go to special entry 3 Note that commands R,r,S and s may be used without a number and refer to 0: $ cd -s Go to special entry 0 $ cd -S Go to special entry 0 and make special entry 0 current dir $ cd -r 1 Go to history entry 1 and put it on special entry 0 $ cd -r Go to history entry 0 and put it on special entry 0 Alternative suggested directories: If a directory is not found, then CD will suggest any possibilities. These are directories starting with the same letters and if any are found they are listed prefixed with -a&lt;n&gt; where &lt;n&gt; is a number. It's possible to go to the directory by entering cd -a&lt;n&gt; on the command line. Use cd -d or -D to change default cd action. cd -H will show current action. The history entries (0-n) are stored in the environment variables CD[0] - CD[n] Similarly the special directories S0 - 9 are in the environment variable CDS[0] - CDS[9] and may be accessed from the command line, for example: ls -l ${CDS[3]} cat ${CD[8]}/file.txt The default pathname for the -f and -u commands is ~ The default filename for the -f and -u commands is cdfile Configuration ============= The following environment variables can be set: CDL_PROMPTLEN - Set to the length of prompt you require. Prompt string is set to the right characters of the current directory. If not set, then prompt is left unchanged. Note that this is the number of characters that the directory is shortened to, not the total characters in the prompt. CDL_PROMPT_PRE - Set to the string to prefix the prompt. Default is: non-root: &quot;\\[\\e[01;34m\\]&quot; (sets colour to blue). root: &quot;\\[\\e[01;31m\\]&quot; (sets colour to red). CDL_PROMPT_POST - Set to the string to suffix the prompt. Default is: non-root: &quot;\\[\\e[00m\\]$&quot; (resets colour and displays $). root: &quot;\\[\\e[00m\\]#&quot; (resets colour and displays #). Note: CDL_PROMPT_PRE &amp; _POST only t CDPath - Set the default path for the -f &amp; -u options. Default is home directory CDFile - Set the default filename for the -f &amp; -u options. Default is cdfile There are three variables defined in the file cdll which control the number of entries stored or displayed. They are in the section labeled 'Initialisation here' towards the end of the file. cd_maxhistory - The number of history entries stored. Default is 50. cd_maxspecial - The number of special entries allowed. Default is 9. cd_histcount - The number of history and special entries displayed. Default is 9. Note that cd_maxspecial should be &gt;= cd_histcount to avoid displaying special entries that can't be set. Version: 1.2.1 Date: 24-MAY-2003 DOCUMENTATION Example A-34.

The rules are the same, but the scoring is simplified and plurals of previously played words are allowed. &quot;Vulnerable&quot; play is not yet implemented, but it is otherwise feature-complete. As the game begins, the player gets 10 letters. The object is to construct valid dictionary words of at least 3-letter length from the letterset. Each word-length category -- 3-letter, 4-letter, 5-letter, ... -- fills up with the fifth word entered, and no further words in that category are accepted. The penalty for too-short (two-letter), duplicate, unconstructable, and invalid (not in dictionary) words is -200. The same penalty applies to attempts to enter a word in a filled-up category. INSTRUCTION1 echo -n &quot;Hit ENTER for next page of instructions. &quot;; read az1 cat &lt;&lt;INSTRUCTION2 The scoring mostly corresponds to classic Perquackey: The first 3-letter word scores 60, plus 10 for each additional one. The first 4-letter word scores 120, plus 20 for each additional one. The first 5-letter word scores 200, plus 50 for each additional one. The first 6-letter word scores 300, plus 100 for each additional one. The first 7-letter word scores 500, plus 150 for each additional one. The first 8-letter word scores 750, plus 250 for each additional one. The first 9-letter word scores 1000, plus 500 for each additional one. The first 10-letter word scores 2000, plus 2000 for each additional one. Category completion bonuses are: 3-letter words 100 4-letter words 200 5-letter words 400 6-letter words 800 7-letter words 2000 8-letter words 10000 This is a simplification of the absurdly baroque Perquackey bonus scoring system. INSTRUCTION2 echo -n &quot;Hit ENTER for final page of instructions. &quot;; read az1 cat &lt;&lt;INSTRUCTION3 Hitting just ENTER for a word entry ends the game. Individual word entry is timed to a maximum of 10 seconds. *** Timing out on an entry ends the game. *** Aside from that, the game is untimed. -------------------------------------------------- Game statistics are automatically saved to a file. -------------------------------------------------- For competitive (&quot;duplicate&quot;) play, a previous letterset may be duplicated by repeating the script's random seed, command-line parameter \$1.

This particular variant starts with five rows of pegs. 1: | | | | | 2: | | | | 3: | | | 4: | | 5: | The number at the left identifies the row. The human player moves first, and alternates turns with the bot. A turn consists of removing at least one peg from a single row. It is permissable to remove ALL the pegs from a row. For example, in row 2, above, the player can remove 1, 2, 3, or 4 pegs. The player who removes the last peg loses. The strategy consists of trying to be the one who removes the next-to-last peg(s), leaving the loser with the final peg. To exit the game early, hit ENTER during your turn.

A Sed and Awk Micro-Primer This is a very brief introduction to the sed and awk text processing utilities. We will deal with only a few basic commands here, but that will suffice for understanding simple sed and awk constructs within shell scripts. sed: a non-interactive text file editor awk: a field-oriented pattern processing language with a C-style syntax For all their differences, the two utilities share a similar invocation syntax, use regular expressions , read input by default from stdin, and output to stdout. These are well-behaved UNIX tools, and they work together well. The output from one can be piped to the other, and their combined capabilities give shell scripts some of the power of Perl. Note One important difference between the utilities is that while shell scripts can easily pass arguments to sed, it is more cumbersome for awk (see Example 36-5 and Example 28-2). C.1. Sed Sed is a non-interactive [141] stream editor. It receives text input, whether from stdin or from a file, performs certain operations on specified lines of the input, one line at a time, then outputs the result to stdout or to a file. Within a shell script, sed is usually one of several tool components in a pipe. Sed determines which lines of its input that it will operate on from the address range passed to it. [142] Specify this address range either by line number or by a pattern to match. For example, 3d signals sed to delete line 3 of the input, and /Windows/d tells sed that you want every line of the input containing a match to &quot;Windows&quot; deleted. Of all the operations in the sed toolkit, we will focus primarily on the three most commonly used ones. These are printing (to stdout), deletion, and substitution. Table C-1. Basic sed operators Operator Name Effect [address-range]/p print Print [specified address range] [address-range]/d delete Delete [specified address range] s/pattern1/pattern2/ substitute Substitute pattern2 for first instance of pattern1 in a line [address-range]/s/pattern1/pattern2/ substitute Substitute pattern2 for first instance of pattern1 in a line, over address-range [address-range]/y/pattern1/pattern2/ transform replace any character in pattern1 with the corresponding character in pattern2, over address-range (equivalent of tr) [address] i pattern Filename insert Insert pattern at address indicated in file Filename. Usually used with -i in-place option. g global Operate on every pattern match within each matched line of input Note Unless the g (global) operator is appended to a substitute command, the substitution operates only on the first instance of a pattern match within each line. From the command-line and in a shell script, a sed operation may require quoting and certain options. sed -e '/^$/d' $filename # The -e option causes the next string to be interpreted as an editing instruction. # (If passing only a single instruction to sed, the &quot;-e&quot; is optional.) # The &quot;strong&quot; quotes ('') protect the RE characters in the instruction #+ from reinterpretation as special characters by the body of the script. # (This reserves RE expansion of the instruction for sed.) # # Operates on the text contained in file $filename. In certain cases, a sed editing command will not work with single quotes. filename=file1.txt pattern=BEGIN sed &quot;/^$pattern/d&quot; &quot;$filename&quot; # Works as specified. # sed '/^$pattern/d' &quot;$filename&quot; has unexpected results. # In this instance, with strong quoting (' ... '), #+ &quot;$pattern&quot; will not expand to &quot;BEGIN&quot;. Note Sed uses the -e option to specify that the following string is an instruction or set of instructions. If there is only a single instruction contained in the string, then this may be omitted. sed -n '/xzy/p' $filename # The -n option tells sed to print only those lines matching the pattern. # Otherwise all input lines would print. # The -e option not necessary here since there is only a single editing instruction. Table C-2. Examples of sed operators Notation Effect 8d Delete 8th line of input. /^$/d Delete all blank lines. 1,/^$/d Delete from beginning of input up to, and including first blank line. /Jones/p Print only lines containing &quot;Jones&quot; (with -n option). s/Windows/Linux/ Substitute &quot;Linux&quot; for first instance of &quot;Windows&quot; found in each input line. s/BSOD/stability/g Substitute &quot;stability&quot; for every instance of &quot;BSOD&quot; found in each input line. s/ *$// Delete all spaces at the end of every line. s/00*/0/g Compress all consecutive sequences of zeroes into a single zero. echo &quot;Working on it.&quot; | sed -e '1i How far are you along?' Prints &quot;How far are you along?&quot; as first line, &quot;Working on it&quot; as second. 5i 'Linux is great.' file.txt Inserts 'Linux is great.' at line 5 of the file file.txt. /GUI/d Delete all lines containing &quot;GUI&quot;. s/GUI//g Delete all instances of &quot;GUI&quot;, leaving the remainder of each line intact. Substituting a zero-length string for another is equivalent to deleting that string within a line of input. This leaves the remainder of the line intact. Applying s/GUI// to the line The most important parts of any application are its GUI and sound effects results in The most important parts of any application are its and sound effects A backslash forces the sed replacement command to continue on to the next line. This has the effect of using the newline at the end of the first line as the replacement string. s/^ */\ /g This substitution replaces line-beginning spaces with a newline. The net result is to replace paragraph indents with a blank line between paragraphs. An address range followed by one or more operations may require open and closed curly brackets, with appropriate newlines. /[0-9A-Za-z]/,/^$/{ /^$/d } This deletes only the first of each set of consecutive blank lines. That might be useful for single-spacing a text file, but retaining the blank line(s) between paragraphs. Note The usual delimiter that sed uses is /. However, sed allows other delimiters, such as %. This is useful when / is part of a replacement string, as in a file pathname. See Example 11-10 and Example 16-32. Tip A quick way to double-space a text file is sed G filename.

C.2. Awk Awk [143] is a full-featured text processing language with a syntax reminiscent of C. While it possesses an extensive set of operators and capabilities, we will cover only a few of these here - the ones most useful in shell scripts. Awk breaks each line of input passed to it into fields. By default, a field is a string of consecutive characters delimited by whitespace, though there are options for changing this. Awk parses and operates on each separate field. This makes it ideal for handling structured text files -- especially tables -- data organized into consistent chunks, such as rows and columns. Strong quoting and curly brackets enclose blocks of awk code within a shell script. # $1 is field #1, $2 is field #2, etc. echo one two | awk '{print $1}' # one echo one two | awk '{print $2}' # two # But what is field #0 ($0)? echo one two | awk '{print $0}' # one two # All the fields! awk '{print $3}' $filename # Prints field #3 of file $filename to stdout. awk '{print $1 $5 $6}' $filename # Prints fields #1, #5, and #6 of file $filename. awk '{print $0}' $filename # Prints the entire file! # Same effect as: cat $filename . . . or . . . sed '' $filename We have just seen the awk print command in action. The only other feature of awk we need to deal with here is variables. Awk handles variables similarly to shell scripts, though a bit more flexibly. { total += ${column_number} } This adds the value of column_number to the running total of total&gt;. Finally, to print &quot;total&quot;, there is an END command block, executed after the script has processed all its input. END { print total } Corresponding to the END, there is a BEGIN, for a code block to be performed before awk starts processing its input. The following example illustrates how awk can add text-parsing tools to a shell script. Example C-1. Counting Letter Occurrences #! /bin/sh # letter-count2.sh: Counting letter occurrences in a text file. # # Script by nyal [nyal@voila.fr]. # Used in ABS Guide with permission. # Recommented and reformatted by ABS Guide author. # Version 1.1: Modified to work with gawk 3.1.3. # (Will still work with earlier versions.)

Doing it correctly: A quick summary by David Wheeler http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/filenames-in-shell.html So, how can you process filenames correctly in shell? Here's a quick summary about how to do it correctly, for the impatient who &quot;just want the answer&quot;. In short: Double-quote to use &quot;$variable&quot; instead of $variable, set IFS to just newline and tab, prefix all globs/filenames so they cannot begin with &quot;-&quot; when expanded, and use one of a few templates that work correctly. Here are some of those templates that work correctly: IFS=&quot;$(printf '\n\t')&quot; # Remove SPACE, so filenames with spaces work well. # Correct glob use: #+ always use &quot;for&quot; loop, prefix glob, check for existence: for file in ./* ; do # Use &quot;./*&quot; ... NEVER bare &quot;*&quot; ... if [ -e &quot;$file&quot; ] ; then # Make sure it isn't an empty match. COMMAND ... &quot;$file&quot; ... fi done # Correct glob use, but requires nonstandard bash extension. shopt -s nullglob # Bash extension, #+ so that empty glob matches will work. for file in ./* ; do # Use &quot;./*&quot;, NEVER bare &quot;*&quot; COMMAND ... &quot;$file&quot; ... done # These handle all filenames correctly; #+ can be unwieldy if COMMAND is large: find ... -exec COMMAND... {} \; find ... -exec COMMAND... {} \+ # If multiple files are okay for COMMAND. # This skips filenames with control characters #+ (including tab and newline). IFS=&quot;$(printf '\n\t')&quot; controlchars=&quot;$(printf '*[\001-\037\177]*')&quot; for file in $(find . ! -name &quot;$controlchars&quot;') ; do COMMAND &quot;$file&quot; ... done # Okay if filenames can't contain tabs or newlines -- #+ beware the assumption. IFS=&quot;$(printf '\n\t')&quot; for file in $(find .) ; do COMMAND &quot;$file&quot; ... done # Requires nonstandard but common extensions in find and xargs: find . -print0 | xargs -0 COMMAND # Requires nonstandard extensions to find and to shell (bash works). # variables might not stay set once the loop ends: find . -print0 | while IFS=&quot;&quot; read -r -d &quot;&quot; file ; do ... COMMAND &quot;$file&quot; # Use quoted &quot;$file&quot;, not $file, everywhere. done # Requires nonstandard extensions to find and to shell (bash works). # Underlying system must include named pipes (FIFOs) #+ or the /dev/fd mechanism. # In this version, variables *do* stay set after the loop ends, # and you can read from stdin. #+ (Change the 4 to another number if fd 4 is needed.) while IFS=&quot;&quot; read -r -d &quot;&quot; file &lt;&amp;4 ; do COMMAND &quot;$file&quot; # Use quoted &quot;$file&quot; -- not $file, everywhere. done 4&lt; &lt;(find . -print0) # Named pipe version. # Requires nonstandard extensions to find and to shell's read (bash ok). # Underlying system must include named pipes (FIFOs). # Again, in this version, variables *do* stay set after the loop ends, # and you can read from stdin. # (Change the 4 to something else if fd 4 needed). mkfifo mypipe find . -print0 &gt; mypipe &amp; while IFS=&quot;&quot; read -r -d &quot;&quot; file &lt;&amp;4 ; do COMMAND &quot;$file&quot; # Use quoted &quot;$file&quot;, not $file, everywhere. done 4&lt; mypipe Appendix E. Exit Codes With Special Meanings Table E-1. Reserved Exit Codes Exit Code Number Meaning Example Comments 1 Catchall for general errors let &quot;var1 = 1/0&quot; Miscellaneous errors, such as &quot;divide by zero&quot; and other impermissible operations 2 Misuse of shell builtins (according to Bash documentation) empty_function() {} Missing keyword or command, or permission problem (and diff return code on a failed binary file comparison). 126 Command invoked cannot execute /dev/null Permission problem or command is not an executable 127 &quot;command not found&quot; illegal_command Possible problem with $PATH or a typo 128 Invalid argument to exit exit 3.14159 exit takes only integer args in the range 0 - 255 (see first footnote) 128+n Fatal error signal &quot;n&quot; kill -9 $PPID of script $? returns 137 (128 + 9) 130 Script terminated by Control-C Ctl-C Control-C is fatal error signal 2, (130 = 128 + 2, see above) 255* Exit status out of range exit -1 exit takes only integer args in the range 0 - 255 According to the above table, exit codes 1 - 2, 126 - 165, and 255 [144] have special meanings, and should therefore be avoided for user-specified exit parameters. Ending a script with exit 127 would certainly cause confusion when troubleshooting (is the error code a &quot;command not found&quot; or a user-defined one?). However, many scripts use an exit 1 as a general bailout-upon-error. Since exit code 1 signifies so many possible errors, it is not particularly useful in debugging. There has been an attempt to systematize exit status numbers (see /usr/include/sysexits.h), but this is intended for C and C++ programmers. A similar standard for scripting might be appropriate. The author of this document proposes restricting user-defined exit codes to the range 64 - 113 (in addition to 0, for success), to conform with the C/C++ standard. This would allot 50 valid codes, and make troubleshooting scripts more straightforward. [145] All user-defined exit codes in the accompanying examples to this document conform to this standard, except where overriding circumstances exist, as in Example 9-2. Note Issuing a $? from the command-line after a shell script exits gives results consistent with the table above only from the Bash or sh prompt. Running the C-shell or tcsh may give different values in some cases. Appendix F. A Detailed Introduction to I/O and I/O Redirection written by Stéphane Chazelas, and revised by the document author A command expects the first three file descriptors to be available. The first, fd 0 (standard input, stdin), is for reading. The other two (fd 1, stdout and fd 2, stderr) are for writing. There is a stdin, stdout, and a stderr associated with each command. ls 2&gt;&amp;1 means temporarily connecting the stderr of the ls command to the same &quot;resource&quot; as the shell's stdout. By convention, a command reads its input from fd 0 (stdin), prints normal output to fd 1 (stdout), and error ouput to fd 2 (stderr). If one of those three fd's is not open, you may encounter problems: bash$ cat /etc/passwd &gt;&amp;- cat: standard output: Bad file descriptor For example, when xterm runs, it first initializes itself. Before running the user's shell, xterm opens the terminal device (/dev/pts/&lt;n&gt; or something similar) three times. At this point, Bash inherits these three file descriptors, and each command (child process) run by Bash inherits them in turn, except when you redirect the command. Redirection means reassigning one of the file descriptors to another file (or a pipe, or anything permissible). File descriptors may be reassigned locally (for a command, a command group, a subshell, a while or if or case or for loop...), or globally, for the remainder of the shell (using exec). ls &gt; /dev/null means running ls with its fd 1 connected to /dev/null. bash$ lsof -a -p $$ -d0,1,2 COMMAND PID USER FD TYPE DEVICE SIZE NODE NAME bash 363 bozo 0u CHR 136,1 3 /dev/pts/1 bash 363 bozo 1u CHR 136,1 3 /dev/pts/1 bash 363 bozo 2u CHR 136,1 3 /dev/pts/1 bash$ exec 2&gt; /dev/null bash$ lsof -a -p $$ -d0,1,2 COMMAND PID USER FD TYPE DEVICE SIZE NODE NAME bash 371 bozo 0u CHR 136,1 3 /dev/pts/1 bash 371 bozo 1u CHR 136,1 3 /dev/pts/1 bash 371 bozo 2w CHR 1,3 120 /dev/null bash$ bash -c 'lsof -a -p $$ -d0,1,2' | cat COMMAND PID USER FD TYPE DEVICE SIZE NODE NAME lsof 379 root 0u CHR 136,1 3 /dev/pts/1 lsof 379 root 1w FIFO 0,0 7118 pipe lsof 379 root 2u CHR 136,1 3 /dev/pts/1 bash$ echo &quot;$(bash -c 'lsof -a -p $$ -d0,1,2' 2&gt;&amp;1)&quot; COMMAND PID USER FD TYPE DEVICE SIZE NODE NAME lsof 426 root 0u CHR 136,1 3 /dev/pts/1 lsof 426 root 1w FIFO 0,0 7520 pipe lsof 426 root 2w FIFO 0,0 7520 pipe This works for different types of redirection. Exercise: Analyze the following script. #! /usr/bin/env bash mkfifo /tmp/fifo1 /tmp/fifo2 while read a; do echo &quot;FIFO1: $a&quot;; done &lt; /tmp/fifo1 &amp; exec 7&gt; /tmp/fifo1 exec 8&gt; &gt;(while read a; do echo &quot;FD8: $a, to fd7&quot;; done &gt;&amp;7) exec 3&gt;&amp;1 ( ( ( while read a; do echo &quot;FIFO2: $a&quot;; done &lt; /tmp/fifo2 | tee /dev/stderr \ | tee /dev/fd/4 | tee /dev/fd/5 | tee /dev/fd/6 &gt;&amp;7 &amp; exec 3&gt; /tmp/fifo2 echo 1st, to stdout sleep 1 echo 2nd, to stderr &gt;&amp;2 sleep 1 echo 3rd, to fd 3 &gt;&amp;3 sleep 1 echo 4th, to fd 4 &gt;&amp;4 sleep 1 echo 5th, to fd 5 &gt;&amp;5 sleep 1 echo 6th, through a pipe | sed 's/.*/PIPE: &amp;, to fd 5/' &gt;&amp;5 sleep 1 echo 7th, to fd 6 &gt;&amp;6 sleep 1 echo 8th, to fd 7 &gt;&amp;7 sleep 1 echo 9th, to fd 8 &gt;&amp;8 ) 4&gt;&amp;1 &gt;&amp;3 3&gt;&amp;- | while read a; do echo &quot;FD4: $a&quot;; done 1&gt;&amp;3 5&gt;&amp;- 6&gt;&amp;- ) 5&gt;&amp;1 &gt;&amp;3 | while read a; do echo &quot;FD5: $a&quot;; done 1&gt;&amp;3 6&gt;&amp;- ) 6&gt;&amp;1 &gt;&amp;3 | while read a; do echo &quot;FD6: $a&quot;; done 3&gt;&amp;- rm -f /tmp/fifo1 /tmp/fifo2 # For each command and subshell, figure out which fd points to what. # Good luck! exit 0 Appendix G. Command-Line Options Many executables, whether binaries or script files, accept options to modify their run-time behavior. For example: from the command-line, typing command -o would invoke command, with option o. G.1. Standard Command-Line Options Over time, there has evolved a loose standard for the meanings of command-line option flags. The GNU utilities conform more closely to this &quot;standard&quot; than older UNIX utilities. Traditionally, UNIX command-line options consist of a dash, followed by one or more lowercase letters. The GNU utilities added a double-dash, followed by a complete word or compound word. The two most widely-accepted options are: -h --help Help: Give usage message and exit. -v --version Version: Show program version and exit. Other common options are: -a --all All: show all information or operate on all arguments. -l --list List: list files or arguments without taking other action. -o Output filename -q --quiet Quiet: suppress stdout. -r -R --recursive Recursive: Operate recursively (down directory tree). -v --verbose Verbose: output additional information to stdout or stderr. -z --compress Compress: apply compression (usually gzip). However: In tar and gawk: -f --file File: filename follows. In cp, mv, rm: -f --force Force: force overwrite of target file(s). Caution Many UNIX and Linux utilities deviate from this &quot;standard,&quot; so it is dangerous to assume that a given option will behave in a standard way. Always check the man page for the command in question when in doubt. A complete table of recommended options for the GNU utilities is available at the GNU standards page. G.2. Bash Command-Line Options Bash itself has a number of command-line options. Here are some of the more useful ones. -c Read commands from the following string and assign any arguments to the positional parameters. bash$ bash -c 'set a b c d; IFS=&quot;+-;&quot;; echo &quot;$*&quot;' a+b+c+d -r --restricted Runs the shell, or a script, in restricted mode. --posix Forces Bash to conform to POSIX mode. --version Display Bash version information and exit. -- End of options. Anything further on the command line is an argument, not an option. Appendix H. Important Files startup files These files contain the aliases and environmental variables made available to Bash running as a user shell and to all Bash scripts invoked after system initialization. /etc/profile Systemwide defaults, mostly setting the environment (all Bourne-type shells, not just Bash [146]) /etc/bashrc systemwide functions and aliases for Bash $HOME/.bash_profile user-specific Bash environmental default settings, found in each user's home directory (the local counterpart to /etc/profile) $HOME/.bashrc user-specific Bash init file, found in each user's home directory (the local counterpart to /etc/bashrc). Only interactive shells and user scripts read this file. See Appendix M for a sample .bashrc file. logout file $HOME/.bash_logout user-specific instruction file, found in each user's home directory. Upon exit from a login (Bash) shell, the commands in this file execute. data files /etc/passwd A listing of all the user accounts on the system, their identities, their home directories, the groups they belong to, and their default shell. Note that the user passwords are not stored in this file, [147] but in /etc/shadow in encrypted form. system configuration files /etc/sysconfig/hwconf Listing and description of attached hardware devices. This information is in text form and can be extracted and parsed. bash$ grep -A 5 AUDIO /etc/sysconfig/hwconf class: AUDIO bus: PCI detached: 0 driver: snd-intel8x0 desc: &quot;Intel Corporation 82801CA/CAM AC'97 Audio Controller&quot; vendorId: 8086 Note This file is present on Red Hat and Fedora Core installations, but may be missing from other distros. Appendix I. Important System Directories Sysadmins and anyone else writing administrative scripts should be intimately familiar with the following system directories. /bin Binaries (executables). Basic system programs and utilities (such as bash). /usr/bin [148] More system binaries. /usr/local/bin Miscellaneous binaries local to the particular machine. /sbin System binaries. Basic system administrative programs and utilities (such as fsck). /usr/sbin More system administrative programs and utilities. /etc Et cetera. Systemwide configuration scripts. Of particular interest are the /etc/fstab (filesystem table), /etc/mtab (mounted filesystem table), and the /etc/inittab files. /etc/rc.d Boot scripts, on Red Hat and derivative distributions of Linux. /usr/share/doc Documentation for installed packages. /usr/man The systemwide manpages. /dev Device directory. Entries (but not mount points) for physical and virtual devices. See Chapter 29. /proc Process directory. Contains information and statistics about running processes and kernel parameters. See Chapter 29. /sys Systemwide device directory. Contains information and statistics about device and device names. This is newly added to Linux with the 2.6.X kernels. /mnt Mount. Directory for mounting hard drive partitions, such as /mnt/dos, and physical devices. In newer Linux distros, the /media directory has taken over as the preferred mount point for I/O devices. /media In newer Linux distros, the preferred mount point for I/O devices, such as CD/DVD drives or USB flash drives. /var Variable (changeable) system files. This is a catchall &quot;scratchpad&quot; directory for data generated while a Linux/UNIX machine is running. /var/log Systemwide log files. /var/spool/mail User mail spool. /lib Systemwide library files. /usr/lib More systemwide library files. /tmp System temporary files. /boot System boot directory. The kernel, module links, system map, and boot manager reside here. Warning Altering files in this directory may result in an unbootable system. Appendix J. An Introduction to Programmable Completion The programmable completion feature in Bash permits typing a partial command, then pressing the [Tab] key to auto-complete the command sequence. [149] If multiple completions are possible, then [Tab] lists them all. Let's see how it works. bash$ xtra[Tab] xtraceroute xtrapin xtrapproto xtraceroute.real xtrapinfo xtrapreset xtrapchar xtrapout xtrapstats bash$ xtrac[Tab] xtraceroute xtraceroute.real bash$ xtraceroute.r[Tab] xtraceroute.real Tab completion also works for variables and path names. bash$ echo $BASH[Tab] $BASH $BASH_COMPLETION $BASH_SUBSHELL $BASH_ARGC $BASH_COMPLETION_DIR $BASH_VERSINFO $BASH_ARGV $BASH_LINENO $BASH_VERSION $BASH_COMMAND $BASH_SOURCE bash$ echo /usr/local/[Tab] bin/ etc/ include/ libexec/ sbin/ src/ doc/ games/ lib/ man/ share/ The Bash complete and compgen builtins make it possible for tab completion to recognize partial parameters and options to commands. In a very simple case, we can use complete from the command-line to specify a short list of acceptable parameters. bash$ touch sample_command bash$ touch file1.txt file2.txt file2.doc file30.txt file4.zzz bash$ chmod +x sample_command bash$ complete -f -X '!*.txt' sample_command bash$ ./sample[Tab][Tab] sample_command file1.txt file2.txt file30.txt The -f option to complete specifies filenames, and -X the filter pattern. For anything more complex, we could write a script that specifies a list of acceptable command-line parameters. The compgen builtin expands a list of arguments to generate completion matches. Let us take a modified version of the UseGetOpt.sh script as an example command. This script accepts a number of command-line parameters, preceded by either a single or double dash. And here is the corresponding completion script, by convention given a filename corresponding to its associated command. Example J-1. Completion script for UseGetOpt.sh # file: UseGetOpt-2 # UseGetOpt-2.sh parameter-completion _UseGetOpt-2 () # By convention, the function name { #+ starts with an underscore. local cur # Pointer to current completion word. # By convention, it's named &quot;cur&quot; but this isn't strictly necessary. COMPREPLY=() # Array variable storing the possible completions. cur=${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]} case &quot;$cur&quot; in -*) COMPREPLY=( $( compgen -W '-a -d -f -l -t -h --aoption --debug \ --file --log --test --help --' -- $cur ) );; # Generate the completion matches and load them into $COMPREPLY array. # xx) May add more cases here. # yy) # zz) esac return 0 } complete -F _UseGetOpt-2 -o filenames ./UseGetOpt-2.sh # ^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^ Invokes the function _UseGetOpt-2. Now, let's try it. bash$ source UseGetOpt-2 bash$ ./UseGetOpt-2.sh -[Tab] -- --aoption --debug --file --help --log --test -a -d -f -h -l -t bash$ ./UseGetOpt-2.sh --[Tab] -- --aoption --debug --file --help --log --test We begin by sourcing the &quot;completion script.&quot; This sets the command-line parameters. [150] In the first instance, hitting [Tab] after a single dash, the output is all the possible parameters preceded by one or more dashes. Hitting [Tab] after two dashes gives the possible parameters preceded by two or more dashes. Now, just what is the point of having to jump through flaming hoops to enable command-line tab completion? It saves keystrokes.

Localization Localization is an undocumented Bash feature. A localized shell script echoes its text output in the language defined as the system's locale. A Linux user in Berlin, Germany, would get script output in German, whereas his cousin in Berlin, Maryland, would get output from the same script in English. To create a localized script, use the following template to write all messages to the user (error messages, prompts, etc.). #!/bin/bash # localized.sh # Script by Stéphane Chazelas, #+ modified by Bruno Haible, bugfixed by Alfredo Pironti. . gettext.sh E_CDERROR=65 error() { printf &quot;$@&quot; &gt;&amp;2 exit $E_CDERROR } cd $var || error &quot;`eval_gettext \&quot;Can\'t cd to \\\$var.\&quot;`&quot; # The triple backslashes (escapes) in front of $var needed #+ &quot;because eval_gettext expects a string #+ where the variable values have not yet been substituted.&quot; # -- per Bruno Haible read -p &quot;`gettext \&quot;Enter the value: \&quot;`&quot; var # ... # ------------------------------------------------------------------ # Alfredo Pironti comments: # This script has been modified to not use the $&quot;...&quot; syntax in #+ favor of the &quot;`gettext \&quot;...\&quot;`&quot; syntax. # This is ok, but with the new localized.sh program, the commands #+ &quot;bash -D filename&quot; and &quot;bash --dump-po-string filename&quot; #+ will produce no output #+ (because those command are only searching for the $&quot;...&quot; strings)! # The ONLY way to extract strings from the new file is to use the # 'xgettext' program. However, the xgettext program is buggy. # Note that 'xgettext' has another bug. # # The shell fragment: # gettext -s &quot;I like Bash&quot; # will be correctly extracted, but . . . # xgettext -s &quot;I like Bash&quot; # . . . fails! # 'xgettext' will extract &quot;-s&quot; because #+ the command only extracts the #+ very first argument after the 'gettext' word. # Escape characters: # # To localize a sentence like # echo -e &quot;Hello\tworld!&quot; #+ you must use # echo -e &quot;`gettext \&quot;Hello\\tworld\&quot;`&quot; # The &quot;double escape character&quot; before the `t' is needed because #+ 'gettext' will search for a string like: 'Hello\tworld' # This is because gettext will read one literal `\') #+ and will output a string like &quot;Bonjour\tmonde&quot;, #+ so the 'echo' command will display the message correctly. # # You may not use # echo &quot;`gettext -e \&quot;Hello\tworld\&quot;`&quot; #+ due to the xgettext bug explained above. # Let's localize the following shell fragment: # echo &quot;-h display help and exit&quot; # # First, one could do this: # echo &quot;`gettext \&quot;-h display help and exit\&quot;`&quot; # This way 'xgettext' will work ok, #+ but the 'gettext' program will read &quot;-h&quot; as an option! # # One solution could be # echo &quot;`gettext -- \&quot;-h display help and exit\&quot;`&quot; # This way 'gettext' will work, #+ but 'xgettext' will extract &quot;--&quot;, as referred to above. # # The workaround you may use to get this string localized is # echo -e &quot;`gettext \&quot;\\0-h display help and exit\&quot;`&quot; # We have added a \0 (NULL) at the beginning of the sentence. # This way 'gettext' works correctly, as does 'xgettext.' # Moreover, the NULL character won't change the behavior #+ of the 'echo' command. # ------------------------------------------------------------------ bash$ bash -D localized.sh &quot;Can't cd to %s.&quot; &quot;Enter the value: &quot; This lists all the localized text. (The -D option lists double-quoted strings prefixed by a $, without executing the script.) bash$ bash --dump-po-strings localized.sh #: a:6 msgid &quot;Can't cd to %s.&quot; msgstr &quot;&quot; #: a:7 msgid &quot;Enter the value: &quot; msgstr &quot;&quot; The --dump-po-strings option to Bash resembles the -D option, but uses gettext &quot;po&quot; format. Note Bruno Haible points out: Starting with gettext-0.12.2, xgettext -o - localized.sh is recommended instead of bash --dump-po-strings localized.sh, because xgettext . . . 1. understands the gettext and eval_gettext commands (whereas bash --dump-po-strings understands only its deprecated $&quot;...&quot; syntax) 2. can extract comments placed by the programmer, intended to be read by the translator. This shell code is then not specific to Bash any more; it works the same way with Bash 1.x and other /bin/sh implementations. Now, build a language.po file for each language that the script will be translated into, specifying the msgstr. Alfredo Pironti gives the following example: fr.po: #: a:6 msgid &quot;Can't cd to $var.&quot; msgstr &quot;Impossible de se positionner dans le repertoire $var.&quot; #: a:7 msgid &quot;Enter the value: &quot; msgstr &quot;Entrez la valeur : &quot; # The string are dumped with the variable names, not with the %s syntax, #+ similar to C programs. #+ This is a very cool feature if the programmer uses #+ variable names that make sense! Then, run msgfmt. msgfmt -o localized.sh.mo fr.po Place the resulting localized.sh.mo file in the /usr/local/share/locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES directory, and at the beginning of the script, insert the lines: TEXTDOMAINDIR=/usr/local/share/locale TEXTDOMAIN=localized.sh If a user on a French system runs the script, she will get French messages. Note With older versions of Bash or other shells, localization requires gettext, using the -s option. In this case, the script becomes: #!/bin/bash # localized.sh E_CDERROR=65 error() { local format=$1 shift printf &quot;$(gettext -s &quot;$format&quot;)&quot; &quot;$@&quot; &gt;&amp;2 exit $E_CDERROR } cd $var || error &quot;Can't cd to %s.&quot; &quot;$var&quot; read -p &quot;$(gettext -s &quot;Enter the value: &quot;)&quot; var # ... The TEXTDOMAIN and TEXTDOMAINDIR variables need to be set and exported to the environment. This should be done within the script itself. --- This appendix written by Stéphane Chazelas, with modifications suggested by Alfredo Pironti, and by Bruno Haible, maintainer of GNU gettext.

Internal variables associated with Bash history commands: $HISTCMD $HISTCONTROL $HISTIGNORE $HISTFILE $HISTFILESIZE $HISTSIZE $HISTTIMEFORMAT (Bash, ver. 3.0 or later) !! !$ !# !N !-N !STRING !?STRING? ^STRING^string^ Unfortunately, the Bash history tools find no use in scripting. #!/bin/bash # history.sh # A (vain) attempt to use the 'history' command in a script. history # No output. var=$(history); echo &quot;$var&quot; # $var is empty. # History commands are, by default, disabled within a script. # However, as dhw points out, #+ set -o history #+ enables the history mechanism. set -o history var=$(history); echo &quot;$var&quot; # 1 var=$(history) bash$ ./history.sh (no output) The Advancing in the Bash Shell site gives a good introduction to the use of history commands in Bash. Appendix M. Sample .bashrc and .bash_profile Files The ~/.bashrc file determines the behavior of interactive shells. A good look at this file can lead to a better understanding of Bash. Emmanuel Rouat contributed the following very elaborate .bashrc file, written for a Linux system. He welcomes reader feedback on it. Study the file carefully, and feel free to reuse code snippets and functions from it in your own .bashrc file or even in your scripts. Example M-1. Sample .bashrc file # =============================================================== # # # PERSONAL $HOME/.bashrc FILE for bash-3.0 (or later) # By Emmanuel Rouat [no-email] # # Last modified: Tue Nov 20 22:04:47 CET 2012 # This file is normally read by interactive shells only. #+ Here is the place to define your aliases, functions and #+ other interactive features like your prompt. # # The majority of the code here assumes you are on a GNU #+ system (most likely a Linux box) and is often based on code #+ found on Usenet or Internet. # # See for instance: # http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/index.html # http://www.caliban.org/bash # http://www.shelldorado.com/scripts/categories.html # http://www.dotfiles.org # # The choice of colors was done for a shell with a dark background #+ (white on black), and this is usually also suited for pure text-mode #+ consoles (no X server available). If you use a white background, #+ you'll have to do some other choices for readability. # # This bashrc file is a bit overcrowded. # Remember, it is just just an example. # Tailor it to your needs. # # =============================================================== # # --&gt;

Appendix N. Converting DOS Batch Files to Shell Scripts Quite a number of programmers learned scripting on a PC running DOS. Even the crippled DOS batch file language allowed writing some fairly powerful scripts and applications, though they often required extensive kludges and workarounds. Occasionally, the need still arises to convert an old DOS batch file to a UNIX shell script. This is generally not difficult, as DOS batch file operators are only a limited subset of the equivalent shell scripting ones. Table N-1. Batch file keywords / variables / operators, and their shell equivalents Batch File Operator Shell Script Equivalent Meaning % $ command-line parameter prefix / - command option flag \ / directory path separator == = (equal-to) string comparison test !==! != (not equal-to) string comparison test | | pipe @ set +v do not echo current command * * filename &quot;wild card&quot; &gt; &gt; file redirection (overwrite) &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; file redirection (append) &lt; &lt; redirect stdin %VAR% $VAR environmental variable REM # comment NOT ! negate following test NUL /dev/null &quot;black hole&quot; for burying command output ECHO echo echo (many more option in Bash) ECHO. echo echo blank line ECHO OFF set +v do not echo command(s) following FOR %%VAR IN (LIST) DO for var in [list]; do &quot;for&quot; loop :LABEL none (unnecessary) label GOTO none (use a function) jump to another location in the script PAUSE sleep pause or wait an interval CHOICE case or select menu choice IF if if-test IF EXIST FILENAME if [ -e filename ] test if file exists IF !%N==! if [ -z &quot;$N&quot; ] if replaceable parameter &quot;N&quot; not present CALL source or .

These must be translated into their UNIX equivalents in order to convert a batch file into a shell script. Table N-2.

Many DOS batch files rely on auxiliary utilities, such as ask.com, a crippled counterpart to read. DOS supports only a very limited and incompatible subset of filename wild-card expansion, recognizing just the * and ? characters. Converting a DOS batch file into a shell script is generally straightforward, and the result ofttimes reads better than the original. Example N-1. VIEWDATA.BAT: DOS Batch File REM VIEWDATA REM INSPIRED BY AN EXAMPLE IN &quot;DOS POWERTOOLS&quot; REM BY PAUL SOMERSON @ECHO OFF IF !%1==! GOTO VIEWDATA REM IF NO COMMAND-LINE ARG... FIND &quot;%1&quot; C:\BOZO\BOOKLIST.TXT GOTO EXIT0 REM PRINT LINE WITH STRING MATCH, THEN EXIT. :VIEWDATA TYPE C:\BOZO\BOOKLIST.TXT | MORE REM SHOW ENTIRE FILE, 1 PAGE AT A TIME. :EXIT0 The script conversion is somewhat of an improvement. [152] Example N-2. viewdata.sh: Shell Script Conversion of VIEWDATA.BAT #!/bin/bash # viewdata.sh # Conversion of VIEWDATA.BAT to shell script. DATAFILE=/home/bozo/datafiles/book-collection.data ARGNO=1 # @ECHO OFF Command unnecessary here. if [ $# -lt &quot;$ARGNO&quot; ] # IF !%1==! GOTO VIEWDATA then less $DATAFILE # TYPE C:\MYDIR\BOOKLIST.TXT | MORE else grep &quot;$1&quot; $DATAFILE # FIND &quot;%1&quot; C:\MYDIR\BOOKLIST.TXT fi exit 0 # :EXIT0 # GOTOs, labels, smoke-and-mirrors, and flimflam unnecessary. # The converted script is short, sweet, and clean, #+ which is more than can be said for the original. Ted Davis' Shell Scripts on the PC site had a set of comprehensive tutorials on the old-fashioned art of batch file programming. Unfortunately the page has vanished without a trace. Appendix O. Exercises The exercises that follow test and extend your knowledge of scripting. Think of them as a challenge, as an entertaining way to take you further along the stony path toward UNIX wizardry. On a dingy side street in a run-down section of Hoboken, New Jersey, there sits a nondescript squat two-story brick building with an inscription incised on a marble plate in its wall: Bash Scripting Hall of Fame. Inside, among various dusty uninteresting exhibits is a corroding, cobweb-festooned brass plaque inscribed with a short, very short list of those few persons who have successfully mastered the material in the Advanced Bash Scripting Guide, as evidenced by their performance on the following Exercise sections. (Alas, the author of the ABS Guide is not represented among the exhibits. This is possibly due to malicious rumors about lack of credentials and deficient scripting skills.) O.1. Analyzing Scripts Examine the following script. Run it, then explain what it does. Annotate the script and rewrite it in a more compact and elegant manner. #!/bin/bash MAX=10000 for((nr=1; nr&lt;$MAX; nr++)) do let &quot;t1 = nr % 5&quot; if [ &quot;$t1&quot; -ne 3 ] then continue fi let &quot;t2 = nr % 7&quot; if [ &quot;$t2&quot; -ne 4 ] then continue fi let &quot;t3 = nr % 9&quot; if [ &quot;$t3&quot; -ne 5 ] then continue fi break # What happens when you comment out this line? Why? done echo &quot;Number = $nr&quot; exit 0 --- Explain what the following script does. It is really just a parameterized command-line pipe. #!/bin/bash DIRNAME=/usr/bin FILETYPE=&quot;shell script&quot; LOGFILE=logfile file &quot;$DIRNAME&quot;/* | fgrep &quot;$FILETYPE&quot; | tee $LOGFILE | wc -l exit 0 --- Examine and explain the following script. For hints, you might refer to the listings for find and stat. #!/bin/bash # Author: Nathan Coulter # This code is released to the public domain. # The author gave permission to use this code snippet in the ABS Guide. find -maxdepth 1 -type f -printf '%f\000' | { while read -d $'\000'; do mv &quot;$REPLY&quot; &quot;$(date -d &quot;$(stat -c '%y' &quot;$REPLY&quot;) &quot; '+%Y%m%d%H%M%S' )-$REPLY&quot; done } # Warning: Test-drive this script in a &quot;scratch&quot; directory. # It will somehow affect all the files there. --- A reader sent in the following code snippet. while read LINE do echo $LINE done &lt; `tail -f /var/log/messages` He wished to write a script tracking changes to the system log file, /var/log/messages. Unfortunately, the above code block hangs and does nothing useful. Why? Fix this so it does work. (Hint: rather than redirecting the stdin of the loop, try a pipe.) --- Analyze the following &quot;one-liner&quot; (here split into two lines for clarity) contributed by Rory Winston: export SUM=0; for f in $(find src -name &quot;*.java&quot;); do export SUM=$(($SUM + $(wc -l $f | awk '{ print $1 }'))); done; echo $SUM Hint: First, break the script up into bite-sized sections. Then, carefully examine its use of double-parentheses arithmetic, the export command, the find command, the wc command, and awk. --- Analyze Example A-10, and reorganize it in a simplified and more logical style. See how many of the variables can be eliminated, and try to optimize the script to speed up its execution time. Alter the script so that it accepts any ordinary ASCII text file as input for its initial &quot;generation&quot;. The script will read the first $ROW*$COL characters, and set the occurrences of vowels as &quot;living&quot; cells. Hint: be sure to translate the spaces in the input file to underscore characters. O.2. Writing Scripts Write a script to carry out each of the following tasks. EASY Self-reproducing Script Write a script that backs itself up, that is, copies itself to a file named backup.sh. Hint: Use the cat command and the appropriate positional parameter. Home Directory Listing Perform a recursive directory listing on the user's home directory and save the information to a file. Compress the file, have the script prompt the user to insert a USB flash drive, then press ENTER. Finally, save the file to the flash drive after making certain the flash drive has properly mounted by parsing the output of df. Note that the flash drive must be unmounted before it is removed. Converting for loops to while and until loops Convert the for loops in Example 11-1 to while loops. Hint: store the data in an array and step through the array elements. Having already done the &quot;heavy lifting,&quot; now convert the loops in the example to until loops. Changing the line spacing of a text file Write a script that reads each line of a target file, then writes the line back to stdout, but with an extra blank line following. This has the effect of double-spacing the file. Include all necessary code to check whether the script gets the necessary command-line argument (a filename), and whether the specified file exists. When the script runs correctly, modify it to triple-space the target file. Finally, write a script to remove all blank lines from the target file, single-spacing it. Backwards Listing Write a script that echoes itself to stdout, but backwards. Automatically Decompressing Files Given a list of filenames as input, this script queries each target file (parsing the output of the file command) for the type of compression used on it. Then the script automatically invokes the appropriate decompression command (gunzip, bunzip2, unzip, uncompress, or whatever). If a target file is not compressed, the script emits a warning message, but takes no other action on that particular file. Unique System ID Generate a &quot;unique&quot; 6-digit hexadecimal identifier for your computer. Do not use the flawed hostid command. Hint: md5sum /etc/passwd, then select the first 6 digits of output. Backup Archive as a &quot;tarball&quot; (*.tar.gz file) all the files in your home directory tree (/home/your-name) that have been modified in the last 24 hours. Hint: use find. Optional: you may use this as the basis of a backup script. Checking whether a process is still running Given a process ID (PID) as an argument, this script will check, at user-specified intervals, whether the given process is still running. You may use the ps and sleep commands. Primes Print (to stdout) all prime numbers between 60000 and 63000. The output should be nicely formatted in columns (hint: use printf). Lottery Numbers One type of lottery involves picking five different numbers, in the range of 1 - 50. Write a script that generates five pseudorandom numbers in this range, with no duplicates. The script will give the option of echoing the numbers to stdout or saving them to a file, along with the date and time the particular number set was generated. (If your script consistently generates winning lottery numbers, then you can retire on the proceeds and leave shell scripting to those of us who have to work for a living.) INTERMEDIATE Integer or String Write a script function that determines if an argument passed to it is an integer or a string. The function will return TRUE (0) if passed an integer, and FALSE (1) if passed a string. Hint: What does the following expression return when $1 is not an integer? expr $1 + 0 ASCII to Integer The atoi function in C converts a string character to an integer. Write a shell script function that performs the same operation. Likewise, write a shell script function that does the inverse, mirroring the C itoa function which converts an integer into an ASCII character. Managing Disk Space List, one at a time, all files larger than 100K in the /home/username directory tree. Give the user the option to delete or compress the file, then proceed to show the next one. Write to a logfile the names of all deleted files and the deletion times. Banner Simulate the functionality of the deprecated banner command in a script. Removing Inactive Accounts Inactive accounts on a network server waste disk space and may become a security risk. Write an administrative script (to be invoked by root or the cron daemon) that checks for and deletes user accounts that have not been accessed within the last 90 days. Enforcing Disk Quotas Write a script for a multi-user system that checks users' disk usage. If a user surpasses a preset limit (500 MB, for example) in her /home/username directory, then the script automatically sends her a &quot;pigout&quot; warning e-mail. The script will use the du and mail commands. As an option, it will allow setting and enforcing quotas using the quota and setquota commands. Logged in User Information For all logged in users, show their real names and the time and date of their last login. Hint: use who, lastlog, and parse /etc/passwd. Safe Delete Implement, as a script, a &quot;safe&quot; delete command, sdel.sh. Filenames passed as command-line arguments to this script are not deleted, but instead gzipped if not already compressed (use file to check), then moved to a ~/TRASH directory. Upon invocation, the script checks the ~/TRASH directory for files older than 48 hours and permanently deletes them. (An better alternative might be to have a second script handle this, periodically invoked by the cron daemon.) Extra credit: Write the script so it can handle files and directories recursively. This would give it the capability of &quot;safely deleting&quot; entire directory structures. Making Change What is the most efficient way to make change for $1.68, using only coins in common circulations (up to 25c)? It's 6 quarters, 1 dime, a nickel, and three cents. Given any arbitrary command-line input in dollars and cents ($*.??), calculate the change, using the minimum number of coins. If your home country is not the United States, you may use your local currency units instead. The script will need to parse the command-line input, then change it to multiples of the smallest monetary unit (cents or whatever). Hint: look at Example 24-8. Quadratic Equations Solve a quadratic equation of the form Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0. Have a script take as arguments the coefficients, A, B, and C, and return the solutions to five decimal places. Hint: pipe the coefficients to bc, using the well-known formula, x = ( -B +/- sqrt( B^2 - 4AC ) ) / 2A. Table of Logarithms Using the bc and printf commands, print out a nicely-formatted table of eight-place natural logarithms in the interval between 0.00 and 100.00, in steps of .01. Hint: bc requires the -l option to load the math library. Unicode Table Using Example T-1 as a template, write a script that prints to a file a complete Unicode table. Hint: Use the -e option to echo: echo -e '\uXXXX', where XXXX is the Unicode numerical character designation. This requires version 4.2 or later of Bash. Sum of Matching Numbers Find the sum of all five-digit numbers (in the range 10000 - 99999) containing exactly two out of the following set of digits: { 4, 5, 6 }. These may repeat within the same number, and if so, they count once for each occurrence. Some examples of matching numbers are 42057, 74638, and 89515. Lucky Numbers A lucky number is one whose individual digits add up to 7, in successive additions. For example, 62431 is a lucky number (6 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 1 = 16, 1 + 6 = 7). Find all the lucky numbers between 1000 and 10000. Craps Borrowing the ASCII graphics from Example A-40, write a script that plays the well-known gambling game of craps. The script will accept bets from one or more players, roll the dice, and keep track of wins and losses, as well as of each player's bankroll. Tic-tac-toe Write a script that plays the child's game of tic-tac-toe against a human player. The script will let the human choose whether to take the first move. The script will follow an optimal strategy, and therefore never lose. To simplify matters, you may use ASCII graphics: o | x | ---------- | x | ---------- | o | Your move, human (row, column)? Alphabetizing a String Alphabetize (in ASCII order) an arbitrary string read from the command-line. Parsing Parse /etc/passwd, and output its contents in nice, easy-to-read tabular form. Logging Logins Parse /var/log/messages to produce a nicely formatted file of user logins and login times. The script may need to run as root. (Hint: Search for the string &quot;LOGIN.&quot;) Pretty-Printing a Data File Certain database and spreadsheet packages use save-files with the fields separated by commas, commonly referred to as comma-separated values or CSVs. Other applications often need to parse these files. Given a data file with comma-separated fields, of the form: Jones,Bill,235 S. Williams St.,Denver,CO,80221,(303) 244-7989 Smith,Tom,404 Polk Ave.,Los Angeles,CA,90003,(213) 879-5612 ... Reformat the data and print it out to stdout in labeled, evenly-spaced columns. Justification Given ASCII text input either from stdin or a file, adjust the word spacing to right-justify each line to a user-specified line-width, then send the output to stdout. Mailing List Using the mail command, write a script that manages a simple mailing list. The script automatically e-mails the monthly company newsletter, read from a specified text file, and sends it to all the addresses on the mailing list, which the script reads from another specified file. Generating Passwords Generate pseudorandom 8-character passwords, using characters in the ranges [0-9], [A-Z], [a-z]. Each password must contain at least two digits. Monitoring a User You suspect that one particular user on the network has been abusing her privileges and possibly attempting to hack the system. Write a script to automatically monitor and log her activities when she's signed on. The log file will save entries for the previous week, and delete those entries more than seven days old. You may use last, lastlog, and lastcomm to aid your surveillance of the suspected fiend. Checking for Broken Links Using lynx with the -traversal option, write a script that checks a Web site for broken links. DIFFICULT Testing Passwords Write a script to check and validate passwords. The object is to flag &quot;weak&quot; or easily guessed password candidates. A trial password will be input to the script as a command-line parameter. To be considered acceptable, a password must meet the following minimum qualifications: Minimum length of 8 characters Must contain at least one numeric character Must contain at least one of the following non-alphabetic characters: @, #, $, %, &amp;, *, +, -, = Optional: Do a dictionary check on every sequence of at least four consecutive alphabetic characters in the password under test. This will eliminate passwords containing embedded &quot;words&quot; found in a standard dictionary. Enable the script to check all the passwords on your system. These do not reside in /etc/passwd. This exercise tests mastery of Regular Expressions. Cross Reference Write a script that generates a cross-reference (concordance) on a target file. The output will be a listing of all word occurrences in the target file, along with the line numbers in which each word occurs. Traditionally, linked list constructs would be used in such applications. Therefore, you should investigate arrays in the course of this exercise. Example 16-12 is probably not a good place to start. Square Root Write a script to calculate square roots of numbers using Newton's Method. The algorithm for this, expressed as a snippet of Bash pseudo-code is: # (Isaac) Newton's Method for speedy extraction #+ of square roots. guess = $argument # $argument is the number to find the square root of. # $guess is each successive calculated &quot;guess&quot; -- or trial solution -- #+ of the square root. # Our first &quot;guess&quot; at a square root is the argument itself. oldguess = 0 # $oldguess is the previous $guess. tolerance = .000001 # To how close a tolerance we wish to calculate. loopcnt = 0 # Let's keep track of how many times through the loop. # Some arguments will require more loop iterations than others. while [ ABS( $guess $oldguess ) -gt $tolerance ] # ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Fix up syntax, of course. # &quot;ABS&quot; is a (floating point) function to find the absolute value #+ of the difference between the two terms. # So, as long as difference between current and previous #+ trial solution (guess) exceeds the tolerance, keep looping. do oldguess = $guess # Update $oldguess to previous $guess. # ======================================================= guess = ( $oldguess + ( $argument / $oldguess ) ) / 2.0 # = 1/2 ( ($oldguess **2 + $argument) / $oldguess ) # equivalent to: # = 1/2 ( $oldguess + $argument / $oldguess ) # that is, &quot;averaging out&quot; the trial solution and #+ the proportion of argument deviation #+ (in effect, splitting the error in half). # This converges on an accurate solution #+ with surprisingly few loop iterations . . . #+ for arguments &gt; $tolerance, of course. # ======================================================= (( loopcnt++ )) # Update loop counter. done It's a simple enough recipe, and seems at first glance easy enough to convert into a working Bash script. The problem, though, is that Bash has no native support for floating point numbers. So, the script writer needs to use bc or possibly awk to convert the numbers and do the calculations. It could get rather messy . . . Logging File Accesses Log all accesses to the files in /etc during the course of a single day. This information should include the filename, user name, and access time. If any alterations to the files take place, that will be flagged. Write this data as tabular (tab-separated) formatted records in a logfile. Monitoring Processes Write a script to continually monitor all running processes and to keep track of how many child processes each parent spawns. If a process spawns more than five children, then the script sends an e-mail to the system administrator (or root) with all relevant information, including the time, PID of the parent, PIDs of the children, etc. The script appends a report to a log file every ten minutes. Strip Comments Strip all comments from a shell script whose name is specified on the command-line. Note that the initial #! line must not be stripped out. Strip HTML Tags Strip all the HTML tags from a specified HTML file, then reformat it into lines between 60 and 75 characters in length. Reset paragraph and block spacing, as appropriate, and convert HTML tables to their approximate text equivalent. XML Conversion Convert an XML file to both HTML and text format. Optional: A script that converts Docbook/SGML to XML. Chasing Spammers Write a script that analyzes a spam e-mail by doing DNS lookups on the IP addresses in the headers to identify the relay hosts as well as the originating ISP. The script will forward the unaltered spam message to the responsible ISPs. Of course, it will be necessary to filter out your own ISP's IP address, so you don't end up complaining about yourself. As necessary, use the appropriate network analysis commands. For some ideas, see Example 16-41 and Example A-28. Optional: Write a script that searches through a list of e-mail messages and deletes the spam according to specified filters. Creating man pages Write a script that automates the process of creating man pages. Given a text file which contains information to be formatted into a man page, the script will read the file, then invoke the appropriate groff commands to output the corresponding man page to stdout. The text file contains blocks of information under the standard man page headings, i.e., NAME, SYNOPSIS, DESCRIPTION, etc. Example A-39 is an instructive first step. Hex Dump Do a hex(adecimal) dump on a binary file specified as an argument to the script. The output should be in neat tabular fields, with the first field showing the address, each of the next 8 fields a 4-byte hex number, and the final field the ASCII equivalent of the previous 8 fields. The obvious followup to this is to extend the hex dump script into a disassembler. Using a lookup table, or some other clever gimmick, convert the hex values into 80x86 op codes. Emulating a Shift Register Using Example 27-15 as an inspiration, write a script that emulates a 64-bit shift register as an array. Implement functions to load the register, shift left, shift right, and rotate it. Finally, write a function that interprets the register contents as eight 8-bit ASCII characters. Calculating Determinants Write a script that calculates determinants [153] by recursively expanding the minors. Use a 4 x 4 determinant as a test case. Hidden Words Write a &quot;word-find&quot; puzzle generator, a script that hides 10 input words in a 10 x 10 array of random letters. The words may be hidden across, down, or diagonally. Optional: Write a script that solves word-find puzzles. To keep this from becoming too difficult, the solution script will find only horizontal and vertical words. (Hint: Treat each row and column as a string, and search for substrings.) Anagramming Anagram 4-letter input. For example, the anagrams of word are: do or rod row word. You may use /usr/share/dict/linux.words as the reference list. Word Ladders A &quot;word ladder&quot; is a sequence of words, with each successive word in the sequence differing from the previous one by a single letter. For example, to &quot;ladder&quot; from mark to vase: mark --&gt; park --&gt; part --&gt; past --&gt; vast --&gt; vase ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ Write a script that solves word ladder puzzles. Given a starting and an ending word, the script will list all intermediate steps in the &quot;ladder.&quot; Note that all words in the sequence must be legitimate dictionary words. Fog Index The &quot;fog index&quot; of a passage of text estimates its reading difficulty, as a number corresponding roughly to a school grade level. For example, a passage with a fog index of 12 should be comprehensible to anyone with 12 years of schooling. The Gunning version of the fog index uses the following algorithm. Choose a section of the text at least 100 words in length. Count the number of sentences (a portion of a sentence truncated by the boundary of the text section counts as one). Find the average number of words per sentence. AVE_WDS_SEN = TOTAL_WORDS / SENTENCES Count the number of &quot;difficult&quot; words in the segment -- those containing at least 3 syllables. Divide this quantity by total words to get the proportion of difficult words. PRO_DIFF_WORDS = LONG_WORDS / TOTAL_WORDS The Gunning fog index is the sum of the above two quantities, multiplied by 0.4, then rounded to the nearest integer. G_FOG_INDEX = int ( 0.4 * ( AVE_WDS_SEN + PRO_DIFF_WORDS ) ) Step 4 is by far the most difficult portion of the exercise. There exist various algorithms for estimating the syllable count of a word. A rule-of-thumb formula might consider the number of letters in a word and the vowel-consonant mix. A strict interpretation of the Gunning fog index does not count compound words and proper nouns as &quot;difficult&quot; words, but this would enormously complicate the script. Calculating PI using Buffon's Needle The Eighteenth Century French mathematician de Buffon came up with a novel experiment. Repeatedly drop a needle of length n onto a wooden floor composed of long and narrow parallel boards. The cracks separating the equal-width floorboards are a fixed distance d apart. Keep track of the total drops and the number of times the needle intersects a crack on the floor. The ratio of these two quantities turns out to be a fractional multiple of PI. In the spirit of Example 16-50, write a script that runs a Monte Carlo simulation of Buffon's Needle. To simplify matters, set the needle length equal to the distance between the cracks, n = d. Hint: there are actually two critical variables: the distance from the center of the needle to the nearest crack, and the inclination angle of the needle to that crack. You may use bc to handle the calculations. Playfair Cipher Implement the Playfair (Wheatstone) Cipher in a script. The Playfair Cipher encrypts text by substitution of digrams (2-letter groupings). It is traditional to use a 5 x 5 letter scrambled-alphabet key square for the encryption and decryption. C O D E S A B F G H I K L M N P Q R T U V W X Y Z Each letter of the alphabet appears once, except &quot;I&quot; also represents &quot;J&quot;. The arbitrarily chosen key word, &quot;CODES&quot; comes first, then all the rest of the alphabet, in order from left to right, skipping letters already used. To encrypt, separate the plaintext message into digrams (2-letter groups). If a group has two identical letters, delete the second, and form a new group. If there is a single letter left over at the end, insert a &quot;null&quot; character, typically an &quot;X.&quot; THIS IS A TOP SECRET MESSAGE TH IS IS AT OP SE CR ET ME SA GE For each digram, there are three possibilities. ----------------------------------------------- 1) Both letters will be on the same row of the key square: For each letter, substitute the one immediately to the right, in that row. If necessary, wrap around left to the beginning of the row. or 2) Both letters will be in the same column of the key square: For each letter, substitute the one immediately below it, in that row. If necessary, wrap around to the top of the column. or 3) Both letters will form the corners of a rectangle within the key square: For each letter, substitute the one on the other corner the rectangle which lies on the same row. The &quot;TH&quot; digram falls under case #3. G H M N T U (Rectangle with &quot;T&quot; and &quot;H&quot; at corners) T --&gt; U H --&gt; G The &quot;SE&quot; digram falls under case #1. C O D E S (Row containing &quot;S&quot; and &quot;E&quot;) S --&gt; C (wraps around left to beginning of row) E --&gt; S ========================================================================= To decrypt encrypted text, reverse the above procedure under cases #1 and #2 (move in opposite direction for substitution). Under case #3, just take the remaining two corners of the rectangle. Helen Fouche Gaines' classic work, ELEMENTARY CRYPTANALYSIS (1939), gives a fairly detailed description of the Playfair Cipher and its solution methods. This script will have three main sections Generating the key square, based on a user-input keyword. Encrypting a plaintext message. Decrypting encrypted text. The script will make extensive use of arrays and functions. You may use Example A-56 as an inspiration. -- Please do not send the author your solutions to these exercises. There are more appropriate ways to impress him with your cleverness, such as submitting bugfixes and suggestions for improving the book. Appendix P. Revision History This document first appeared as a 60-page HOWTO in the late spring of 2000. Since then, it has gone through quite a number of updates and revisions. This book could not have been written without the assistance of the Linux community, and especially of the volunteers of the Linux Documentation Project. Here is the e-mail to the LDP requesting permission to submit version 0.1. From thegrendel@theriver.com Sat Jun 10 09:05:33 2000 -0700 Date: Sat, 10 Jun 2000 09:05:28 -0700 (MST) From: &quot;M. Leo Cooper&quot; &lt;thegrendel@theriver.com&gt; X-Sender: thegrendel@localhost To: ldp-discuss@lists.linuxdoc.org Subject: Permission to submit HOWTO Dear HOWTO Coordinator, I am working on and would like to submit to the LDP a HOWTO on the subject of &quot;Bash Scripting&quot; (shell scripting, using 'bash'). As it happens, I have been writing this document, off and on, for about the last eight months or so, and I could produce a first draft in ASCII text format in a matter of just a few more days. I began writing this out of frustration at being unable to find a decent book on shell scripting. I managed to locate some pretty good articles on various aspects of scripting, but nothing like a complete, beginning-to-end tutorial. Well, in keeping with my philosophy, if all else fails, do it yourself. As it stands, this proposed &quot;Bash-Scripting HOWTO&quot; would serve as a combination tutorial and reference, with the heavier emphasis on the tutorial. It assumes Linux experience, but only a very basic level of programming skills. Interspersed with the text are 79 illustrative example scripts of varying complexity, all liberally commented. There are even exercises for the reader. At this stage, I'm up to 18,000+ words (124k), and that's over 50 pages of text (whew!). I haven't mentioned that I've previously authored an LDP HOWTO, the &quot;Software-Building HOWTO&quot;, which I wrote in Linuxdoc/SGML. I don't know if I could handle Docbook/SGML, and I'm glad you have volunteers to do the conversion. You people seem to have gotten on a more organized basis these last few months. Working with Greg Hankins and Tim Bynum was nice, but a professional team is even nicer. Anyhow, please advise. Mendel Cooper thegrendel@theriver.com Table P-1.

ASCII Table Traditionally, a book of this sort has an ASCII Table appendix. This book does not. Instead, here are several short scripts, each of which generates a complete ASCII table. Example T-1.

[2] Although recursion is possible in a shell script, it tends to be slow and its implementation is often an ugly kludge. [3] An acronym is an ersatz word formed by pasting together the initial letters of the words into a tongue-tripping phrase. This morally corrupt and pernicious practice deserves appropriately severe punishment. Public flogging suggests itself. [4] Many of the features of ksh88, and even a few from the updated ksh93 have been merged into Bash. [5] By convention, user-written shell scripts that are Bourne shell compliant generally take a name with a .sh extension. System scripts, such as those found in /etc/rc.d, do not necessarily conform to this nomenclature. [6] More commonly seen in the literature as she-bang or sh-bang. This derives from the concatenation of the tokens sharp (#) and bang (!). [7] Some flavors of UNIX (those based on 4.2 BSD) allegedly take a four-byte magic number, requiring a blank after the ! -- #! /bin/sh. According to Sven Mascheck this is probably a myth. [8] The #! line in a shell script will be the first thing the command interpreter (sh or bash) sees. Since this line begins with a #, it will be correctly interpreted as a comment when the command interpreter finally executes the script. The line has already served its purpose - calling the command interpreter. If, in fact, the script includes an extra #! line, then bash will interpret it as a comment. #!/bin/bash echo &quot;Part 1 of script.&quot; a=1 #!/bin/bash # This does *not* launch a new script. echo &quot;Part 2 of script.&quot; echo $a # Value of $a stays at 1. [9] This allows some cute tricks. #!/bin/rm # Self-deleting script. # Nothing much seems to happen when you run this... except that the file disappears. WHATEVER=85 echo &quot;This line will never print (betcha!).&quot; exit $WHATEVER # Doesn't matter. The script will not exit here. # Try an echo $? after script termination. # You'll get a 0, not a 85. Also, try starting a README file with a #!/bin/more, and making it executable. The result is a self-listing documentation file. (A here document using cat is possibly a better alternative -- see Example 19-3). [10] Portable Operating System Interface, an attempt to standardize UNIX-like OSes. The POSIX specifications are listed on the Open Group site. [11] To avoid this possibility, a script may begin with a #!/bin/env bash sha-bang line. This may be useful on UNIX machines where bash is not located in /bin [12] If Bash is your default shell, then the #! isn't necessary at the beginning of a script. However, if launching a script from a different shell, such as tcsh, then you will need the #!. [13] Caution: invoking a Bash script by sh scriptname turns off Bash-specific extensions, and the script may therefore fail to execute. [14] A script needs read, as well as execute permission for it to run, since the shell needs to be able to read it. [15] Why not simply invoke the script with scriptname? If the directory you are in ($PWD) is where scriptname is located, why doesn't this work? This fails because, for security reasons, the current directory (./) is not by default included in a user's $PATH. It is therefore necessary to explicitly invoke the script in the current directory with a ./scriptname. [16] An operator is an agent that carries out an operation. Some examples are the common arithmetic operators, + - * /. In Bash, there is some overlap between the concepts of operator and keyword. [17] This is more commonly known as the ternary operator. Unfortunately, ternary is an ugly word. It doesn't roll off the tongue, and it doesn't elucidate. It obfuscates. Trinary is by far the more elegant usage. [18] American Standard Code for Information Interchange. This is a system for encoding text characters (alphabetic, numeric, and a limited set of symbols) as 7-bit numbers that can be stored and manipulated by computers. Many of the ASCII characters are represented on a standard keyboard. [19] A PID, or process ID, is a number assigned to a running process. The PIDs of running processes may be viewed with a ps command. Definition: A process is a currently executing command (or program), sometimes referred to as a job. [20] The shell does the brace expansion. The command itself acts upon the result of the expansion. [21] Exception: a code block in braces as part of a pipe may run as a subshell. ls | { read firstline; read secondline; } # Error. The code block in braces runs as a subshell, #+ so the output of &quot;ls&quot; cannot be passed to variables within the block. echo &quot;First line is $firstline; second line is $secondline&quot; # Won't work. # Thanks, S.C. [22] Even as in olden times a philtre denoted a potion alleged to have magical transformative powers, so does a UNIX filter transform its target in (roughly) analogous fashion. (The coder who comes up with a &quot;love philtre&quot; that runs on a Linux machine will likely win accolades and honors.) [23] Bash stores a list of commands previously issued from the command-line in a buffer, or memory space, for recall with the builtin history commands. [24] A linefeed (newline) is also a whitespace character. This explains why a blank line, consisting only of a linefeed, is considered whitespace. [25] Technically, the name of a variable is called an lvalue, meaning that it appears on the left side of an assignment statment, as in VARIABLE=23. A variable's value is an rvalue, meaning that it appears on the right side of an assignment statement, as in VAR2=$VARIABLE. A variable's name is, in fact, a reference, a pointer to the memory location(s) where the actual data associated with that variable is kept. [26] Note that functions also take positional parameters. [27] The process calling the script sets the $0 parameter. By convention, this parameter is the name of the script. See the manpage (manual page) for execv. From the command-line, however, $0 is the name of the shell. bash$ echo $0 bash tcsh% echo $0 tcsh [28] If the the script is sourced or symlinked, then this will not work. It is safer to check $BASH_Source. [29] Unless there is a file named first in the current working directory. Yet another reason to quote. (Thank you, Harald Koenig, for pointing this out. [30] Encapsulating &quot;!&quot; within double quotes gives an error when used from the command line. This is interpreted as a history command. Within a script, though, this problem does not occur, since the Bash history mechanism is disabled then. Of more concern is the apparently inconsistent behavior of \ within double quotes, and especially following an echo -e command. bash$ echo hello\! hello! bash$ echo &quot;hello\!&quot; hello\! bash$ echo \ &gt; bash$ echo &quot;\&quot; &gt; bash$ echo \a a bash$ echo &quot;\a&quot; \a bash$ echo x\ty xty bash$ echo &quot;x\ty&quot; x\ty bash$ echo -e x\ty xty bash$ echo -e &quot;x\ty&quot; x y Double quotes following an echo sometimes escape \. Moreover, the -e option to echo causes the &quot;\t&quot; to be interpreted as a tab. (Thank you, Wayne Pollock, for pointing this out, and Geoff Lee and Daniel Barclay for explaining it.) [31] &quot;Word splitting,&quot; in this context, means dividing a character string into separate and discrete arguments. [32] In those instances when there is no return terminating the function. [33] A token is a symbol or short string with a special meaning attached to it (a meta-meaning). In Bash, certain tokens, such as [ and . (dot-command), may expand to keywords and commands. [34] Per the 1913 edition of Webster's Dictionary: Deprecate ... To pray against, as an evil; to seek to avert by prayer; to desire the removal of; to seek deliverance from; to express deep regret for; to disapprove of strongly. [35] Be aware that suid binaries may open security holes. The suid flag has no effect on shell scripts. [36] On Linux systems, the sticky bit is no longer used for files, only on directories. [37] As S.C. points out, in a compound test, even quoting the string variable might not suffice. [ -n &quot;$string&quot; -o &quot;$a&quot; = &quot;$b&quot; ] may cause an error with some versions of Bash if $string is empty. The safe way is to append an extra character to possibly empty variables, [ &quot;x$string&quot; != x -o &quot;x$a&quot; = &quot;x$b&quot; ] (the &quot;x's&quot; cancel out). [38] In a different context, += can serve as a string concatenation operator. This can be useful for modifying environmental variables. [39] Side effects are, of course, unintended -- and usually undesirable -- consequences. [40] Precedence, in this context, has approximately the same meaning as priority [41] A stack register is a set of consecutive memory locations, such that the values stored (pushed) are retrieved (popped) in reverse order. The last value stored is the first retrieved. This is sometimes called a LIFO (last-in-first-out) or pushdown stack. [42] The PID of the currently running script is $$, of course. [43] Somewhat analogous to recursion, in this context nesting refers to a pattern embedded within a larger pattern. One of the definitions of nest, according to the 1913 edition of Webster's Dictionary, illustrates this beautifully: &quot;A collection of boxes, cases, or the like, of graduated size, each put within the one next larger.&quot; [44] The words &quot;argument&quot; and &quot;parameter&quot; are often used interchangeably. In the context of this document, they have the same precise meaning: a variable passed to a script or function. [45] Within a script, inside a subshell, $$ returns the PID of the script, not the subshell. [46] In this context, typing a variable means to classify it and restrict its properties. For example, a variable declared or typed as an integer is no longer available for string operations. declare -i intvar intvar=23 echo &quot;$intvar&quot; # 23 intvar=stringval echo &quot;$intvar&quot; # 0 [47] True &quot;randomness,&quot; insofar as it exists at all, can only be found in certain incompletely understood natural phenomena, such as radioactive decay. Computers only simulate randomness, and computer-generated sequences of &quot;random&quot; numbers are therefore referred to as pseudorandom. [48] The seed of a computer-generated pseudorandom number series can be considered an identification label. For example, think of the pseudorandom series with a seed of 23 as Series #23. A property of a pseurandom number series is the length of the cycle before it starts repeating itself. A good pseurandom generator will produce series with very long cycles. [49] This applies to either command-line arguments or parameters passed to a function. [50] Note that $substring and $replacement may refer to either literal strings or variables, depending on context. See the first usage example. [51] If $parameter is null in a non-interactive script, it will terminate with a 127 exit status (the Bash error code for &quot;command not found&quot;). [52] Iteration: Repeated execution of a command or group of commands, usually -- but not always, while a given condition holds, or until a given condition is met. [53] These are shell builtins, whereas other loop commands, such as while and case, are keywords. [54] Pattern-match lines may also start with a ( left paren to give the layout a more structured appearance. case $( arch ) in # $( arch ) returns machine architecture. ( i386 ) echo &quot;80386-based machine&quot;;; # ^ ^ ( i486 ) echo &quot;80486-based machine&quot;;; ( i586 ) echo &quot;Pentium-based machine&quot;;; ( i686 ) echo &quot;Pentium2+-based machine&quot;;; ( * ) echo &quot;Other type of machine&quot;;; esac [55] For purposes of command substitution, a command may be an external system command, an internal scripting builtin, or even a script function. [56] In a more technically correct sense, command substitution extracts the stdout of a command, then assigns it to a variable using the = operator. [57] In fact, nesting with backticks is also possible, but only by escaping the inner backticks, as John Default points out. word_count=` wc -w \`echo * | awk '{print $8}'\` ` [58] As Nathan Coulter points out, &quot;while forking a process is a low-cost operation, executing a new program in the newly-forked child process adds more overhead.&quot; [59] An exception to this is the time command, listed in the official Bash documentation as a keyword (&quot;reserved word&quot;). [60] Note that let cannot be used for setting string variables. [61] To Export information is to make it available in a more general context. See also scope. [62] An option is an argument that acts as a flag, switching script behaviors on or off. The argument associated with a particular option indicates the behavior that the option (flag) switches on or off. [63] Technically, an exit only terminates the process (or shell) in which it is running, not the parent process. [64] Unless the exec is used to reassign file descriptors. [65] Hashing is a method of creating lookup keys for data stored in a table. The data items themselves are &quot;scrambled&quot; to create keys, using one of a number of simple mathematical algorithms (methods, or recipes). An advantage of hashing is that it is fast. A disadvantage is that collisions -- where a single key maps to more than one data item -- are possible. For examples of hashing see Example A-20 and Example A-21. [66] The readline library is what Bash uses for reading input in an interactive shell. [67] This only applies to child processes, of course. [68] The C source for a number of loadable builtins is typically found in the /usr/share/doc/bash-?.??/functions directory. Note that the -f option to enable is not portable to all systems. [69] The same effect as autoload can be achieved with typeset -fu. [70] The -v option also orders the sort by upper- and lowercase prefixed filenames. [71] Dotfiles are files whose names begin with a dot, such as ~/.Xdefaults. Such filenames do not appear in a normal ls listing (although an ls -a will show them), and they cannot be deleted by an accidental rm -rf *. Dotfiles are generally used as setup and configuration files in a user's home directory. [72] This particular feature may not yet be implemented in the version of the ext2/ext3 filesystem installed on your system. Check the documentation for your Linux distro. [73] And even when xargs is not strictly necessary, it can speed up execution of a command involving batch-processing of multiple files. [74] This is only true of the GNU version of tr, not the generic version often found on commercial UNIX systems. [75] An archive, in the sense discussed here, is simply a set of related files stored in a single location. [76] A tar czvf ArchiveName.tar.gz * will include dotfiles in subdirectories below the current working directory. This is an undocumented GNU tar &quot;feature.&quot; [77] The checksum may be expressed as a hexadecimal number, or to some other base. [78] For even better security, use the sha256sum, sha512, and sha1pass commands. [79] This is a symmetric block cipher, used to encrypt files on a single system or local network, as opposed to the public key cipher class, of which pgp is a well-known example. [80] Creates a temporary directory when invoked with the -d option. [81] A daemon is a background process not attached to a terminal session. Daemons perform designated services either at specified times or explicitly triggered by certain events. The word &quot;daemon&quot; means ghost in Greek, and there is certainly something mysterious, almost supernatural, about the way UNIX daemons wander about behind the scenes, silently carrying out their appointed tasks. [82] This is actually a script adapted from the Debian Linux distribution. [83] The print queue is the group of jobs &quot;waiting in line&quot; to be printed. [84] Large mechanical line printers printed a single line of type at a time onto joined sheets of greenbar paper, to the accompaniment of a great deal of noise. The hardcopy thusly printed was referred to as a printout. [85] For an excellent overview of this topic, see Andy Vaught's article, Introduction to Named Pipes, in the September, 1997 issue of Linux Journal. [86] EBCDIC (pronounced &quot;ebb-sid-ick&quot;) is an acronym for Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code, an obsolete IBM data format. A bizarre application of the conv=ebcdic option of dd is as a quick 'n easy, but not very secure text file encoder. cat $file | dd conv=swab,ebcdic &gt; $file_encrypted # Encode (looks like gibberish). # Might as well switch bytes (swab), too, for a little extra obscurity. cat $file_encrypted | dd conv=swab,ascii &gt; $file_plaintext # Decode. [87] A macro is a symbolic constant that expands into a command string or a set of operations on parameters. Simply put, it's a shortcut or abbreviation. [88] This is the case on a Linux machine or a UNIX system with disk quotas. [89] The userdel command will fail if the particular user being deleted is still logged on. [90] For more detail on burning CDRs, see Alex Withers' article, Creating CDs, in the October, 1999 issue of Linux Journal. [91] The -c option to mke2fs also invokes a check for bad blocks. [92] Since only root has write permission in the /var/lock directory, a user script cannot set a lock file there. [93] Operators of single-user Linux systems generally prefer something simpler for backups, such as tar. [94] As of the version 4 update of Bash, the -f and -c options take a block size of 512 when in POSIX mode. Additionally, there are two new options: -b for socket buffer size, and -T for the limit on the number of threads. [95] NAND is the logical not-and operator. Its effect is somewhat similar to subtraction. [96] In Bash and other Bourne shell derivatives, it is possible to set variables in a single command's environment. var1=value1 var2=value2 commandXXX # $var1 and $var2 set in the environment of 'commandXXX' only. [97] The killall system script should not be confused with the killall command in /usr/bin. [98] A meta-meaning is the meaning of a term or expression on a higher level of abstraction. For example, the literal meaning of regular expression is an ordinary expression that conforms to accepted usage. The meta-meaning is drastically different, as discussed at length in this chapter. [99] Since sed, awk, and grep process single lines, there will usually not be a newline to match. In those cases where there is a newline in a multiple line expression, the dot will match the newline. #!/bin/bash sed -e 'N;s/.*/[&amp;]/' &lt;&lt; EOF # Here Document line1 line2 EOF # OUTPUT: # [line1 # line2] echo awk '{ $0=$1 &quot;\n&quot; $2; if (/line.1/) {print}}' &lt;&lt; EOF line 1 line 2 EOF # OUTPUT: # line # 1 # Thanks, S.C. exit 0 [100] Filename expansion means expanding filename patterns or templates containing special characters. For example, example.??? might expand to example.001 and/or example.txt. [101] A wild card character, analogous to a wild card in poker, can represent (almost) any other character. [102] Filename expansion can match dotfiles, but only if the pattern explicitly includes the dot as a literal character. ~/[.]bashrc # Will not expand to ~/.bashrc ~/?bashrc # Neither will this. # Wild cards and metacharacters will NOT #+ expand to a dot in globbing. ~/.[b]ashrc # Will expand to ~/.bashrc ~/.ba?hrc # Likewise. ~/.bashr* # Likewise. # Setting the &quot;dotglob&quot; option turns this off. # Thanks, S.C. [103] Except, as Dennis Benzinger points out, if using &lt;&lt;- to suppress tabs. [104] By convention in UNIX and Linux, data streams and peripherals (device files) are treated as files, in a fashion analogous to ordinary files. [105] A file descriptor is simply a number that the operating system assigns to an open file to keep track of it. Consider it a simplified type of file pointer. It is analogous to a file handle in C. [106] Using file descriptor 5 might cause problems. When Bash creates a child process, as with exec, the child inherits fd 5 (see Chet Ramey's archived e-mail, SUBJECT: RE: File descriptor 5 is held open). Best leave this particular fd alone. [107] An external command invoked with an exec does not (usually) fork off a subprocess / subshell. [108] This has the same effect as a named pipe (temp file), and, in fact, named pipes were at one time used in process substitution. [109] The return command is a Bash builtin. [110] However, as Thomas Braunberger points out, a local variable declared in a function is also visible to functions called by the parent function. #!/bin/bash function1 () { local func1var=20 echo &quot;Within function1, \$func1var = $func1var.&quot; function2 } function2 () { echo &quot;Within function2, \$func1var = $func1var.&quot; } function1 exit 0 # Output of the script: # Within function1, $func1var = 20. # Within function2, $func1var = 20. This is documented in the Bash manual: &quot;Local can only be used within a function; it makes the variable name have a visible scope restricted to that function and its children.&quot; [emphasis added] The ABS Guide author considers this behavior to be a bug. [111] Otherwise known as redundancy. [112] Otherwise known as tautology. [113] Otherwise known as a metaphor. [114] Otherwise known as a recursive function. [115] Too many levels of recursion may crash a script with a segfault. #!/bin/bash # Warning: Running this script could possibly lock up your system! # If you're lucky, it will segfault before using up all available memory. recursive_function () { echo &quot;$1&quot; # Makes the function do something, and hastens the segfault. (( $1 &lt; $2 )) &amp;&amp; recursive_function $(( $1 + 1 )) $2; # As long as 1st parameter is less than 2nd, #+ increment 1st and recurse. } recursive_function 1 50000 # Recurse 50,000 levels! # Most likely segfaults (depending on stack size, set by ulimit -m). # Recursion this deep might cause even a C program to segfault, #+ by using up all the memory allotted to the stack. echo &quot;This will probably not print.&quot; exit 0 # This script will not exit normally. # Thanks, Stéphane Chazelas. [116] ... as the first word of a command string. Obviously, an alias is only meaningful at the beginning of a command. [117] However, aliases do seem to expand positional parameters. [118] The entries in /dev provide mount points for physical and virtual devices. These entries use very little drive space. Some devices, such as /dev/null, /dev/zero, and /dev/urandom are virtual. They are not actual physical devices and exist only in software. [119] A block device reads and/or writes data in chunks, or blocks, in contrast to a character device, which acesses data in character units. Examples of block devices are hard drives, CDROM drives, and flash drives. Examples of character devices are keyboards, modems, sound cards. [120] Of course, the mount point /mnt/flashdrive must exist. If not, then, as root, mkdir /mnt/flashdrive. To actually mount the drive, use the following command: mount /mnt/flashdrive Newer Linux distros automount flash drives in the /media directory without user intervention. [121] Certain system commands, such as procinfo, free, vmstat, lsdev, and uptime do this as well. [122] By convention, signal 0 is assigned to exit. [123] Setting the suid permission on the script itself has no effect in Linux and most other UNIX flavors. [124] In this context, &quot;magic numbers&quot; have an entirely different meaning than the magic numbers used to designate file types. [125] Quite a number of Linux utilities are, in fact, shell wrappers. Some examples are /usr/bin/pdf2ps, /usr/bin/batch, and /usr/bin/xmkmf. [126] ANSI is, of course, the acronym for the American National Standards Institute. This august body establishes and maintains various technical and industrial standards. [127] This usually means liberal use of functions. [128] See Marius van Oers' article, Unix Shell Scripting Malware, and also the Denning reference in the bibliography. [129] Or, better yet, #!/bin/env sh. [130] To be more specific, Bash 4+ has limited support for associative arrays. It's a bare-bones implementation, and it lacks the much of the functionality of such arrays in other programming languages. Note, however, that associative arrays in Bash seem to execute faster and more efficiently than numerically-indexed arrays. [131] Copyright 1995-2009 by Chester Ramey. [132] This only works with pipes and certain other special files. [133] But only in conjunction with readline, i.e., from the command-line. [134] And while you're at it, consider fixing the notorious piped read problem. [135] This is the notorious flog it to death technique that works so well with slow learners, eccentrics, odd ducks, fools and geniuses. [136] In fact, he has no credentials or special qualifications. He's a school dropout with no formal credentials or professional experience whatsoever. None. Zero. Nada. Aside from the ABS Guide, his major claim to fame is a First Place in the sack race at the Colfax Elementary School Field Day in June, 1958. [137] Those who can, do. Those who can't . . . get an MCSE. [138] Sometimes it seems as if he has spent his entire life flouting conventional wisdom and defying the sonorous Voice of Authority: &quot;Hey, you can't do that!&quot; [139] Well, if you absolutely insist, you can try modifying Example A-44 to suit your purposes. [140] It was hard to resist the obvious pun. No slight intended, since the book is a pretty decent introduction to the basic concepts of shell scripting. [141] Sed executes without user intervention. [142] If no address range is specified, the default is all lines. [143] Its name derives from the initials of its authors, Aho, Weinberg, and Kernighan. [144] Out of range exit values can result in unexpected exit codes. An exit value greater than 255 returns an exit code modulo 256. For example, exit 3809 gives an exit code of 225 (3809 % 256 = 225). [145] An update of /usr/include/sysexits.h allocates previously unused exit codes from 64 - 78. It may be anticipated that the range of unallotted exit codes will be further restricted in the future. The author of this document will not do fixups on the scripting examples to conform to the changing standard. This should not cause any problems, since there is no overlap or conflict in usage of exit codes between compiled C/C++ binaries and shell scripts. [146] This does not apply to csh, tcsh, and other shells not related to or descended from the classic Bourne shell (sh). [147] In older versions of UNIX, passwords were stored in /etc/passwd, and that explains the name of the file. [148] Some early UNIX systems had a fast, small-capacity fixed disk (containing /, the root partition), and a second drive which was larger, but slower (containing /usr and other partitions). The most frequently used programs and utilities therefore resided on the small-but-fast drive, in /bin, and the others on the slower drive, in /usr/bin. This likewise accounts for the split between /sbin and /usr/sbin, /lib and /usr/lib, etc. [149] This works only from the command line, of course, and not within a script. [150] Normally the default parameter completion files reside in either the /etc/profile.d directory or in /etc/bash_completion. These autoload on system startup. So, after writing a useful completion script, you might wish to move it (as root, of course) to one of these directories. [151] It has been extensively documented that programmers are willing to put in long hours of effort in order to save ten minutes of &quot;unnecessary&quot; labor. This is known as optimization. [152] Various readers have suggested modifications of the above batch file to prettify it and make it more compact and efficient. In the opinion of the ABS Guide author, this is wasted effort. A Bash script can access a DOS filesystem, or even an NTFS partition (with the help of ntfs-3g) to do batch or scripted operations. [153] For all you clever types who failed intermediate algebra, a determinant is a numerical value associated with a multidimensional matrix (array of numbers). For the simple case of a 2 x 2 determinant: |a b| |b a| The solution is a*a - b*b, where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; represent numbers. "

This is a very useful feature of the BBB, as within a typical university network student laptops/tablets/phones have access via WiFi and to get started with a networked embedded system you typically need a wired network connection. Often for security reasons there are restrictions on IP traffic between networks, making getting started over Ethernet very difficult. The alternative is cross-over cables but this can make Internet access difficult. This video looks at how you can set up the BBB to use the USB network adapter under Windows making initial configuration very straightforward and resulting in the BBB having full internet connectivity. The scripts mentioned in this video and source code examples are listed below: StartUSBNetwork: Shell #!/bin/sh echo &quot;Setup script for the EE402 module - Derek Molloy&quot; echo &quot;Setting up the default gateway&quot; /sbin/route add default gw 192.168.7.1 echo &quot;Updating the nameserver entry&quot; echo &quot;nameserver 8.8.8.8&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/resolv.conf echo &quot;Setting the time using the Irish ntp pool&quot; /usr/bin/ntpdate -b -s -u ie.pool.ntp.org 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 #!/bin/sh echo &quot;Setup script for the EE402 module - Derek Molloy&quot; echo &quot;Setting up the default gateway&quot; /sbin/route add default gw 192.168.7.1 echo &quot;Updating the nameserver entry&quot; echo &quot;nameserver 8.8.8.8&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/resolv.conf echo &quot;Setting the time using the Irish ntp pool&quot; /usr/bin/ntpdate -b -s -u ie.pool.ntp.org The git configuration: [http] sslVerify = true sslCAinfo = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt 1 2 3 [http] sslVerify = true sslCAinfo = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt And the source code: C++ #include&lt;iostream&gt; using namespace std; int main(){ cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello from the Beaglebone Black (cpp)!&quot; &lt;&lt; endl; } 1 2 3 4 5 6 #include&lt;iostream&gt; using namespace std; int main(){ cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello from the Beaglebone Black (cpp)!&quot; &lt;&lt; endl; } With the build configuration: Shell #!/bin/bash echo &quot;EE402 - Building the Test C++ Program on the Beaglebone Black&quot; g++ test.cpp -o test echo &quot;Finished&quot; 1 2 3 4 #!/bin/bash echo &quot;EE402 - Building the Test C++ Program on the Beaglebone Black&quot; g++ test.cpp -o test echo &quot;Finished&quot; 85 Comments Nigel Brown November 20, 2013 at 9:12 am - Reply Thanks Derek, another great video. Can we also have some details on how to achieve the same on OSX please. Gary Hoffman December 21, 2013 at 5:20 am - Reply Getting Mac OS X to share its internet connection with the BBB is very similar to the Windows method Derek shows here. You can enable Internet Sharing in the sharing tab of System Preferences and choose to share the Internet with the BeagleBone’s USB connection. It appears to be straightforward…but, alas, it doesn’t work for me. I can’t get BBB to route through that connection. James August 17, 2014 at 8:52 pm - Reply did you ever figure this out?

I have never used anything other than Windows platform. So guide me accordingly. 2. I have gone through several tutorials, projects on the internet. What I see is the BBB is connected via ethernet/USB to a computer.(I am not talking about the power supply, an adapter will work too). In some projects there is BBB working as the only processing device, no computer is connected. I want the same for my project. Is there any tutorial describing a way how to go about making a project independent of computer? Or I am lacking some basic knowledge on this issue? 3. I find tutorials on based specifically on Beagleboard, Beagleboard xM or Beaglebone. What are general changes/precautions I should take before implementing for Beaglebone Black? Or should I stick to only those tutorials that have information solely for BBB?

Derek February 3, 2014 at 10:06 pm - Reply It is possible that the Windows firewall is blocking your ping. You could temporarily disable the windows firewall to see if it is the problem. If it is you could add a new rule in order that you can re-enable the firewall. This is what I did before: Go to: Control Panel -&gt; System and security -&gt; Windows Firewall -&gt; Advanced settings -&gt; Inbound rules -&gt; New rule -&gt; Custom (custom rule) Press next. In “Protocol and ports” choose protocol type “ICMPv4” then press on “Customize”, then choose “Specific ICMP types”, check the box “echo request” then OK out of the settings. On the previous panel just choose defaults “Any IP address”, press next, “Allow the Connection”, apply the rule to all of Domain, Private and Public, can call it “Beaglebone Ping Rule” and press Finish.

I have also set /sbin/route add default gw 192.168.7.1 However, when I try to ping to 8.8.8.8 it is not working with a 100% packet loss. Anyways, I have continued with the procedure, and I have been able to modify resolv.conf by adding the nameserver 8.8.8.8. Then, I tried to ping http://www.google.com and the output I get is PING http://www.google.com (74.125.225.244) 56(84) bytes of data. But that is it, so I hit CTRL+C, and again 100% packet loss.

You seem to have to type “sudo su -” before you can change the ip_forward setting. I’m not sure why. Once you are in root shell you can set the value. To enable root login under Ubuntu type “sudo passwd root”. You can remove it again if you wish by typing “sudo passwd -l root” Derek.

Did you go back and reset the RNDIS settings to use DHCP after they magically change? If you don’t do that then it won’t work. One other thing to check is that firewall software is not blocking outgoing pings. I have seen that before. Derek Joe June 17, 2014 at 5:19 pm - Reply Derek, I have been watching your video series on Arduino and now Beaglebone. Your videos are excellent and I thank you for posting them. Regarding this particular video on the BBB network connection, I was able to follow it and it worked great one time. I now have encountered the situation where my network connection indicates “unidentified network limited no internet access” when I attach the BBB through the USB. I have scoured the internet in search of the solution but cannot solve this one. I’m not entirely certain weather it is a Beaglebone issue or a windows 8 issue. Like I said earlier your instruction here worked perfectly once so I was hoping you could help. Thank you Derek June 18, 2014 at 10:29 pm - Reply Thanks Joe, Performing the steps: /sbin/route add default gw 192.168.7.1 and modifying /etc/network/interfaces and adding the line: dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 fixes most USB network problems in the Debian image should work fine. I’ll have to try that again in work as maybe something has changed with the latest image.

Thanks. Brian July 23, 2014 at 6:08 pm - Reply Hi, I have been going through this video series and have found it to be one of the most useful resources for working with the beaglebone. Unfortunately I’ve run into an issue where I no longer have internet access through usb connection to my windows 7 pc using the latest image of debian. I was able to complete this tutorial in the past, but it no longer seems to be working for some reason, and it seems like others have experienced similar issues (maybe Joe above). Essentially, I am able to ping 192.168.7.1. When I try to ping http://www.google.com it returns “unkown host” as expected. After ” /sbin/route add default gw 192.168.7.1 ” however, I am unable to ping 8.8.8.8. Also, if I try to ping http://www.google.com after that step, nothing happens (i.e. “unknown host” no longer appears). “echo “nameserver 8.8.8.8″ &gt;&gt; /etc/resolv.conf” does nothing at this point since I cannot ping 8.8.8.8. When I go to Control Panel&gt;&gt;Network and Internet&gt;&gt;Network and Sharing&gt;&gt;Change adaptor settings&gt;&gt;Local Area Connection properties&gt;&gt;Sharing, checking “Allow other network users to connect” does not produce a drop down menu as in the video. It also doesn’t change my BBB IP settings to static. Adding “dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8″ &gt;&gt; /etc/network/interfaces” results in “network is unreachable” when attempting to ping 8.8.8.8. I also turned off the windows firewall and this had no effect. I’m really reaching the end of my patience here, and google isn’t being very helpful. Any ideas or thoughts you might have would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, Brian ryan April 2, 2015 at 3:29 am - Reply Brian, you just described my problem perfectly! Did you ever figure it out?

Brad Nicholas June 2, 2015 at 3:23 pm - Reply Hi @Derek Noticed there hasn’t been a clear answer posted yet regarding OS X Yosemite connection sharing with the BBB. Yosemite replaced natd and ipfw with a combined BSD utility called pf and it appears to have changed connection sharing behavior as a result. Yosemite’s Internet Sharing uses 192.188.2.0/24 by default, so even if you add the default route to 192.168.7.1 the connection sharing won’t work, and the behavior shown in Jason Kridner’s BBB OS X youtube video is different. What I’ve found to work is for an OS X Yosemite user is to either change the BBB’s IP to a 192.168.2.X address or modify their OS X connection sharing config using pfctl. more info and links on stackoverflow here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/30581692/4504428?stw=2 shankar June 5, 2015 at 10:38 am - Reply Hi Derek, I want to Accessing Internet from am335x based on custom board using USB Tethering of Android phone Not Working I wanted to access internet from am335xx custom board(Reference of beaglebone black), Use USB-tethering option of my smartphone and Using this option I wanted to explore for connecting to internet on board.On am335xx board have configure USB0(OTG) mini USB as master(HOST device) or slave device.

Paul Moggach June 9, 2016 at 5:48 pm - Reply I teach a course on the Raspberry Pi. With Raspian, all we have to do is change the cmdline.txt file and add something like ip=169.254.0.2 to set it to a fixed IP address. Then we plug it into a PC via any USB to Ethernet adapter. Now we can use any SSH, VNC, RDA connection to that address. Very simple, and with RDA on every windows computer in our college a pretty elegant solution to accessing the RPi anywhere. On the BBB side I have loaded up Debian 7.9 on the SD card but I am at a loss how to set up a similar environment to the RPi, and in the Debian world on the BBB I don’t even have the 192.168.7.2 access, which only seems to work with Angstrom. Angstrom is just not main-stream enough for my liking. So I’ll continue to work through the above to see if I can get things working in Debian, but any help would be appreciated.

As we later want to change the Linux Kernel itself we need to know how it is started by the BeagleBone. The AM335x processor on the BeagleBone Black has many configurable options where it can boot from which are all documented in Chapter 26 of the AM335x ARM® Cortex™-A8 Microprocessors Technical Reference Manual. The BeagleBone Black provides by alternative boot sequences which are selectable by the boot switch (S2). In default mode (S2 not pressed) it tries to boot from MMC1 (onboard eMMC), MMC0 (microSD), UART0, USB0. Usually it will find something in the onboard eMMC and boot from there. If S2 is pressed during power-up the boot sequence is changed to SPI0, MMC0 (microSD), UART0, USB0. As there is usually nothing bootable found on SPI0 it will boot from the microSD card. The onboard eMMC or an external microSD card have to be formatted in a special way for the AM335x processor to find its boot file, which is described very good on the MMC boot format wiki page at TI. If the AM335x processor finds a valid formatted MMC it searchings for a file named MLO on the first partition and if it is found it boots from that file. This is very U-Boot kicks in. U-Boot is a very versatile boot loader which can be used on the BeagleBone Black. U-Boot provides this MLO file as a second-stage boot-loader which then loads the actual U-Boot which has to be provided as a file named u-boot.bin in the same directory. U-Boot itself will then look for a file named uEnv.txt for further configuration and then act upon it. Formatting a microSD card Now as we have the theoretical background, let's try it our self. The following steps were all done on a (virtual) Ubuntu Linux system. Our microSD card is connected to /dev/sdb as has a size of 16 GB. The content of the SD card fill be deleted during this procedure. Instead of calculating the exact partitions sizes needed as explained by the MMC boot format wiki page we use a script which does everything for use. Download, make it executable and run it by wget http://dev.gentoo.org/~armin76/arm/beaglebone/mkcard.sh chmod +x mkcard.sh sudo ./mkcard.sh /dev/sdb Be sure to have /dev/sdb pointing to your microSD card and not anything else! In the output of the script you can see the partition table it created and in our case it was a primary FAT23 partition of 72261 blocks in size and a Linux ext4 partition of 15478627 blocks in size: 1024+0 records in 1024+0 records out 1048576 bytes (1.0 MB) copied, 0.447124 s, 2.3 MB/s Disk /dev/sdb doesn't contain a valid partition table DISK SIZE - 15931539456 bytes CYLINDERS - 1936 Checking that no-one is using this disk right now ... OK Disk /dev/sdb: 1936 cylinders, 255 heads, 63 sectors/track sfdisk: ERROR: sector 0 does not have an msdos signature /dev/sdb: unrecognized partition table type Old situation: No partitions found New situation: Units = cylinders of 8225280 bytes, blocks of 1024 bytes, counting from 0 Device Boot Start End #cyls #blocks Id System /dev/sdb1 * 0+ 8 9- 72261 c W95 FAT32 (LBA) /dev/sdb2 9 1935 1927 15478627+ 83 Linux /dev/sdb3 0 - 0 0 0 Empty /dev/sdb4 0 - 0 0 0 Empty Successfully wrote the new partition table Re-reading the partition table ... If you created or changed a DOS partition, /dev/foo7, say, then use dd(1) to zero the first 512 bytes: dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/foo7 bs=512 count=1 (See fdisk(8).) umount: /dev/sdb1: not mounted mkfs.fat 3.0.26 (2014-03-07) mkfs.fat: warning - lowercase labels might not work properly with DOS or Windows umount: /dev/sdb2: not mounted mke2fs 1.42.9 (4-Feb-2014) Filesystem label=rootfs OS type: Linux Block size=4096 (log=2) Fragment size=4096 (log=2) Stride=0 blocks, Stripe width=0 blocks 969136 inodes, 3869656 blocks 193482 blocks (5.00%) reserved for the super user First data block=0 Maximum filesystem blocks=3963617280 119 block groups 32768 blocks per group, 32768 fragments per group 8144 inodes per group Superblock backups stored on blocks: 32768, 98304, 163840, 229376, 294912, 819200, 884736, 1605632, 2654208 Allocating group tables: done Writing inode tables: done Creating journal (32768 blocks): done Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done Now you can mount the boot partition manually or replug the microSD card as most systems will mount it then automatically. Compiling U-Boot The next step is to compile U-Boot. As we need to cross compile this for the BeagleBone Black we need a suitable compiler. On Ubuntu this can be installed relatively easy by sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf Now we clone the git repository, create a default configuration and cross compile it for the BeagleBone Black by git clone git://git.denx.de/u-boot.git &amp;&amp; cd u-boot make am335x_boneblack_defconfig ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- make We should get a MLO and u-boot.bin file in the current directory and can copy those onto the boot partition of microSD card. Configuring U-Boot To configure U-Boot we create a file uEnv.txt on the boot partition and fill it, e.g. with console=ttyO0,115200n8 ipaddr=192.168.23.2 serverip=192.168.23.1 rootpath=/exports/rootfs netargs=setenv bootargs console=${console} ${optargs} root=/dev/nfs nfsroot=${serverip}:${rootpath},${nfsopts} rw ip=${ipaddr}:${serverip}:192.168.23.1:255.255.255.0:beaglebone:eth0:none:192.168.23.1 netboot=echo Booting from network ...; tftp ${loadaddr} ${bootfile}; tftp ${fdtaddr} ${fdtfile}; run netargs; bootz ${loadaddr} - ${fdtaddr} uenvcmd=run netboot to instruct U-Boot to get the Linux Kernel and device tree via TFTP. The details are depending on your configuration :). Booting ... Finally we can now boot from our microSD card. To see the actual boot process a RS232 cable like the TTL-232R-3V3 from FTDI is very handy. Just plug it to the J1 connector and open a serial terminal of your choice. Plug in the microSD card and hold down the S2 boot switch to force booting from the microSD card.

Always boot from microSD If you always want to boot from your microSD card you can invalidate the boot partition on the onboard eMMC. Then the AM335x processor will always fail back to the second boot option in the default order which is the microSD card. This can be done easily by booting your favourite Linux distro on the BeagleBone Black and issue an sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mmcblk1 bs=1024 count=1024 Be warned: This will wipe your boot partition on the eMMC!

If you want to disable booting from microSSD independent of the boot button or the content of the eMMC you have to alter the config pins.

Different from your suggestion, I have modified the uEnv.txt on the eMMC so that I can boot via network (NFS) or uSD (using invalid uboot command). My question is: once you boot via NFS or uSD, how can you mount and access the eMMC so that the uEnv.txt on eMMC is modified to boot from eMMC again? I know you can reflash the eMMC, but that will be an overkill and really time-consuming as I have to switch from eMMC and NFS booting often. Reply ↓ twam on February 5, 2015 at 17:58 said: You can mount the /dev/mmcblk1p1 partition to your preferred location and change the uEnv.txt file. Reply ↓ Samuel on February 22, 2015 at 18:27 said: Hi ! I'm currently struggling doing exactly that : how do you boot from eMMC if the NFS server (or the DHCP server) is down as a faisafe ? You spoke of invalid u-boot command ... ? thanks Reply ↓ twam on March 2, 2015 at 19:46 said: I didn't mention any invalid u-boot commands. I just said that the if you have a complete invalid boot section on the eMMC, the hardware built-in boot loader of the AM335x processor will fall back to its second boot option, which in that case is the SD card. Your plan might be possible using u-boot scripting, but I haven't tried this and I doubt that it's worth the effort. You want NFS boot usually for development and then you're pretty sure that your DHCP and NFS server is there. If not, fix it! 😉 If you're using your BeagleBone Black in some kind of production environment you usually want to boot from eMMC or micro SD. If have have to boot from NFS for some reason then you should make sure that it's always there. Having a fallback on microSD would net you also the keep your settings and everything in sync between NFS and microSD/eMMC root. Reply ↓ Thaj on February 15, 2015 at 19:44 said: Hey. Thanks Man. This is really helpful. I just have one doubt. There is MLO, u-boot.bin and uEnv.txt on eMMC already that comes by default with BBB. Can I just modify the uEnv.txt on eMMC to boot a kernel from microSD ? What i mean is can I just put the FS, Kernel zImage and dtb file on microSD and just modify the uEnv.txt in eMMC to point this kernel of microSD, Will that work?

I've in hand a BBB bought in december 2014. It works fine and boot from the Onboard eMMC (Debian 7). Recently, I've downloaded a new Debian ISO and flashed it on an external SD (Debian 8). If I insert the SD in the BBB, the board boots from the SD, and not on the eMMC as it should be or explained in yout article: 1. MMC1 (onboard eMMC), 2.MMC0 (microSD), 3.UART0, 4.USB0. I mention that i do not use the S2 switch. If I remove the SD, it boots from the eMMC. As you explained, it should boot by defaut from the eMMC, Did I miss Something ? Thanks. Reply ↓ twam on April 13, 2016 at 19:57 said: The BBB should load U-Boot from the eMMC, but the config file there could make U-Boot try to boot a Linux from your SD card.

With a SD card my BBB boots from eMMC, unless I press S2 (in which case it correctly boots from the SD card.) I'm trying to boot from the SD card without pressing S2, and without disturbing the eMMC partition (so that it can still boot from eMMC in case no SD card is inserted.) Can this be done by editing the (right now empty) file 'uEnv.txt' in the 'boot' directory of /dev/mmcblk0p1 ? mmcdev=0 bootpart=0:1 mmcroot=/dev/mmcblk0p1 ro ...but it's not working.

                   NS1:content=" Table of Contents Name pppd - Point-to-Point Protocol Daemon Synopsis pppd [ options ] Description PPP is the protocol used for establishing internet links over dial-up modems, DSL connections, and many other types of point-to-point links. The pppd daemon works together with the kernel PPP driver to establish and maintain a PPP link with another system (called the peer) and to negotiate Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for each end of the link. Pppd can also authenticate the peer and/or supply authentication information to the peer. PPP can be used with other network protocols besides IP, but such use is becoming increasingly rare. Frequently Used Options ttyname Use the serial port called ttyname to communicate with the peer. The string &quot;/dev/&quot; is prepended to ttyname to form the name of the device to open. If no device name is given, or if the name of the terminal connected to the standard input is given, pppd will use that terminal, and will not fork to put itself in the background. A value for this option from a privileged source cannot be overridden by a non-privileged user. speed An option that is a decimal number is taken as the desired baud rate for the serial device. On systems such as 4.4BSD and NetBSD, any speed can be specified. Other systems (e.g. Linux, SunOS) only support the commonly-used baud rates. asyncmap map This option sets the Async-Control-Character-Map (ACCM) for this end of the link. The ACCM is a set of 32 bits, one for each of the ASCII control characters with values from 0 to 31, where a 1 bit indicates that the corresponding control character should not be used in PPP packets sent to this system. The map is encoded as a hexadecimal number (without a leading 0x) where the least significant bit (00000001) represents character 0 and the most significant bit (80000000) represents character 31. Pppd will ask the peer to send these characters as a 2-byte escape sequence. If multiple asyncmap options are given, the values are ORed together. If no asyncmap option is given, the default is zero, so pppd will ask the peer not to escape any control characters. To escape transmitted characters, use the escape option. auth Require the peer to authenticate itself before allowing network packets to be sent or received. This option is the default if the system has a default route. If neither this option nor the noauth option is specified, pppd will only allow the peer to use IP addresses to which the system does not already have a route. call name Read additional options from the file /etc/ppp/peers/name. This file may contain privileged options, such as noauth, even if pppd is not being run by root. The name string may not begin with / or include .. as a pathname component. The format of the options file is described below. connect script Usually there is something which needs to be done to prepare the link before the PPP protocol can be started; for instance, with a dial-up modem, commands need to be sent to the modem to dial the appropriate phone number. This option specifies an command for pppd to execute (by passing it to a shell) before attempting to start PPP negotiation. The chat (8) program is often useful here, as it provides a way to send arbitrary strings to a modem and respond to received characters. A value for this option from a privileged source cannot be overridden by a non-privileged user. crtscts Specifies that pppd should set the serial port to use hardware flow control using the RTS and CTS signals in the RS-232 interface. If neither the crtscts, the nocrtscts, the cdtrcts nor the nocdtrcts option is given, the hardware flow control setting for the serial port is left unchanged. Some serial ports (such as Macintosh serial ports) lack a true RTS output. Such serial ports use this mode to implement unidirectional flow control. The serial port will suspend transmission when requested by the modem (via CTS) but will be unable to request the modem to stop sending to the computer. This mode retains the ability to use DTR as a modem control line. defaultroute Add a default route to the system routing tables, using the peer as the gateway, when IPCP negotiation is successfully completed. This entry is removed when the PPP connection is broken. This option is privileged if the nodefaultroute option has been specified. disconnect script Execute the command specified by script, by passing it to a shell, after pppd has terminated the link. This command could, for example, issue commands to the modem to cause it to hang up if hardware modem control signals were not available. The disconnect script is not run if the modem has already hung up. A value for this option from a privileged source cannot be overridden by a non-privileged user. escape xx,yy,... Specifies that certain characters should be escaped on transmission (regardless of whether the peer requests them to be escaped with its async control character map). The characters to be escaped are specified as a list of hex numbers separated by commas. Note that almost any character can be specified for the escape option, unlike the asyncmap option which only allows control characters to be specified. The characters which may not be escaped are those with hex values 0x20 - 0x3f or 0x5e. file name Read options from file name (the format is described below). The file must be readable by the user who has invoked pppd. init script Execute the command specified by script, by passing it to a shell, to initialize the serial line. This script would typically use the chat(8) program to configure the modem to enable auto answer. A value for this option from a privileged source cannot be overridden by a non-privileged user. lock Specifies that pppd should create a UUCP-style lock file for the serial device to ensure exclusive access to the device. mru n Set the MRU [Maximum Receive Unit] value to n. Pppd will ask the peer to send packets of no more than n bytes. The value of n must be between 128 and 16384; the default is 1500. A value of 296 works well on very slow links (40 bytes for TCP/IP header + 256 bytes of data). Note that for the IPv6 protocol, the MRU must be at least 1280. mtu n Set the MTU [Maximum Transmit Unit] value to n. Unless the peer requests a smaller value via MRU negotiation, pppd will request that the kernel networking code send data packets of no more than n bytes through the PPP network interface. Note that for the IPv6 protocol, the MTU must be at least 1280. passive Enables the &quot;passive&quot; option in the LCP. With this option, pppd will attempt to initiate a connection; if no reply is received from the peer, pppd will then just wait passively for a valid LCP packet from the peer, instead of exiting, as it would without this option. Options &lt;local_IP_address&gt;:&lt;remote_IP_address&gt; Set the local and/or remote interface IP addresses. Either one may be omitted. The IP addresses can be specified with a host name or in decimal dot notation (e.g. 150.234.56.78). The default local address is the (first) IP address of the system (unless the noipdefault option is given). The remote address will be obtained from the peer if not specified in any option. Thus, in simple cases, this option is not required. If a local and/or remote IP address is specified with this option, pppd will not accept a different value from the peer in the IPCP negotiation, unless the ipcp-accept-local and/or ipcp-accept-remote options are given, respectively. ipv6 &lt;local_interface_identifier&gt;,&lt;remote_interface_identifier&gt; Set the local and/or remote 64-bit interface identifier. Either one may be omitted. The identifier must be specified in standard ascii notation of IPv6 addresses (e.g. ::dead:beef). If the ipv6cp-use-ipaddr option is given, the local identifier is the local IPv4 address (see above). On systems which supports a unique persistent id, such as EUI-48 derived from the Ethernet MAC address, ipv6cp-use-persistent option can be used to replace the ipv6 &lt;local&gt;,&lt;remote&gt; option. Otherwise the identifier is randomized. active-filter filter-expression Specifies a packet filter to be applied to data packets to determine which packets are to be regarded as link activity, and therefore reset the idle timer, or cause the link to be brought up in demand-dialling mode. This option is useful in conjunction with the idle option if there are packets being sent or received regularly over the link (for example, routing information packets) which would otherwise prevent the link from ever appearing to be idle. The filter-expression syntax is as described for tcpdump(1) , except that qualifiers which are inappropriate for a PPP link, such as ether and arp, are not permitted. Generally the filter expression should be enclosed in single-quotes to prevent whitespace in the expression from being interpreted by the shell. This option is currently only available under Linux, and requires that the kernel was configured to include PPP filtering support (CONFIG_PPP_FILTER). Note that it is possible to apply different constraints to incoming and outgoing packets using the inbound and outbound qualifiers. allow-ip address(es) Allow peers to use the given IP address or subnet without authenticating themselves. The parameter is parsed as for each element of the list of allowed IP addresses in the secrets files (see the AUTHENTICATION section below). allow-number number Allow peers to connect from the given telephone number. A trailing `*' character will match all numbers beginning with the leading part. bsdcomp nr,nt Request that the peer compress packets that it sends, using the BSD-Compress scheme, with a maximum code size of nr bits, and agree to compress packets sent to the peer with a maximum code size of nt bits. If nt is not specified, it defaults to the value given for nr. Values in the range 9 to 15 may be used for nr and nt; larger values give better compression but consume more kernel memory for compression dictionaries. Alternatively, a value of 0 for nr or nt disables compression in the corresponding direction. Use nobsdcomp or bsdcomp 0 to disable BSD-Compress compression entirely. cdtrcts Use a non-standard hardware flow control (i.e. DTR/CTS) to control the flow of data on the serial port. If neither the crtscts, the nocrtscts, the cdtrcts nor the nocdtrcts option is given, the hardware flow control setting for the serial port is left unchanged. Some serial ports (such as Macintosh serial ports) lack a true RTS output. Such serial ports use this mode to implement true bi-directional flow control. The sacrifice is that this flow control mode does not permit using DTR as a modem control line. chap-interval n If this option is given, pppd will rechallenge the peer every n seconds. chap-max-challenge n Set the maximum number of CHAP challenge transmissions to n (default 10). chap-restart n Set the CHAP restart interval (retransmission timeout for challenges) to n seconds (default 3). child-timeout n When exiting, wait for up to n seconds for any child processes (such as the command specified with the pty command) to exit before exiting. At the end of the timeout, pppd will send a SIGTERM signal to any remaining child processes and exit. A value of 0 means no timeout, that is, pppd will wait until all child processes have exited. connect-delay n Wait for up to n milliseconds after the connect script finishes for a valid PPP packet from the peer. At the end of this time, or when a valid PPP packet is received from the peer, pppd will commence negotiation by sending its first LCP packet. The default value is 1000 (1 second). This wait period only applies if the connect or pty option is used. debug Enables connection debugging facilities. If this option is given, pppd will log the contents of all control packets sent or received in a readable form. The packets are logged through syslog with facility daemon and level debug. This information can be directed to a file by setting up /etc/syslog.conf appropriately (see syslog.conf(5) ). default-asyncmap Disable asyncmap negotiation, forcing all control characters to be escaped for both the transmit and the receive direction. default-mru Disable MRU [Maximum Receive Unit] negotiation. With this option, pppd will use the default MRU value of 1500 bytes for both the transmit and receive direction. deflate nr,nt Request that the peer compress packets that it sends, using the Deflate scheme, with a maximum window size of 2**nr bytes, and agree to compress packets sent to the peer with a maximum window size of 2**nt bytes. If nt is not specified, it defaults to the value given for nr. Values in the range 9 to 15 may be used for nr and nt; larger values give better compression but consume more kernel memory for compression dictionaries. Alternatively, a value of 0 for nr or nt disables compression in the corresponding direction. Use nodeflate or deflate 0 to disable Deflate compression entirely. (Note: pppd requests Deflate compression in preference to BSD-Compress if the peer can do either.) demand Initiate the link only on demand, i.e. when data traffic is present. With this option, the remote IP address must be specified by the user on the command line or in an options file. Pppd will initially configure the interface and enable it for IP traffic without connecting to the peer. When traffic is available, pppd will connect to the peer and perform negotiation, authentication, etc. When this is completed, pppd will commence passing data packets (i.e., IP packets) across the link. The demand option implies the persist option. If this behaviour is not desired, use the nopersist option after the demand option. The idle and holdoff options are also useful in conjuction with the demand option. domain d Append the domain name d to the local host name for authentication purposes. For example, if gethostname() returns the name porsche, but the fully qualified domain name is porsche.Quotron.COM, you could specify domain Quotron.COM. Pppd would then use the name porsche.Quotron.COM for looking up secrets in the secrets file, and as the default name to send to the peer when authenticating itself to the peer. This option is privileged. dryrun With the dryrun option, pppd will print out all the option values which have been set and then exit, after parsing the command line and options files and checking the option values, but before initiating the link. The option values are logged at level info, and also printed to standard output unless the device on standard output is the device that pppd would be using to communicate with the peer. dump With the dump option, pppd will print out all the option values which have been set. This option is like the dryrun option except that pppd proceeds as normal rather than exiting. endpoint &lt;epdisc&gt; Sets the endpoint discriminator sent by the local machine to the peer during multilink negotiation to &lt;epdisc&gt;. The default is to use the MAC address of the first ethernet interface on the system, if any, otherwise the IPv4 address corresponding to the hostname, if any, provided it is not in the multicast or locally-assigned IP address ranges, or the localhost address. The endpoint discriminator can be the string null or of the form type:value, where type is a decimal number or one of the strings local, IP, MAC, magic, or phone. The value is an IP address in dotted-decimal notation for the IP type, or a string of bytes in hexadecimal, separated by periods or colons for the other types. For the MAC type, the value may also be the name of an ethernet or similar network interface. This option is currently only available under Linux. eap-interval n If this option is given and pppd authenticates the peer with EAP (i.e., is the server), pppd will restart EAP authentication every n seconds. For EAP SRP-SHA1, see also the srp-interval option, which enables lightweight rechallenge. eap-max-rreq n Set the maximum number of EAP Requests to which pppd will respond (as a client) without hearing EAP Success or Failure. (Default is 20.) eap-max-sreq n Set the maximum number of EAP Requests that pppd will issue (as a server) while attempting authentication. (Default is 10.) eap-restart n Set the retransmit timeout for EAP Requests when acting as a server (authenticator). (Default is 3 seconds.) eap-timeout n Set the maximum time to wait for the peer to send an EAP Request when acting as a client (authenticatee). (Default is 20 seconds.) hide-password When logging the contents of PAP packets, this option causes pppd to exclude the password string from the log. This is the default. holdoff n Specifies how many seconds to wait before re-initiating the link after it terminates. This option only has any effect if the persist or demand option is used. The holdoff period is not applied if the link was terminated because it was idle. idle n Specifies that pppd should disconnect if the link is idle for n seconds. The link is idle when no data packets (i.e. IP packets) are being sent or received. Note: it is not advisable to use this option with the persist option without the demand option. If the active-filter option is given, data packets which are rejected by the specified activity filter also count as the link being idle. ipcp-accept-local With this option, pppd will accept the peer's idea of our local IP address, even if the local IP address was specified in an option. ipcp-accept-remote With this option, pppd will accept the peer's idea of its (remote) IP address, even if the remote IP address was specified in an option. ipcp-max-configure n Set the maximum number of IPCP configure-request transmissions to n (default 10). ipcp-max-failure n Set the maximum number of IPCP configure-NAKs returned before starting to send configure-Rejects instead to n (default 10). ipcp-max-terminate n Set the maximum number of IPCP terminate-request transmissions to n (default 3). ipcp-restart n Set the IPCP restart interval (retransmission timeout) to n seconds (default 3). ipparam string Provides an extra parameter to the ip-up and ip-down scripts. If this option is given, the string supplied is given as the 6th parameter to those scripts. ipv6cp-max-configure n Set the maximum number of IPv6CP configure-request transmissions to n (default 10). ipv6cp-max-failure n Set the maximum number of IPv6CP configure-NAKs returned before starting to send configure-Rejects instead to n (default 10). ipv6cp-max-terminate n Set the maximum number of IPv6CP terminate-request transmissions to n (default 3). ipv6cp-restart n Set the IPv6CP restart interval (retransmission timeout) to n seconds (default 3). ipx Enable the IPXCP and IPX protocols. This option is presently only supported under Linux, and only if your kernel has been configured to include IPX support. ipx-network n Set the IPX network number in the IPXCP configure request frame to n, a hexadecimal number (without a leading 0x). There is no valid default. If this option is not specified, the network number is obtained from the peer. If the peer does not have the network number, the IPX protocol will not be started. ipx-node n:m Set the IPX node numbers. The two node numbers are separated from each other with a colon character. The first number n is the local node number. The second number m is the peer's node number. Each node number is a hexadecimal number, at most 10 digits long. The node numbers on the ipx-network must be unique. There is no valid default. If this option is not specified then the node numbers are obtained from the peer. ipx-router-name &lt;string&gt; Set the name of the router. This is a string and is sent to the peer as information data. ipx-routing n Set the routing protocol to be received by this option. More than one instance of ipx-routing may be specified. The 'none' option (0) may be specified as the only instance of ipx-routing. The values may be 0 for NONE, 2 for RIP/SAP, and 4 for NLSP. ipxcp-accept-local Accept the peer's NAK for the node number specified in the ipx-node option. If a node number was specified, and non-zero, the default is to insist that the value be used. If you include this option then you will permit the peer to override the entry of the node number. ipxcp-accept-network Accept the peer's NAK for the network number specified in the ipx-network option. If a network number was specified, and non-zero, the default is to insist that the value be used. If you include this option then you will permit the peer to override the entry of the node number. ipxcp-accept-remote Use the peer's network number specified in the configure request frame. If a node number was specified for the peer and this option was not specified, the peer will be forced to use the value which you have specified. ipxcp-max-configure n Set the maximum number of IPXCP configure request frames which the system will send to n. The default is 10. ipxcp-max-failure n Set the maximum number of IPXCP NAK frames which the local system will send before it rejects the options. The default value is 3. ipxcp-max-terminate n Set the maximum nuber of IPXCP terminate request frames before the local system considers that the peer is not listening to them. The default value is 3. kdebug n Enable debugging code in the kernel-level PPP driver. The argument values depend on the specific kernel driver, but in general a value of 1 will enable general kernel debug messages. (Note that these messages are usually only useful for debugging the kernel driver itself.) For the Linux 2.2.x kernel driver, the value is a sum of bits: 1 to enable general debug messages, 2 to request that the contents of received packets be printed, and 4 to request that the contents of transmitted packets be printed. On most systems, messages printed by the kernel are logged by syslog(1) to a file as directed in the /etc/syslog.conf configuration file. ktune Enables pppd to alter kernel settings as appropriate. Under Linux, pppd will enable IP forwarding (i.e. set /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward to 1) if the proxyarp option is used, and will enable the dynamic IP address option (i.e. set /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_dynaddr to 1) in demand mode if the local address changes. lcp-echo-failure n If this option is given, pppd will presume the peer to be dead if n LCP echo-requests are sent without receiving a valid LCP echo-reply. If this happens, pppd will terminate the connection. Use of this option requires a non-zero value for the lcp-echo-interval parameter. This option can be used to enable pppd to terminate after the physical connection has been broken (e.g., the modem has hung up) in situations where no hardware modem control lines are available. lcp-echo-interval n If this option is given, pppd will send an LCP echo-request frame to the peer every n seconds. Normally the peer should respond to the echo-request by sending an echo-reply. This option can be used with the lcp-echo-failure option to detect that the peer is no longer connected. lcp-max-configure n Set the maximum number of LCP configure-request transmissions to n (default 10). lcp-max-failure n Set the maximum number of LCP configure-NAKs returned before starting to send configure-Rejects instead to n (default 10). lcp-max-terminate n Set the maximum number of LCP terminate-request transmissions to n (default 3). lcp-restart n Set the LCP restart interval (retransmission timeout) to n seconds (default 3). linkname name Sets the logical name of the link to name. Pppd will create a file named ppp-name.pid in /var/run (or /etc/ppp on some systems) containing its process ID. This can be useful in determining which instance of pppd is responsible for the link to a given peer system. This is a privileged option. local Don't use the modem control lines. With this option, pppd will ignore the state of the CD (Carrier Detect) signal from the modem and will not change the state of the DTR (Data Terminal Ready) signal. logfd n Send log messages to file descriptor n. Pppd will send log messages to at most one file or file descriptor (as well as sending the log messages to syslog), so this option and the logfile option are mutually exclusive. The default is for pppd to send log messages to stdout (file descriptor 1), unless the serial port is already open on stdout. logfile filename Append log messages to the file filename (as well as sending the log messages to syslog). The file is opened with the privileges of the user who invoked pppd, in append mode. login Use the system password database for authenticating the peer using PAP, and record the user in the system wtmp file. Note that the peer must have an entry in the /etc/ppp/pap-secrets file as well as the system password database to be allowed access. maxconnect n Terminate the connection when it has been available for network traffic for n seconds (i.e. n seconds after the first network control protocol comes up). maxfail n Terminate after n consecutive failed connection attempts. A value of 0 means no limit. The default value is 10. modem Use the modem control lines. This option is the default. With this option, pppd will wait for the CD (Carrier Detect) signal from the modem to be asserted when opening the serial device (unless a connect script is specified), and it will drop the DTR (Data Terminal Ready) signal briefly when the connection is terminated and before executing the connect script. On Ultrix, this option implies hardware flow control, as for the crtscts option. mp Enables the use of PPP multilink; this is an alias for the `multilink' option. This option is currently only available under Linux. mppe-stateful Allow MPPE to use stateful mode. Stateless mode is still attempted first. The default is to disallow stateful mode. mpshortseq Enables the use of short (12-bit) sequence numbers in multilink headers, as opposed to 24-bit sequence numbers. This option is only available under Linux, and only has any effect if multilink is enabled (see the multilink option). mrru n Sets the Maximum Reconstructed Receive Unit to n. The MRRU is the maximum size for a received packet on a multilink bundle, and is analogous to the MRU for the individual links. This option is currently only available under Linux, and only has any effect if multilink is enabled (see the multilink option). ms-dns &lt;addr&gt; If pppd is acting as a server for Microsoft Windows clients, this option allows pppd to supply one or two DNS (Domain Name Server) addresses to the clients. The first instance of this option specifies the primary DNS address; the second instance (if given) specifies the secondary DNS address. (This option was present in some older versions of pppd under the name dns-addr.) ms-wins &lt;addr&gt; If pppd is acting as a server for Microsoft Windows or &quot;Samba&quot; clients, this option allows pppd to supply one or two WINS (Windows Internet Name Services) server addresses to the clients. The first instance of this option specifies the primary WINS address; the second instance (if given) specifies the secondary WINS address. multilink Enables the use of the PPP multilink protocol. If the peer also supports multilink, then this link can become part of a bundle between the local system and the peer. If there is an existing bundle to the peer, pppd will join this link to that bundle, otherwise pppd will create a new bundle. See the MULTILINK section below. This option is currently only available under Linux. name name Set the name of the local system for authentication purposes to name. This is a privileged option. With this option, pppd will use lines in the secrets files which have name as the second field when looking for a secret to use in authenticating the peer. In addition, unless overridden with the user option, name will be used as the name to send to the peer when authenticating the local system to the peer. (Note that pppd does not append the domain name to name.) noaccomp Disable Address/Control compression in both directions (send and receive). noauth Do not require the peer to authenticate itself. This option is privileged. nobsdcomp Disables BSD-Compress compression; pppd will not request or agree to compress packets using the BSD-Compress scheme. noccp Disable CCP (Compression Control Protocol) negotiation. This option should only be required if the peer is buggy and gets confused by requests from pppd for CCP negotiation. nocrtscts Disable hardware flow control (i.e. RTS/CTS) on the serial port. If neither the crtscts nor the nocrtscts nor the cdtrcts nor the nocdtrcts option is given, the hardware flow control setting for the serial port is left unchanged. nocdtrcts This option is a synonym for nocrtscts. Either of these options will disable both forms of hardware flow control. nodefaultroute Disable the defaultroute option. The system administrator who wishes to prevent users from creating default routes with pppd can do so by placing this option in the /etc/ppp/options file. nodeflate Disables Deflate compression; pppd will not request or agree to compress packets using the Deflate scheme. nodetach Don't detach from the controlling terminal. Without this option, if a serial device other than the terminal on the standard input is specified, pppd will fork to become a background process. noendpoint Disables pppd from sending an endpoint discriminator to the peer or accepting one from the peer (see the MULTILINK section below). This option should only be required if the peer is buggy. noip Disable IPCP negotiation and IP communication. This option should only be required if the peer is buggy and gets confused by requests from pppd for IPCP negotiation. noipv6 Disable IPv6CP negotiation and IPv6 communication. This option should only be required if the peer is buggy and gets confused by requests from pppd for IPv6CP negotiation. noipdefault Disables the default behaviour when no local IP address is specified, which is to determine (if possible) the local IP address from the hostname. With this option, the peer will have to supply the local IP address during IPCP negotiation (unless it specified explicitly on the command line or in an options file). noipx Disable the IPXCP and IPX protocols. This option should only be required if the peer is buggy and gets confused by requests from pppd for IPXCP negotiation. noktune Opposite of the ktune option; disables pppd from changing system settings. nolog Do not send log messages to a file or file descriptor. This option cancels the logfd and logfile options. nomagic Disable magic number negotiation. With this option, pppd cannot detect a looped-back line. This option should only be needed if the peer is buggy. nomp Disables the use of PPP multilink. This option is currently only available under Linux. nomppe Disables MPPE (Microsoft Point to Point Encryption). This is the default. nomppe-40 Disable 40-bit encryption with MPPE. nomppe-128 Disable 128-bit encryption with MPPE. nomppe-stateful Disable MPPE stateful mode. This is the default. nompshortseq Disables the use of short (12-bit) sequence numbers in the PPP multilink protocol, forcing the use of 24-bit sequence numbers. This option is currently only available under Linux, and only has any effect if multilink is enabled. nomultilink Disables the use of PPP multilink. This option is currently only available under Linux. nopcomp Disable protocol field compression negotiation in both the receive and the transmit direction. nopersist Exit once a connection has been made and terminated. This is the default unless the persist or demand option has been specified. nopredictor1 Do not accept or agree to Predictor-1 compression. noproxyarp Disable the proxyarp option. The system administrator who wishes to prevent users from creating proxy ARP entries with pppd can do so by placing this option in the /etc/ppp/options file. notty Normally, pppd requires a terminal device. With this option, pppd will allocate itself a pseudo-tty master/slave pair and use the slave as its terminal device. Pppd will create a child process to act as a `character shunt' to transfer characters between the pseudo-tty master and its standard input and output. Thus pppd will transmit characters on its standard output and receive characters on its standard input even if they are not terminal devices. This option increases the latency and CPU overhead of transferring data over the ppp interface as all of the characters sent and received must flow through the character shunt process. An explicit device name may not be given if this option is used. novj Disable Van Jacobson style TCP/IP header compression in both the transmit and the receive direction. novjccomp Disable the connection-ID compression option in Van Jacobson style TCP/IP header compression. With this option, pppd will not omit the connection-ID byte from Van Jacobson compressed TCP/IP headers, nor ask the peer to do so. papcrypt Indicates that all secrets in the /etc/ppp/pap-secrets file which are used for checking the identity of the peer are encrypted, and thus pppd should not accept a password which, before encryption, is identical to the secret from the /etc/ppp/pap-secrets file. pap-max-authreq n Set the maximum number of PAP authenticate-request transmissions to n (default 10). pap-restart n Set the PAP restart interval (retransmission timeout) to n seconds (default 3). pap-timeout n Set the maximum time that pppd will wait for the peer to authenticate itself with PAP to n seconds (0 means no limit). pass-filter filter-expression Specifies a packet filter to applied to data packets being sent or received to determine which packets should be allowed to pass. Packets which are rejected by the filter are silently discarded. This option can be used to prevent specific network daemons (such as routed) using up link bandwidth, or to provide a very basic firewall capability. The filter-expression syntax is as described for tcpdump(1) , except that qualifiers which are inappropriate for a PPP link, such as ether and arp, are not permitted. Generally the filter expression should be enclosed in single-quotes to prevent whitespace in the expression from being interpreted by the shell. Note that it is possible to apply different constraints to incoming and outgoing packets using the inbound and outbound qualifiers. This option is currently only available under Linux, and requires that the kernel was configured to include PPP filtering support (CONFIG_PPP_FILTER). password password-string Specifies the password to use for authenticating to the peer. Use of this option is discouraged, as the password is likely to be visible to other users on the system (for example, by using ps(1) ). persist Do not exit after a connection is terminated; instead try to reopen the connection. The maxfail option still has an effect on persistent connections. plugin filename Load the shared library object file filename as a plugin. This is a privileged option. If filename does not contain a slash (/), pppd will look in the /usr/lib/pppd/version directory for the plugin, where version is the version number of pppd (for example, 2.4.2). predictor1 Request that the peer compress frames that it sends using Predictor-1 compression, and agree to compress transmitted frames with Predictor-1 if requested. This option has no effect unless the kernel driver supports Predictor-1 compression. privgroup group-name Allows members of group group-name to use privileged options. This is a privileged option. Use of this option requires care as there is no guarantee that members of group-name cannot use pppd to become root themselves. Consider it equivalent to putting the members of group-name in the kmem or disk group. proxyarp Add an entry to this system's ARP [Address Resolution Protocol] table with the IP address of the peer and the Ethernet address of this system. This will have the effect of making the peer appear to other systems to be on the local ethernet. pty script Specifies that the command script is to be used to communicate rather than a specific terminal device. Pppd will allocate itself a pseudo-tty master/slave pair and use the slave as its terminal device. The script will be run in a child process with the pseudo-tty master as its standard input and output. An explicit device name may not be given if this option is used. (Note: if the record option is used in conjuction with the pty option, the child process will have pipes on its standard input and output.) receive-all With this option, pppd will accept all control characters from the peer, including those marked in the receive asyncmap. Without this option, pppd will discard those characters as specified in RFC1662. This option should only be needed if the peer is buggy. record filename Specifies that pppd should record all characters sent and received to a file named filename. This file is opened in append mode, using the user's user-ID and permissions. This option is implemented using a pseudo-tty and a process to transfer characters between the pseudo-tty and the real serial device, so it will increase the latency and CPU overhead of transferring data over the ppp interface. The characters are stored in a tagged format with timestamps, which can be displayed in readable form using the pppdump(8) program. remotename name Set the assumed name of the remote system for authentication purposes to name. remotenumber number Set the assumed telephone number of the remote system for authentication purposes to number. refuse-chap With this option, pppd will not agree to authenticate itself to the peer using CHAP. refuse-mschap With this option, pppd will not agree to authenticate itself to the peer using MS-CHAP. refuse-mschap-v2 With this option, pppd will not agree to authenticate itself to the peer using MS-CHAPv2. refuse-eap With this option, pppd will not agree to authenticate itself to the peer using EAP. refuse-pap With this option, pppd will not agree to authenticate itself to the peer using PAP. require-chap Require the peer to authenticate itself using CHAP [Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol] authentication. require-mppe Require the use of MPPE (Microsoft Point to Point Encryption). This option disables all other compression types. This option enables both 40-bit and 128-bit encryption. In order for MPPE to successfully come up, you must have authenticated with either MS-CHAP or MS-CHAPv2. This option is presently only supported under Linux, and only if your kernel has been configured to include MPPE support. require-mppe-40 Require the use of MPPE, with 40-bit encryption. require-mppe-128 Require the use of MPPE, with 128-bit encryption. require-mschap Require the peer to authenticate itself using MS-CHAP [Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol] authentication. require-mschap-v2 Require the peer to authenticate itself using MS-CHAPv2 [Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol, Version 2] authentication. require-eap Require the peer to authenticate itself using EAP [Extensible Authentication Protocol] authentication. require-pap Require the peer to authenticate itself using PAP [Password Authentication Protocol] authentication. show-password When logging the contents of PAP packets, this option causes pppd to show the password string in the log message. silent With this option, pppd will not transmit LCP packets to initiate a connection until a valid LCP packet is received from the peer (as for the `passive' option with ancient versions of pppd). srp-interval n If this parameter is given and pppd uses EAP SRP-SHA1 to authenticate the peer (i.e., is the server), then pppd will use the optional lightweight SRP rechallenge mechanism at intervals of n seconds. This option is faster than eap-interval reauthentication because it uses a hash-based mechanism and does not derive a new session key. srp-pn-secret string Set the long-term pseudonym-generating secret for the server. This value is optional and if set, needs to be known at the server (authenticator) side only, and should be different for each server (or poll of identical servers). It is used along with the current date to generate a key to encrypt and decrypt the client's identity contained in the pseudonym. srp-use-pseudonym When operating as an EAP SRP-SHA1 client, attempt to use the pseudonym stored in ~/.ppp_psuedonym first as the identity, and save in this file any pseudonym offered by the peer during authentication. sync Use synchronous HDLC serial encoding instead of asynchronous. The device used by pppd with this option must have sync support. Currently supports Microgate SyncLink adapters under Linux and FreeBSD 2.2.8 and later. unit num Sets the ppp unit number (for a ppp0 or ppp1 etc interface name) for outbound connections. updetach With this option, pppd will detach from its controlling terminal once it has successfully established the ppp connection (to the point where the first network control protocol, usually the IP control protocol, has come up). usehostname Enforce the use of the hostname (with domain name appended, if given) as the name of the local system for authentication purposes (overrides the name option). This option is not normally needed since the name option is privileged. usepeerdns Ask the peer for up to 2 DNS server addresses. The addresses supplied by the peer (if any) are passed to the /etc/ppp/ip-up script in the environment variables DNS1 and DNS2, and the environment variable USEPEERDNS will be set to 1. In addition, pppd will create an /etc/ppp/resolv.conf file containing one or two nameserver lines with the address(es) supplied by the peer. user name Sets the name used for authenticating the local system to the peer to name. vj-max-slots n Sets the number of connection slots to be used by the Van Jacobson TCP/IP header compression and decompression code to n, which must be between 2 and 16 (inclusive). welcome script Run the executable or shell command specified by script before initiating PPP negotiation, after the connect script (if any) has completed. A value for this option from a privileged source cannot be overridden by a non-privileged user. xonxoff Use software flow control (i.e. XON/XOFF) to control the flow of data on the serial port. Options Files Options can be taken from files as well as the command line. Pppd reads options from the files /etc/ppp/options, ~/.ppprc and /etc/ppp/options.ttyname (in that order) before processing the options on the command line. (In fact, the command-line options are scanned to find the terminal name before the options.ttyname file is read.) In forming the name of the options.ttyname file, the initial /dev/ is removed from the terminal name, and any remaining / characters are replaced with dots. An options file is parsed into a series of words, delimited by whitespace. Whitespace can be included in a word by enclosing the word in double-quotes (&quot;). A backslash (\) quotes the following character. A hash (#) starts a comment, which continues until the end of the line. There is no restriction on using the file or call options within an options file. Security pppd provides system administrators with sufficient access control that PPP access to a server machine can be provided to legitimate users without fear of compromising the security of the server or the network it's on. This control is provided through restrictions on which IP addresses the peer may use, based on its authenticated identity (if any), and through restrictions on which options a non-privileged user may use. Several of pppd's options are privileged, in particular those which permit potentially insecure configurations; these options are only accepted in files which are under the control of the system administrator, or if pppd is being run by root. The default behaviour of pppd is to allow an unauthenticated peer to use a given IP address only if the system does not already have a route to that IP address. For example, a system with a permanent connection to the wider internet will normally have a default route, and thus all peers will have to authenticate themselves in order to set up a connection. On such a system, the auth option is the default. On the other hand, a system where the PPP link is the only connection to the internet will not normally have a default route, so the peer will be able to use almost any IP address without authenticating itself. As indicated above, some security-sensitive options are privileged, which means that they may not be used by an ordinary non-privileged user running a setuid-root pppd, either on the command line, in the user's ~/.ppprc file, or in an options file read using the file option. Privileged options may be used in /etc/ppp/options file or in an options file read using the call option. If pppd is being run by the root user, privileged options can be used without restriction. When opening the device, pppd uses either the invoking user's user ID or the root UID (that is, 0), depending on whether the device name was specified by the user or the system administrator. If the device name comes from a privileged source, that is, /etc/ppp/options or an options file read using the call option, pppd uses full root privileges when opening the device. Thus, by creating an appropriate file under /etc/ppp/peers, the system administrator can allow users to establish a ppp connection via a device which they would not normally have permission to access. Otherwise pppd uses the invoking user's real UID when opening the device. Authentication Authentication is the process whereby one peer convinces the other of its identity. This involves the first peer sending its name to the other, together with some kind of secret information which could only come from the genuine authorized user of that name. In such an exchange, we will call the first peer the &quot;client&quot; and the other the &quot;server&quot;. The client has a name by which it identifies itself to the server, and the server also has a name by which it identifies itself to the client. Generally the genuine client shares some secret (or password) with the server, and authenticates itself by proving that it knows that secret. Very often, the names used for authentication correspond to the internet hostnames of the peers, but this is not essential. At present, pppd supports three authentication protocols: the Password Authentication Protocol (PAP), Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP), and Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). PAP involves the client sending its name and a cleartext password to the server to authenticate itself. In contrast, the server initiates the CHAP authentication exchange by sending a challenge to the client (the challenge packet includes the server's name). The client must respond with a response which includes its name plus a hash value derived from the shared secret and the challenge, in order to prove that it knows the secret. EAP supports CHAP-style authentication, and also includes the SRP-SHA1 mechanism, which is resistant to dictionary-based attacks and does not require a cleartext password on the server side. The PPP protocol, being symmetrical, allows both peers to require the other to authenticate itself. In that case, two separate and independent authentication exchanges will occur. The two exchanges could use different authentication protocols, and in principle, different names could be used in the two exchanges. The default behaviour of pppd is to agree to authenticate if requested, and to not require authentication from the peer. However, pppd will not agree to authenticate itself with a particular protocol if it has no secrets which could be used to do so. Pppd stores secrets for use in authentication in secrets files (/etc/ppp/pap-secrets for PAP, /etc/ppp/chap-secrets for CHAP, MS-CHAP, MS-CHAPv2, and EAP MD5-Challenge, and /etc/ppp/srp-secrets for EAP SRP-SHA1). All secrets files have the same format. The secrets files can contain secrets for pppd to use in authenticating itself to other systems, as well as secrets for pppd to use when authenticating other systems to itself. Each line in a secrets file contains one secret. A given secret is specific to a particular combination of client and server - it can only be used by that client to authenticate itself to that server. Thus each line in a secrets file has at least 3 fields: the name of the client, the name of the server, and the secret. These fields may be followed by a list of the IP addresses that the specified client may use when connecting to the specified server. A secrets file is parsed into words as for a options file, so the client name, server name and secrets fields must each be one word, with any embedded spaces or other special characters quoted or escaped. Note that case is significant in the client and server names and in the secret. If the secret starts with an `@', what follows is assumed to be the name of a file from which to read the secret. A &quot;*&quot; as the client or server name matches any name. When selecting a secret, pppd takes the best match, i.e. the match with the fewest wildcards. Any following words on the same line are taken to be a list of acceptable IP addresses for that client. If there are only 3 words on the line, or if the first word is &quot;-&quot;, then all IP addresses are disallowed. To allow any address, use &quot;*&quot;. A word starting with &quot;!&quot; indicates that the specified address is not acceptable. An address may be followed by &quot;/&quot; and a number n, to indicate a whole subnet, i.e. all addresses which have the same value in the most significant n bits. In this form, the address may be followed by a plus sign (&quot;+&quot;) to indicate that one address from the subnet is authorized, based on the ppp network interface unit number in use. In this case, the host part of the address will be set to the unit number plus one. Thus a secrets file contains both secrets for use in authenticating other hosts, plus secrets which we use for authenticating ourselves to others. When pppd is authenticating the peer (checking the peer's identity), it chooses a secret with the peer's name in the first field and the name of the local system in the second field. The name of the local system defaults to the hostname, with the domain name appended if the domain option is used. This default can be overridden with the name option, except when the usehostname option is used. (For EAP SRP-SHA1, see the srp-entry(8) utility for generating proper validator entries to be used in the &quot;secret&quot; field.) When pppd is choosing a secret to use in authenticating itself to the peer, it first determines what name it is going to use to identify itself to the peer. This name can be specified by the user with the user option. If this option is not used, the name defaults to the name of the local system, determined as described in the previous paragraph. Then pppd looks for a secret with this name in the first field and the peer's name in the second field. Pppd will know the name of the peer if CHAP or EAP authentication is being used, because the peer will have sent it in the challenge packet. However, if PAP is being used, pppd will have to determine the peer's name from the options specified by the user. The user can specify the peer's name directly with the remotename option. Otherwise, if the remote IP address was specified by a name (rather than in numeric form), that name will be used as the peer's name. Failing that, pppd will use the null string as the peer's name. When authenticating the peer with PAP, the supplied password is first compared with the secret from the secrets file. If the password doesn't match the secret, the password is encrypted using crypt() and checked against the secret again. Thus secrets for authenticating the peer can be stored in encrypted form if desired. If the papcrypt option is given, the first (unencrypted) comparison is omitted, for better security. Furthermore, if the login option was specified, the username and password are also checked against the system password database. Thus, the system administrator can set up the pap-secrets file to allow PPP access only to certain users, and to restrict the set of IP addresses that each user can use. Typically, when using the login option, the secret in /etc/ppp/pap-secrets would be &quot;&quot;, which will match any password supplied by the peer. This avoids the need to have the same secret in two places. Authentication must be satisfactorily completed before IPCP (or any other Network Control Protocol) can be started. If the peer is required to authenticate itself, and fails to do so, pppd will terminated the link (by closing LCP). If IPCP negotiates an unacceptable IP address for the remote host, IPCP will be closed. IP packets can only be sent or received when IPCP is open. In some cases it is desirable to allow some hosts which can't authenticate themselves to connect and use one of a restricted set of IP addresses, even when the local host generally requires authentication. If the peer refuses to authenticate itself when requested, pppd takes that as equivalent to authenticating with PAP using the empty string for the username and password. Thus, by adding a line to the pap-secrets file which specifies the empty string for the client and password, it is possible to allow restricted access to hosts which refuse to authenticate themselves. Routing When IPCP negotiation is completed successfully, pppd will inform the kernel of the local and remote IP addresses for the ppp interface. This is sufficient to create a host route to the remote end of the link, which will enable the peers to exchange IP packets. Communication with other machines generally requires further modification to routing tables and/or ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) tables. In most cases the defaultroute and/or proxyarp options are sufficient for this, but in some cases further intervention is required. The /etc/ppp/ip-up script can be used for this. Sometimes it is desirable to add a default route through the remote host, as in the case of a machine whose only connection to the Internet is through the ppp interface. The defaultroute option causes pppd to create such a default route when IPCP comes up, and delete it when the link is terminated. In some cases it is desirable to use proxy ARP, for example on a server machine connected to a LAN, in order to allow other hosts to communicate with the remote host. The proxyarp option causes pppd to look for a network interface on the same subnet as the remote host (an interface supporting broadcast and ARP, which is up and not a point-to-point or loopback interface). If found, pppd creates a permanent, published ARP entry with the IP address of the remote host and the hardware address of the network interface found. When the demand option is used, the interface IP addresses have already been set at the point when IPCP comes up. If pppd has not been able to negotiate the same addresses that it used to configure the interface (for example when the peer is an ISP that uses dynamic IP address assignment), pppd has to change the interface IP addresses to the negotiated addresses. This may disrupt existing connections, and the use of demand dialling with peers that do dynamic IP address assignment is not recommended. Multilink Multilink PPP provides the capability to combine two or more PPP links between a pair of machines into a single `bundle', which appears as a single virtual PPP link which has the combined bandwidth of the individual links. Currently, multilink PPP is only supported under Linux. Pppd detects that the link it is controlling is connected to the same peer as another link using the peer's endpoint discriminator and the authenticated identity of the peer (if it authenticates itself). The endpoint discriminator is a block of data which is hopefully unique for each peer. Several types of data can be used, including locally-assigned strings of bytes, IP addresses, MAC addresses, randomly strings of bytes, or E-164 phone numbers. The endpoint discriminator sent to the peer by pppd can be set using the endpoint option. In some circumstances the peer may send no endpoint discriminator or a non-unique value. The bundle option adds an extra string which is added to the peer's endpoint discriminator and authenticated identity when matching up links to be joined together in a bundle. The bundle option can also be used to allow the establishment of multiple bundles between the local system and the peer. Pppd uses a TDB database in /var/run/pppd2.tdb to match up links. Assuming that multilink is enabled and the peer is willing to negotiate multilink, then when pppd is invoked to bring up the first link to the peer, it will detect that no other link is connected to the peer and create a new bundle, that is, another ppp network interface unit. When another pppd is invoked to bring up another link to the peer, it will detect the existing bundle and join its link to it. If the first link terminates (for example, because of a hangup or a received LCP terminate-request) the bundle is not destroyed unless there are no other links remaining in the bundle. Rather than exiting, the first pppd keeps running after its link terminates, until all the links in the bundle have terminated. If the first pppd receives a SIGTERM or SIGINT signal, it will destroy the bundle and send a SIGHUP to the pppd processes for each of the links in the bundle. If the first pppd receives a SIGHUP signal, it will terminate its link but not the bundle. Note: demand mode is not currently supported with multilink. Examples The following examples assume that the /etc/ppp/options file contains the auth option (as in the default /etc/ppp/options file in the ppp distribution). Probably the most common use of pppd is to dial out to an ISP. This can be done with a command such as pppd call isp where the /etc/ppp/peers/isp file is set up by the system administrator to contain something like this: ttyS0 19200 crtscts connect '/usr/sbin/chat -v -f /etc/ppp/chat-isp' noauth In this example, we are using chat to dial the ISP's modem and go through any logon sequence required. The /etc/ppp/chat-isp file contains the script used by chat; it could for example contain something like this: ABORT &quot;NO CARRIER&quot; ABORT &quot;NO DIALTONE&quot; ABORT &quot;ERROR&quot; ABORT &quot;NO ANSWER&quot; ABORT &quot;BUSY&quot; ABORT &quot;Username/Password Incorrect&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;at&quot; OK &quot;at&amp;d0&amp;c1&quot; OK &quot;atdt2468135&quot; &quot;name:&quot; &quot;^Umyuserid&quot; &quot;word:&quot; &quot;\qmypassword&quot; &quot;ispts&quot; &quot;\q^Uppp&quot; &quot;~-^Uppp-~&quot; See the chat(8) man page for details of chat scripts. Pppd can also be used to provide a dial-in ppp service for users. If the users already have login accounts, the simplest way to set up the ppp service is to let the users log in to their accounts and run pppd (installed setuid-root) with a command such as pppd proxyarp To allow a user to use the PPP facilities, you need to allocate an IP address for that user's machine and create an entry in /etc/ppp/pap-secrets, /etc/ppp/chap-secrets, or /etc/ppp/srp-secrets (depending on which authentication method the PPP implementation on the user's machine supports), so that the user's machine can authenticate itself. For example, if Joe has a machine called &quot;joespc&quot; that is to be allowed to dial in to the machine called &quot;server&quot; and use the IP address joespc.my.net, you would add an entry like this to /etc/ppp/pap-secrets or /etc/ppp/chap-secrets: joespc server &quot;joe's secret&quot; joespc.my.net (See srp-entry(8) for a means to generate the server's entry when SRP-SHA1 is in use.) Alternatively, you can create a username called (for example) &quot;ppp&quot;, whose login shell is pppd and whose home directory is /etc/ppp. Options to be used when pppd is run this way can be put in /etc/ppp/.ppprc. If your serial connection is any more complicated than a piece of wire, you may need to arrange for some control characters to be escaped. In particular, it is often useful to escape XON (^Q) and XOFF (^S), using asyncmap a0000. If the path includes a telnet, you probably should escape ^] as well (asyncmap 200a0000). If the path includes an rlogin, you will need to use the escape ff option on the end which is running the rlogin client, since many rlogin implementations are not transparent; they will remove the sequence [0xff, 0xff, 0x73, 0x73, followed by any 8 bytes] from the stream. Diagnostics Messages are sent to the syslog daemon using facility LOG_DAEMON. (This can be overridden by recompiling pppd with the macro LOG_PPP defined as the desired facility.) See the syslog(8) documentation for details of where the syslog daemon will write the messages. On most systems, the syslog daemon uses the /etc/syslog.conf file to specify the destination(s) for syslog messages. You may need to edit that file to suit. The debug option causes the contents of all control packets sent or received to be logged, that is, all LCP, PAP, CHAP, EAP, or IPCP packets. This can be useful if the PPP negotiation does not succeed or if authentication fails. If debugging is enabled at compile time, the debug option also causes other debugging messages to be logged. Debugging can also be enabled or disabled by sending a SIGUSR1 signal to the pppd process. This signal acts as a toggle. Exit Status The exit status of pppd is set to indicate whether any error was detected, or the reason for the link being terminated. The values used are: Pppd has detached, or otherwise the connection was successfully established and terminated at the peer's request. An immediately fatal error of some kind occurred, such as an essential system call failing, or running out of virtual memory. An error was detected in processing the options given, such as two mutually exclusive options being used. Pppd is not setuid-root and the invoking user is not root. The kernel does not support PPP, for example, the PPP kernel driver is not included or cannot be loaded. Pppd terminated because it was sent a SIGINT, SIGTERM or SIGHUP signal. The serial port could not be locked. The serial port could not be opened. The connect script failed (returned a non-zero exit status). The command specified as the argument to the pty option could not be run. The PPP negotiation failed, that is, it didn't reach the point where at least one network protocol (e.g. IP) was running. The peer system failed (or refused) to authenticate itself. The link was established successfully and terminated because it was idle. The link was established successfully and terminated because the connect time limit was reached. Callback was negotiated and an incoming call should arrive shortly. The link was terminated because the peer is not responding to echo requests. The link was terminated by the modem hanging up. The PPP negotiation failed because serial loopback was detected. The init script failed (returned a non-zero exit status). We failed to authenticate ourselves to the peer. Scripts Pppd invokes scripts at various stages in its processing which can be used to perform site-specific ancillary processing. These scripts are usually shell scripts, but could be executable code files instead. Pppd does not wait for the scripts to finish. The scripts are executed as root (with the real and effective user-id set to 0), so that they can do things such as update routing tables or run privileged daemons. Be careful that the contents of these scripts do not compromise your system's security. Pppd runs the scripts with standard input, output and error redirected to /dev/null, and with an environment that is empty except for some environment variables that give information about the link. The environment variables that pppd sets are: DEVICE The name of the serial tty device being used. IFNAME The name of the network interface being used. IPLOCAL The IP address for the local end of the link. This is only set when IPCP has come up. IPREMOTE The IP address for the remote end of the link. This is only set when IPCP has come up. PEERNAME The authenticated name of the peer. This is only set if the peer authenticates itself. SPEED The baud rate of the tty device. ORIG_UID The real user-id of the user who invoked pppd. PPPLOGNAME The username of the real user-id that invoked pppd. This is always set. For the ip-down and auth-down scripts, pppd also sets the following variables giving statistics for the connection: CONNECT_TIME The number of seconds from when the PPP negotiation started until the connection was terminated. BYTES_SENT The number of bytes sent (at the level of the serial port) during the connection. BYTES_RCVD The number of bytes received (at the level of the serial port) during the connection. LINKNAME The logical name of the link, set with the linkname option. DNS1 If the peer supplies DNS server addresses, this variable is set to the first DNS server address supplied. DNS2 If the peer supplies DNS server addresses, this variable is set to the second DNS server address supplied. Pppd invokes the following scripts, if they exist. It is not an error if they don't exist. /etc/ppp/auth-up A program or script which is executed after the remote system successfully authenticates itself. It is executed with the parameters interface-name peer-name user-name tty-device speed Note that this script is not executed if the peer doesn't authenticate itself, for example when the noauth option is used. /etc/ppp/auth-down A program or script which is executed when the link goes down, if /etc/ppp/auth-up was previously executed. It is executed in the same manner with the same parameters as /etc/ppp/auth-up. /etc/ppp/ip-up A program or script which is executed when the link is available for sending and receiving IP packets (that is, IPCP has come up). It is executed with the parameters interface-name tty-device speed local-IP-address remote-IP-address ipparam /etc/ppp/ip-down A program or script which is executed when the link is no longer available for sending and receiving IP packets. This script can be used for undoing the effects of the /etc/ppp/ip-up script. It is invoked in the same manner and with the same parameters as the ip-up script. /etc/ppp/ipv6-up Like /etc/ppp/ip-up, except that it is executed when the link is available for sending and receiving IPv6 packets. It is executed with the parameters interface-name tty-device speed local-link-local-address remote-link-local-address ipparam /etc/ppp/ipv6-down Similar to /etc/ppp/ip-down, but it is executed when IPv6 packets can no longer be transmitted on the link. It is executed with the same parameters as the ipv6-up script. /etc/ppp/ipx-up A program or script which is executed when the link is available for sending and receiving IPX packets (that is, IPXCP has come up). It is executed with the parameters interface-name tty-device speed network-number local-IPX-node-address remote-IPX-node-address local-IPX-routing-protocol remote-IPX-routing-protocol local-IPX-router-name remote-IPX-router-name ipparam pppd-pid The local-IPX-routing-protocol and remote-IPX-routing-protocol field may be one of the following: NONE to indicate that there is no routing protocol RIP to indicate that RIP/SAP should be used NLSP to indicate that Novell NLSP should be used RIP NLSP to indicate that both RIP/SAP and NLSP should be used /etc/ppp/ipx-down A program or script which is executed when the link is no longer available for sending and receiving IPX packets. This script can be used for undoing the effects of the /etc/ppp/ipx-up script. It is invoked in the same manner and with the same parameters as the ipx-up script. Files /var/run/pppn.pid (BSD or Linux), /etc/ppp/pppn.pid (others) Process-ID for pppd process on ppp interface unit n. /var/run/ppp-name.pid (BSD or Linux), /etc/ppp/ppp-name.pid (others) Process-ID for pppd process for logical link name (see the linkname option). /var/run/pppd2.tdb Database containing information about pppd processes, interfaces and links, used for matching links to bundles in multilink operation. May be examined by external programs to obtain information about running pppd instances, the interfaces and devices they are using, IP address assignments, etc. /etc/ppp/pap-secrets Usernames, passwords and IP addresses for PAP authentication. This file should be owned by root and not readable or writable by any other user. Pppd will log a warning if this is not the case. /etc/ppp/chap-secrets Names, secrets and IP addresses for CHAP/MS-CHAP/MS-CHAPv2 authentication. As for /etc/ppp/pap-secrets, this file should be owned by root and not readable or writable by any other user. Pppd will log a warning if this is not the case. /etc/ppp/srp-secrets Names, secrets, and IP addresses for EAP authentication. As for /etc/ppp/pap-secrets, this file should be owned by root and not readable or writable by any other user. Pppd will log a warning if this is not the case. ~/.ppp_pseudonym Saved client-side SRP-SHA1 pseudonym. See the srp-use-pseudonym option for details. /etc/ppp/options System default options for pppd, read before user default options or command-line options. ~/.ppprc User default options, read before /etc/ppp/options.ttyname. /etc/ppp/options.ttyname System default options for the serial port being used, read after ~/.ppprc. In forming the ttyname part of this filename, an initial /dev/ is stripped from the port name (if present), and any slashes in the remaining part are converted to dots. /etc/ppp/peers A directory containing options files which may contain privileged options, even if pppd was invoked by a user other than root. The system administrator can create options files in this directory to permit non-privileged users to dial out without requiring the peer to authenticate, but only to certain trusted peers.

Notes Some limited degree of control can be exercised over a running pppd process by sending it a signal from the list below. SIGINT, SIGTERM These signals cause pppd to terminate the link (by closing LCP), restore the serial device settings, and exit. SIGHUP This signal causes pppd to terminate the link, restore the serial device settings, and close the serial device. If the persist or demand option has been specified, pppd will try to reopen the serial device and start another connection (after the holdoff period). Otherwise pppd will exit. If this signal is received during the holdoff period, it causes pppd to end the holdoff period immediately. SIGUSR1 This signal toggles the state of the debug option. SIGUSR2 This signal causes pppd to renegotiate compression. This can be useful to re-enable compression after it has been disabled as a result of a fatal decompression error. (Fatal decompression errors generally indicate a bug in one or other implementation.)

Regular expressions are widely used in UNIX world. The module re provides full support for Perl-like regular expressions in Python. The re module raises the exception re.error if an error occurs while compiling or using a regular expression. We would cover two important functions, which would be used to handle regular expressions. But a small thing first: There are various characters, which would have special meaning when they are used in regular expression. To avoid any confusion while dealing with regular expressions, we would use Raw Strings as r'expression'. The match Function This function attempts to match RE pattern to string with optional flags. Here is the syntax for this function − re.match(pattern, string, flags=0) Here is the description of the parameters: Parameter Description pattern This is the regular expression to be matched. string This is the string, which would be searched to match the pattern at the beginning of string. flags You can specify different flags using bitwise OR (|). These are modifiers, which are listed in the table below. The re.match function returns a match object on success, None on failure. We usegroup(num) or groups() function of match object to get matched expression. Match Object Methods Description group(num=0) This method returns entire match (or specific subgroup num) groups() This method returns all matching subgroups in a tuple (empty if there weren't any) Example #!/usr/bin/python import re line = &quot;Cats are smarter than dogs&quot; matchObj = re.match( r'(.*) are (.*?) .*', line, re.M|re.I) if matchObj: print &quot;matchObj.group() : &quot;, matchObj.group() print &quot;matchObj.group(1) : &quot;, matchObj.group(1) print &quot;matchObj.group(2) : &quot;, matchObj.group(2) else: print &quot;No match!!&quot; When the above code is executed, it produces following result − matchObj.group() : Cats are smarter than dogs matchObj.group(1) : Cats matchObj.group(2) : smarter The search Function This function searches for first occurrence of RE pattern within string with optional flags. Here is the syntax for this function: re.search(pattern, string, flags=0) Here is the description of the parameters: Parameter Description pattern This is the regular expression to be matched. string This is the string, which would be searched to match the pattern anywhere in the string. flags You can specify different flags using bitwise OR (|). These are modifiers, which are listed in the table below. The re.search function returns a match object on success, none on failure. We use group(num) or groups() function of match object to get matched expression. Match Object Methods Description group(num=0) This method returns entire match (or specific subgroup num) groups() This method returns all matching subgroups in a tuple (empty if there weren't any) Example #!/usr/bin/python import re line = &quot;Cats are smarter than dogs&quot;; searchObj = re.search( r'(.*) are (.*?) .*', line, re.M|re.I) if searchObj: print &quot;searchObj.group() : &quot;, searchObj.group() print &quot;searchObj.group(1) : &quot;, searchObj.group(1) print &quot;searchObj.group(2) : &quot;, searchObj.group(2) else: print &quot;Nothing found!!&quot; When the above code is executed, it produces following result − matchObj.group() : Cats are smarter than dogs matchObj.group(1) : Cats matchObj.group(2) : smarter Matching Versus Searching Python offers two different primitive operations based on regular expressions: match checks for a match only at the beginning of the string, while search checks for a match anywhere in the string (this is what Perl does by default). Example #!/usr/bin/python import re line = &quot;Cats are smarter than dogs&quot;; matchObj = re.match( r'dogs', line, re.M|re.I) if matchObj: print &quot;match --&gt; matchObj.group() : &quot;, matchObj.group() else: print &quot;No match!!&quot; searchObj = re.search( r'dogs', line, re.M|re.I) if searchObj: print &quot;search --&gt; searchObj.group() : &quot;, searchObj.group() else: print &quot;Nothing found!!&quot; When the above code is executed, it produces the following result − No match!! search --&gt; matchObj.group() : dogs Search and Replace One of the most important re methods that use regular expressions is sub. Syntax re.sub(pattern, repl, string, max=0) This method replaces all occurrences of the RE pattern in string with repl, substituting all occurrences unless max provided. This method returns modified string. Example #!/usr/bin/python import re phone = &quot;2004-959-559 # This is Phone Number&quot; # Delete Python-style comments num = re.sub(r'#.*$', &quot;&quot;, phone) print &quot;Phone Num : &quot;, num # Remove anything other than digits num = re.sub(r'\D', &quot;&quot;, phone) print &quot;Phone Num : &quot;, num When the above code is executed, it produces the following result − Phone Num : 2004-959-559 Phone Num : 2004959559 Regular Expression Modifiers: Option Flags Regular expression literals may include an optional modifier to control various aspects of matching. The modifiers are specified as an optional flag. You can provide multiple modifiers using exclusive OR (|), as shown previously and may be represented by one of these − Modifier Description re.I Performs case-insensitive matching. re.L Interprets words according to the current locale. This interpretation affects the alphabetic group (\w and \W), as well as word boundary behavior (\b and \B). re.M Makes $ match the end of a line (not just the end of the string) and makes ^ match the start of any line (not just the start of the string). re.S Makes a period (dot) match any character, including a newline. re.U Interprets letters according to the Unicode character set. This flag affects the behavior of \w, \W, \b, \B. re.X Permits &quot;cuter&quot; regular expression syntax. It ignores whitespace (except inside a set [] or when escaped by a backslash) and treats unescaped # as a comment marker. Regular Expression Patterns Except for control characters, (+ ? . * ^ $ ( ) [ ] { } | \), all characters match themselves. You can escape a control character by preceding it with a backslash. Following table lists the regular expression syntax that is available in Python − Pattern Description ^ Matches beginning of line. $ Matches end of line. . Matches any single character except newline. Using m option allows it to match newline as well. [...] Matches any single character in brackets. [^...] Matches any single character not in brackets re* Matches 0 or more occurrences of preceding expression. re+ Matches 1 or more occurrence of preceding expression. re? Matches 0 or 1 occurrence of preceding expression. re{ n} Matches exactly n number of occurrences of preceding expression. re{ n,} Matches n or more occurrences of preceding expression. re{ n, m} Matches at least n and at most m occurrences of preceding expression. a| b Matches either a or b. (re) Groups regular expressions and remembers matched text. (?imx) Temporarily toggles on i, m, or x options within a regular expression. If in parentheses, only that area is affected. (?-imx) Temporarily toggles off i, m, or x options within a regular expression. If in parentheses, only that area is affected. (?: re) Groups regular expressions without remembering matched text. (?imx: re) Temporarily toggles on i, m, or x options within parentheses. (?-imx: re) Temporarily toggles off i, m, or x options within parentheses. (?#...) Comment. (?= re) Specifies position using a pattern. Doesn't have a range. (?! re) Specifies position using pattern negation. Doesn't have a range. (?&gt; re) Matches independent pattern without backtracking. \w Matches word characters. \W Matches nonword characters. \s Matches whitespace. Equivalent to [\t\n\r\f]. \S Matches nonwhitespace. \d Matches digits. Equivalent to [0-9]. \D Matches nondigits. \A Matches beginning of string. \Z Matches end of string. If a newline exists, it matches just before newline. \z Matches end of string. \G Matches point where last match finished. \b Matches word boundaries when outside brackets. Matches backspace (0x08) when inside brackets. \B Matches nonword boundaries. \n, \t, etc. Matches newlines, carriage returns, tabs, etc. \1...\9 Matches nth grouped subexpression. \10 Matches nth grouped subexpression if it matched already. Otherwise refers to the octal representation of a character code. Regular Expression Examples Literal characters Example Description python Match &quot;python&quot;.

                   NS1:content=" Home Packages Forums Wiki Bugs AUR Download 3G and GPRS modems with pppd From ArchWiki Jump to: navigation, search Note: 3G and GPRS modems with pppd alone Why not to use a pppd wrapper (like wvdial or similar)?. I particularly switched to direct pppd because my previous software sometimes silently exited instead of reconnecting, as it was configured to do, requiring me to travel to manually perform the reconnection. You may be reading this page by the same reason it was written for: you may have finally concluded that the lesser the layers, the less likely the troubles.

The method described supports easy switching between several carriers and 3G and GPRS modes. It has been tested and directly works with no modifications (except for the device name) with: Huawei EM770 MiniPCIe modem (Asus Eee PC 1000H Go internal integrated modem). Huawei E220 and E1552 external USB dongles. Nokia N73 (USB tethering; select &quot;PC Suite&quot; when the phone asks). Nokia CS-15 (lsusb says 0421:0612 Nokia Mobile Phones) Alcatel x310e (carrier: Wind IT) This guide assumes that your modem hardware is properly detected and working. You simply may look at /var/log/messages to discover the device names appeared when the modem is plugged in. Alternatively: root@quark:~# dmesg | grep GSM | grep attached usb 1-6: GSM modem (1-port) converter now attached to ttyUSB0 usb 1-6: GSM modem (1-port) converter now attached to ttyUSB1 usb 1-6: GSM modem (1-port) converter now attached to ttyUSB2 usb 2-2: GSM modem (1-port) converter now attached to ttyUSB3 usb 2-2: GSM modem (1-port) converter now attached to ttyUSB4 In this computer there are 2 devices available: a internal 3G modem (ttyUSB0) and a external 3G dongle (ttyUSB3). The Nokia phones use other device names, like ttyACM0. The extra devices created are useful to get and query the internal modem state while the main one is in use (you may try the cat command on them). To enable some modems you may need the usb_modeswitch package (see the USB 3G Modem wiki for more information). Configuration The following files are also available as netcfg-ppp-mobile-gitAUR[broken link: archived in aur-mirror] in the Arch User Repository. /etc/ppp/options-mobile Create this file: /etc/ppp/options-mobile ttyUSB0 921600 lock crtscts modem passive novj defaultroute noipdefault usepeerdns noauth hide-password persist holdoff 10 maxfail 0 debug The first line is the modem device (ttyUSB0 in the example) and it will be a permanent option while your hardware doesn't changes. You may want to modify some options (see man pppd). The proposed setup tries to keep the connection permanently established, reconnecting when necessary. /etc/ppp/peers Add these files: root@quark:/etc/ppp/peers# ll total 8 -rw-r----- 1 root root 141 Jun 20 19:29 mobile-auth -rw-r----- 1 root root 104 Jun 20 19:29 mobile-noauth lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 13 Jun 20 19:30 provider -&gt; mobile-noauth The provider symlink defines the default peer for pppd, and as you see it points to the mobile-noauth file. It is possible to setup a different file with user/password for each carrier (with mobile-auth being a example) but it seems that this is not necessary (at least, not for Vodafone or Simyo in Spain). /etc/ppp/peers/mobile-auth file /etc/ppp/options-mobile user &quot;your_usr&quot; password &quot;your_pass&quot; connect &quot;/usr/sbin/chat -v -t15 -f /etc/ppp/chatscripts/mobile-modem.chat&quot; /etc/ppp/peers/mobile-noauth file /etc/ppp/options-mobile connect &quot;/usr/sbin/chat -v -t15 -f /etc/ppp/chatscripts/mobile-modem.chat&quot; /etc/ppp/chatscripts Since the chatscripts directory does not exists in Arch, manually create it to place a few new files there: root@quark:/etc/ppp/chatscripts# ll total 44 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 15 Jun 19 19:17 apn -&gt; apn.es.vodafone -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 37 Jun 19 16:27 apn.es.simyo -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 35 Jun 19 16:27 apn.es.vodafone -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 394 Jun 20 19:29 mobile-modem.chat lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 12 Jun 19 18:59 mode -&gt; mode.3G-only -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 29 Jun 19 22:12 mode.3G-only -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 28 Jun 19 17:05 mode.3G-pref -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 29 Jun 19 17:05 mode.GPRS-only -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 28 Jun 19 17:06 mode.GPRS-pref -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 3 Jun 19 23:40 mode.NONE lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 8 Jun 20 19:29 pin -&gt; pin.CODE -rw------- 1 root root 13 Jun 20 19:29 pin.CODE -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 3 Jun 19 23:37 pin.NONE The core script is mobile-modem.chat, which dialogues with the modem and properly inserts another tiny scripts for selecting the APN, GPRS/3G and the PIN code. You probably won't need to modify it. This script is interpreted by the limited (but powerful enough) chat tool, included in the standard ppp package. With the proposed method, you'll keep a little personal file-based &quot;database&quot; of settings. If you exchange the SIM card, to select the new carrier you only need to update the apn symlink to point to the correct apn file and restart the ppp network (for example with killall -HUP pppd). The same for changing between 3G/GPRS forced modes (mode symlink). The other files consist in a single line, which in some cases you may need to modify in order to customize it. /etc/ppp/chatscripts/mobile-modem.chat ABORT 'BUSY' ABORT 'NO CARRIER' ABORT 'VOICE' ABORT 'NO DIALTONE' ABORT 'NO DIAL TONE' ABORT 'NO ANSWER' ABORT 'DELAYED' REPORT CONNECT TIMEOUT 6 '' 'ATQ0' 'OK-AT-OK' 'ATZ' TIMEOUT 3 'OK' @/etc/ppp/chatscripts/pin 'OK\d-AT-OK' 'ATI' 'OK' 'ATZ' 'OK' 'ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &amp;C1 &amp;D2 +FCLASS=0' 'OK' @/etc/ppp/chatscripts/mode 'OK-AT-OK' @/etc/ppp/chatscripts/apn 'OK' 'ATDT*99***1#' TIMEOUT 30 CONNECT '' /etc/ppp/chatscripts/apn.es.vodafone AT+CGDCONT=1,&quot;IP&quot;,&quot;ac.vodafone.es&quot; /etc/ppp/chatscripts/apn.es.simyo AT+CGDCONT=1,&quot;IP&quot;,&quot;gprs-service.com&quot; /etc/ppp/chatscripts/apn.no.telenor AT+CGDCONT=1,&quot;IP&quot;,&quot;Telenor&quot; (of course, you'll have to create your own apn files, replacing &quot;ac.vodafone.es&quot; or &quot;gprs-service.com&quot; by your own APN strings on them). For Telenor, use your mobile phone number (without country code) for both user and password in /etc/ppp/peers/mobile-noauth. /etc/ppp/chatscripts/pin.CODE AT+CPIN=1234 /etc/ppp/chatscripts/pin.NONE AT If your SIM card has the PIN code disabled, you should symlink pin to pin.NONE to avoid sending it. When a SIM card has the PIN code enabled, it is only required to be sent the first time after power on. There is a modem command to query about this, but since I didn't find a reliable way to use it in the chat script, the PIN, when enabled, is always sent. This has no drawbacks, other than a little additional delay also due to the chat script limitations while recovering from the modem error response (if the PIN was no longer required). /etc/ppp/chatscripts/mode.3G-only AT\^SYSCFG=14,2,3fffffff,0,1 /etc/ppp/chatscripts/mode.3G-pref AT\^SYSCFG=2,2,3fffffff,0,1 /etc/ppp/chatscripts/mode.GPRS-only AT\^SYSCFG=13,1,3fffffff,0,0 /etc/ppp/chatscripts/mode.GPRS-pref AT\^SYSCFG=2,1,3fffffff,0,0 /etc/ppp/chatscripts/mode.NONE AT The SYSCFG line in the mode.* files is device-dependent, and likely Huawei-specific. It does not works in Nokia phones (you may symlink mode to mode.NONE, which only sends the AT command with no effect). I had to investigate before achieving success with both EM770 and E220 modems. Despite many forums reporting a &quot;4&quot; trailing code, it seems that the trailing 0/1 number, while optional in E220, becomes mandatory in EM770 for truly switching the mode. At the end of this guide there are explained the available options for this command. As previously said, you may simply link to mode.NONE and use your modem defaults in case of problems. Start the pppd To start the pppd daemon, either run pon/poff or /etc/rc.d/ppp start|stop. In Arch this can be automated to occur at system boot by adding &quot;@ppp&quot; after &quot;network&quot; in the DAEMONS line of /etc/rc.conf (the &quot;@&quot; places it in background, since pppd start may be a bit slow). The log is stored in /var/log/messages. With the above proposed setup, while the new ppp0 interface is up, pppd will automatically set your default route (if none previously existing) as well as the /etc/resolv.conf contents. It seems very reliable handling DNS switchings (the backup is kept in resolv.conf.backup.ppp0, but I never had to manually restore it, even after a power failure). Patch for modem availability after booting If you automate the pppd start, it may occur that the modem device does not exists at the moment of the pppd lauch during the computer boot. This may occur even when the USB modem module load is manually setup in rc.conf: that helps, but the device may be still not always available when pppd comes into scene. The pppd daemon rejects to start when the configured device does not exists, and it doesn't seems to have an option to force it to start (note that in case the device dissapears once pppd is already running, for example by momentarily disconnecting the external 3G USB modem, pppd will continue running and will reconnect once it appears again). The following script may be useful to wait until the hardware is ready. It will typically wait for 0-2 seconds. The modem device is assumed to be the first line on /etc/ppp/options-mobile. It takes an argument with the maximum wait (in seconds). Optionally admits a second argument with a profile name (from /etc/ppp/peers) which will be used to re-run pppd. Do not forget to make the script executable: /etc/ppp/wait-dialup-hardware #!/bin/bash INTERFACE=&quot;/dev/$(head -1 /etc/ppp/options-mobile)&quot; MAX_SECONDS_TIMEOUT=$1 PEER_NAME=$2 dsec=$((${MAX_SECONDS_TIMEOUT} * 10)) for ((retry=0; retry &lt; ${dsec}; retry++)) do if [ -c ${INTERFACE} ]; then logger &quot;$0: OK existing required device ${INTERFACE} (in $((retry / 10)).$((100 * (retry % 10) / 10)) seconds)&quot; break else sleep 0.1 fi done if [ ! -c ${INTERFACE} ]; then logger &quot;$0: ERROR timeout waiting for required device ${INTERFACE}&quot; exit 1 fi if [ ! -z &quot;${PEER_NAME}&quot; ]; then logger &quot;$0: starting pppd for ${PEER_NAME}&quot; setsid nohup pon &quot;${PEER_NAME}&quot; &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &lt; /dev/null &amp; fi exit 0 The script will add a line to /var/log/messages: Jun 1 22:52:08 parsec logger: /etc/ppp/wait-dialup-hardware: OK existing required device /dev/ttyUSB0 (in 1.25 seconds) netcfg hook To use the above script, netcfg users could add the following profile: /etc/network.d/ppp CONNECTION='ppp' INTERFACE='ignore' PEER='mobile-noauth' PPP_TIMEOUT=30 PRE_UP='/etc/ppp/wait-dialup-hardware 10' network hook Users of traditional network setup (instead of netcfg) can use the following trick to launch the wait-dialup-hardware script from the standard /etc/rc.d/ppp service. The example is intended to run the mobile-noauth profile: /etc/ppp/peers/mobile-noauth.wait noauth pty &quot;/etc/ppp/wait-dialup-hardware 10 mobile-noauth&quot; Updating the default provider symlink to point to the new intermediate (fake) mobile-noauth.wait profile, it will simply run the wait-dialup-hardware script from within pppd and, in turn, will restart pppd with the final (non fake) mobile-noauth profile once the hardware is ready. Note that the noauth option in the first line of the fake profile is necessary (even if the final profile does requires authentication). Troubleshooting In case of using a wrong PIN, my modem consistently rejects the APN setting phase (no error in the steps before). This is how /var/log/messages looks like: Jun 20 00:17:30 quark chat[3348]: send (AT+CGDCONT=1,&quot;IP&quot;,&quot;ac.vodafone.es&quot;^M) Jun 20 00:17:31 quark chat[3348]: expect (OK) Jun 20 00:17:31 quark chat[3348]: ^M Jun 20 00:17:31 quark chat[3348]: AT+CGDCONT=1,&quot;IP&quot;,&quot;ac.vodafone.es&quot;^M^M Jun 20 00:17:31 quark chat[3348]: ERROR^M Jun 20 00:17:34 quark chat[3348]: alarm Jun 20 00:17:34 quark chat[3348]: Failed It would be a long story, but I'll simply abbreviate it: if you have just set or changed the PIN in a phone, please reboot the phone and try it in the phone before placing the SIM card in the modem (I'm not sure if the PIN updates take effect just at the moment they are done in the phone menus). In case of frequent manual pppd restarts, as for example when testing configuration options, the EM770 (firmware upgraded to 11.104.16.12.00) sometimes becomes confused. Despite it responds to the AT commands, it gets stuck in a &quot;NO CARRIER&quot; reply (while the 3G network is ok, as a mobile phone may report). This not occurs with the proposed scripts (in case of connection lost, they wait enough time before retrying). With the modem stuck, powering OFF and then ON the computer solves the problem. This is perhaps a firmware bug. Also, when using a PIN, this modem returns a NO CARRIER reply in the first connection try (it seems that a huge wait after setting the PIN helps; anyway the same effect is achieved by the ordinary connection retry). While running, the EM770 is stable, but the E220 or the Nokia phones are far more reliable in the connection phase. Your mileage may vary depending on your hardware. At least for Huawei E870 issuing AT+CFUN=1,1 (meaning restart and go to online mode) seems to fix being stuck with no NO CARRIER without having to reboot. This might be related to network registration being done after restart. You can check AT+COPS? to see if you are actually registered but note you also want a service state of 2 (meaning &quot;valid service&quot; - this is automatically reported by the card as ^SRVST:X on the second ttyUSB) otherwise trying to dial out is hopeless. In the rare case of the card becoming completely stuck (doesnt respond to AT commands anymore) this can be fixed by using pccardctl (pccardctl eject [slot-number]; pccardctl insert [slot-number]). Of course this only works for pcmcia cards but maybe there is a similar trick for USB dongles. AT^SYSCFG Huawei command reference To see the supported values, you can query your own modem sending the &quot;AT^SYSCFG=?&quot; command. AT^SYSCFG=$mode,$acqOrder,$band,$roam,$srvDomain $mode 2=Auto-Select 13=GSM only 14=WCDMA only 16=no Change $acqOrder 0=Automatic 1=GSM prefered 2=WCDMA prefered 3=no Change $band 3fffffff = All other (query list with &quot;AT^SYSCFG=?&quot;) $roam 0=Not Supported 1=Supported 2=no Change $srvDomain 0=Circuit-Switched only 1=Packet-Switched only 2=Circuit- &amp; Packet-Switched 3=Any 4=no Change AT^SYSCFG=? command output on Huawei EM770: ^SYSCFG:(2,13,14,16),(0-3),((80000,&quot;GSM850&quot;),(200000,&quot;GSM1900&quot;),(400380,&quot;GSM900/GSM1800/WCDMA2100&quot;),(4a80000,&quot;GSM850/GSM1900/WCDMA850/WCDMA1900&quot;),(3fffffff,&quot;All Bands&quot;)),(0-2),(0-4) Huawei unsolicited report command reference These appear on the second ttyUSB. ^SRVST Reports the type of service the network your currently registered to is providing (it seems normal to first report 1 and then switch to 2). Depending on the device there might be more types. 0=No service 1=Restricted service 2=Valid service ^MODE Reports the mode you are currently transmitting in. Depending on the device there might be more modes. Note: It seems normal for the device to only go to 5,5/5,6/5,7 when transmitting and fall back to 5,4 when idle. 0,0=No service 3,1=GSM 3,2=GPRS 3,3=EDGE 5,4=WCDMA 5,5=HSDPA 5,6=HSUPA 5,7=HSDPA+HSUPA ^RSSI Reports strength of the mobile signal in form of $rssi,[$ber]. This info can also be optained by issuing AT+CSQ but unless you are registered to a network it seems this just returns the value for the strongest network whenever you are able to use it or not. To give some meaning to this you can convert it to percent by RSSI / 31 * 100. RSSI of 3/4 (about 10% reception) seems to be the absolute minimum to get a (rather flaky) HDSPA connection. $rssi=0-31 (-113dBm + $rssi * 2) or 99 (unknown or not measurable) $ber=Bit-error-rate (only returned by AT+CSQ - always 99?) Automatic PPP For the Nokia CS-15, create (or add to) /etc/udev/rules.d/99-nokia.rules with this line: SUBSYSTEM==&quot;net&quot;, ACTION==&quot;add&quot;, ATTRS{idVendor}==&quot;0421&quot;, ATTRS{idProduct}==&quot;0612&quot;, DEVPATH==&quot;*/ttyACM0&quot;, RUN+=&quot;pon&quot; and it will connect ppp as soon as you plug in the device. You can probably do something similar for the other modems. Operator selection Listing AT+COPS=? returns a list of all available networks in the format of $state,$longname,$shortname,$id,$tech. $state 0=unknown 1=available 2=current 3=forbidden $longname long alphanumeric operator name $shortname short alphanumeric operator name $id numeric operator id $tech 0=GSM (at best you get EDGE here) 2=UTRAN (supports WCDMA/HSDPA/HSUPA) 7=EUTRAN (?) Manual selection You can lock the device to only connect to a specific operator by issuing AT+COPS=1,$format,$operator command. Note: Even the numeric id needs to be quoted. $format 0=long alphanumeric operator name 1=short alphanumeric operator name 2=numeric operator id $operator operator name/id as specfied by $format Automatic selection To let the device decide which operator to use issue AT+COPS=0 command.

It contains package descriptions (PKGBUILDs) that allow you to compile a package from source with makepkg and then install it via pacman. The AUR was created to organize and share new packages from the community and to help expedite popular packages' inclusion into the community repository. This document explains how users can access and utilize the AUR. A good number of new packages that enter the official repositories start in the AUR. In the AUR, users are able to contribute their own package builds (PKGBUILD and related files). The AUR community has the ability to vote for or against packages in the AUR. If a package becomes popular enough — provided it has a compatible license and good packaging technique — it may be entered into the community repository (directly accessible by pacman or abs).

These PKGBUILDs can be built into installable packages using makepkg, then installed using pacman. Ensure the base-devel package group is installed (pacman -S --needed base-devel). Glance over the #FAQ for answers to the most common questions. You may wish to adjust /etc/makepkg.conf to optimize for your processor prior to building packages from the AUR. A significant improvement in compile times can be realized on systems with multi-core processors by adjusting the MAKEFLAGS variable. Users can also enable hardware-specific optimizations in GCC via the CFLAGS variable. See makepkg for more information. History In the beginning, there was ftp://ftp.archlinux.org/incoming, and people contributed by simply uploading the PKGBUILD, the needed supplementary files, and the built package itself to the server. The package and associated files remained there until a Package Maintainer saw the program and adopted it. Then the Trusted User Repositories were born. Certain individuals in the community were allowed to host their own repositories for anyone to use. The AUR expanded on this basis, with the aim of making it both more flexible and more usable. In fact, the AUR maintainers are still referred to as TUs (Trusted Users). Between 2015-06-08 and 2015-08-08 the AUR transitioned from version 3.5.1 to 4.0.0, introducing the use of Git repositories for publishing the PKGBUILDs. Searching The AUR web interface can be found at https://aur.archlinux.org/, and an interface suitable for accessing the AUR from a script can be found at https://aur.archlinux.org/rpc.php. Queries search package names and descriptions via a MySQL LIKE comparison. This allows for more flexible search criteria (e.g. try searching for tool%like%grep instead of tool like grep). If you need to search for a description that contains %, escape it with \%. Installing packages Installing packages from the AUR is a relatively simple process. Essentially: Acquire the tarball which contains the PKGBUILD and possibly other required files, like systemd units and patches (but often not the actual code). Extract the tarball (preferably in a directory set aside just for builds from the AUR) with tar -xvf pkgname.tar.gz. Verify that the PKGBUILD and accompanying files are not malicious or untrustworthy. Run makepkg -sri in the directory where the files are saved. This will download the code, resolve the dependencies with pacman, compile it, package it, install the package, and finally remove the build-time dependencies, which are no longer needed. Prerequisites First ensure that the necessary tools are installed: # pacman -S --needed base-devel The package group base-devel should be sufficient; it includes make and other tools needed for compiling from source. Note: Packages in the AUR assume that the base-devel group is installed, i.e. they do not list the group's members as dependencies explicitly. Next choose an appropriate build directory. A build directory is simply a directory where the package will be made or &quot;built&quot; and can be any directory. The examples in the following sections will use ~/builds as the build directory. Acquire build files Locate the package in the AUR. This is done using the search feature (text field at the top of the AUR home page). Clicking the application's name in the search list brings up an information page on the package. Read through the description to confirm that this is the desired package, note when the package was last updated, and read any comments. There are three well-known methods to aquire the build files without the use of an AUR helper: Download the necessary build files by clicking on the &quot;Download snapshot&quot; link under &quot;Package Actions&quot; on the right hand side. This file should be saved to the build directory or otherwise copied to the directory after downloading. In this example, the file is called foo.tar.gz (standard format is pkgname.tar.gz, if it has been properly submitted). Alternatively you can download the tarball from the terminal, changing directories to the build directory first: $ cd ~/builds $ curl -L -O https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/snapshot/foo.tar.gz It is also possible to clone the Git repository that is labeled as the &quot;Git Clone URL&quot; in the &quot;Package Details&quot;: $ cd ~/build-repos $ git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/foo.git Build and install the package Change directories to the build directory if not already there, then extract the previously downloaded package: $ cd ~/builds $ tar -xvf foo.tar.gz This should create a new directory called foo in the build directory. Note: In the case of a git clone, the extraction process is unnecessary. The git clone has already created the directory foo. Warning: Carefully check all files. cd to the newly created directory and carefully check the PKGBUILD and any .install file for malicious commands. PKGBUILDs are bash scripts containing functions to be executed by makepkg: these functions can contain any valid commands or Bash syntax, so it is totally possible for a PKGBUILD to contain dangerous commands through malice or ignorance on the part of the author. Since makepkg uses fakeroot (and should never be run as root), there is some level of protection but you should never count on it. If in doubt, do not build the package and seek advice on the forums or mailing list. $ cd foo $ nano PKGBUILD $ nano foo.install Make the package. After manually confirming the integrity of the files, run makepkg as a normal user: $ makepkg -sri The -s/--syncdeps switch will automatically resolve and install any dependencies with pacman before building, -r/--rmdeps removes the build-time dependencies after build, as they are no longer needed, and -i/--install will install the package itself. Note: The above example is only a brief summary of the build process. It is highly recommended to read the makepkg and ABS articles for more details. Feedback The AUR Web Interface has a comments facility that allows users to provide suggestions and feedback on improvements to the PKGBUILD contributor. Avoid pasting patches or PKGBUILDs into the comments section: they quickly become obsolete and just end up needlessly taking up lots of space. Instead email those files to the maintainer, or even use a pastebin. One of the easiest activities for all Arch users is to browse the AUR and vote for their favourite packages using the online interface. All packages are eligible for adoption by a TU for inclusion in the community repository, and the vote count is one of the considerations in that process; it is in everyone's interest to vote! Sharing and maintaining packages Note: Please see Talk:Arch User Repository#Scope of the AUR4 section before making changes to this section. Users can share PKGBUILDs using the Arch User Repository. It does not contain any binary packages but allows users to upload PKGBUILDs that can be downloaded by others. These PKGBUILDs are completely unofficial and have not been thoroughly vetted, so they should be used at your own risk. Submitting packages Warning: Before attempting to submit a package you are expected to familiarize yourself with Arch packaging standards and all the articles under &quot;Related articles&quot;. Rules of submission Merge-arrows-2.pngThis article or section is a candidate for merging with Arch packaging standards#AUR packages.Merge-arrows-2.png Notes: Keep the info in one place. (Discuss in Talk:Arch_packaging_standards#Update_&quot;Submitting_packages_to_the_AUR&quot;_section) When submitting a package, observe the following rules: Check the official package database for the package. If any version of it exists, do not submit the package. If the official package is out-of-date, flag it as such. If the official package is broken or is lacking a feature, then please file a bug report. Check the AUR for the package. If it is currently maintained, changes can be submitted in a comment for the maintainer's attention. If it is unmaintained, the package can be adopted and updated as required. Do not create duplicate packages. Verify carefully that what you are uploading is correct. All contributors must read and adhere to the Arch packaging standards when writing PKGBUILDs. This is essential to the smooth running and general success of the AUR. Remember that you are not going to earn any credit or respect from your peers by wasting their time with a bad PKGBUILD. Packages that contain binaries or that are very poorly written may be deleted without warning. If you are unsure about the package (or the build/submission process) in any way, submit the PKGBUILD to the AUR mailing list or the AUR forum on the Arch forums for public review before adding it to the AUR. Make sure the package is useful. Will anyone else want to use this package? Is it extremely specialized? If more than a few people would find this package useful, it is appropriate for submission. The AUR and official repositories are intended for packages which install generally software and software-related content, including one or more of the following: executable(s); config file(s); online or offline documentation for specific software or the Arch Linux distribution as a whole; media intended to be used directly by software. Gain some experience before submitting packages. Build a few packages to learn the process and then submit. Authentication For write access to the AUR, you need to have an SSH key pair. The content of the public key needs to be copied to your profile in My Account, and the corresponding private key configured for the aur.archlinux.org host. For example: ~/.ssh/config Host aur.archlinux.org IdentityFile ~/.ssh/aur User aur You should create a new key pair rather than use an existing one, so that you can selectively revoke the keys should something happen. Note: You can add multiple public keys to your profile by seperating them with a newline in the input field. Creating a new package In order to create a new, empty, local Git repository for a package, simply git clone the remote repository with the corresponding name. If the package does not exist on AUR yet, you will see the following warning: $ git clone git+ssh://aur@aur.archlinux.org/package_name.git Cloning into 'package_name'... warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository. Checking connectivity... done. If you have already created a git repository, you can simply create a remote for the AUR git repository and then fetch it: $ git remote add remote_name git+ssh://aur@aur.archlinux.org/package_name.git $ git fetch remote_name where remote_name is the name of the remote to create (e.g., &quot;origin&quot;). See Git#Using remotes for more information. The new package will appear on AUR after you push the first commit. You can now add the source files to the local copy of the Git repository. See #Uploading packages. Warning: Your AUR commits will be authored according to your git user name and email address and it is very difficult to change commits after you push them (see FS#45425). If you want to push to AUR under a different name/email, you can change them for this package via git config user.name [...] and git config user.email [...]. Review your commits before pushing them! Uploading packages Tango-view-fullscreen.pngThis article or section needs expansion.Tango-view-fullscreen.png Reason: Recommend to add * to .gitignore and use git add -f to keep the working directory clean as much as possible, see dotfiles#Using gitignore (Discuss in Talk:Arch User Repository#gitignore) The procedure for uploading packages to the AUR is the same for new packages and package updates. You need at least PKGBUILD and .SRCINFO in the top-level directory to push your package to AUR. To upload, add the PKGBUILD, .SRCINFO, and any helper files (like .install files or local source files like .patch) to the staging area with git add, commit them to your local tree with a commit message with git commit, and finally publish the changes to the AUR with git push. For example: $ makepkg --printsrcinfo &gt; .SRCINFO $ git add PKGBUILD .SRCINFO $ git commit -m &quot;useful commit message&quot; $ git push Tip: If you initially forgot to commit the .SRCINFO and added it in a later commit, the AUR will still reject your pushes because the .SRCINFO must exist for every commit. To solve this problem you can use git rebase with the --root option or git filter-branch with the --tree-filter option. Maintaining packages If you maintain a package and want to update the PKGBUILD for your package just resubmit it. Check for feedback and comments from other users and try to incorporate any improvements they suggest; consider it a learning process! Please do not leave a comment containing the version number every time you update the package. This keeps the comment section usable for valuable content mentioned above. AUR helpers are suited better to check for updates. Please do not just submit and forget about packages! It is the maintainer's job to maintain the package by checking for updates and improving the PKGBUILD. If you do not want to continue to maintain the package for some reason, disown the package using the AUR web interface and/or post a message to the AUR Mailing List. Other requests Disownment requests and removal requests can be created by clicking on the &quot;Submit Request&quot; link under &quot;Package Actions&quot; on the right hand side. This automatically sends a notification email to the current package maintainer and to the aur-requests mailing list for discussion. Trusted Users will then either accept or reject the request. Disownment requests will be granted after two weeks if the current maintainer did not react. Package merging has been implemented, users still have to resubmit a package under a new name and may request merging of the old version's comments and votes. Removal requests require the following information: Reason for deletion, at least a short note Notice: A package's comments does not sufficiently point out the reasons why a package is up for deletion. Because as soon as a TU takes action, the only place where such information can be obtained is the aur-requests mailing list. Supporting details, like when a package is provided by another package, if you are the maintainer yourself, it is renamed and the original owner agreed, etc. For merge requests: Name of the package base to merge into. Removal requests can be disapproved, in which case you will likely be advised to disown the package for a future packager's reference. Git repositories for AUR3 packages On 08/08/2015 unmaintained packages have been removed from the AUR with the migration to a Git backend. A Git repository of the old AUR contents is available at git://pkgbuild.com/aur-mirror.git. It was generally updated once per day and is now read-only. If the repository's commit history is not needed, then cloning with the --depth=1 option will be much quicker: $ git clone --depth=1 git://pkgbuild.com/aur-mirror.git You can also visit http://pkgbuild.com/git/aur-mirror.git/tree/&lt;packagename&gt; directly as trying to load http://pkgbuild.com/git/aur-mirror.git/tree in a web browser is going to use a lot of time and memory. For more information, see the following: Git Web interface, forum thread. There is also the AUR Archive on GitHub with a repository for every package that was in AUR 3 during the migration to AUR 4. Web interface translation See i18n.txt in the AUR source tree for information about creating and maintaining translation of the AUR web interface. FAQ What is the AUR? The AUR (Arch User Repository) is a place where the Arch Linux community can upload PKGBUILDs of applications, libraries, etc., and share them with the entire community. Fellow users can then vote for their favorites to be moved into the community repository to be shared with Arch Linux users in binary form. What kind of packages are permitted on the AUR? The packages on the AUR are merely &quot;build scripts&quot;, i.e. recipes to build binaries for pacman. For most cases, everything is permitted, subject to the abovementioned usefulness and scope guidelines, as long as you are in compliance with the licensing terms of the content. For other cases, where it is mentioned that &quot;you may not link&quot; to downloads, i.e. contents that are not redistributable, you may only use the file name itself as the source. This means and requires that users already have the restricted source in the build directory prior to building the package. When in doubt, ask. How can I vote for packages in the AUR? Sign up on the AUR website to get a &quot;Vote for this package&quot; option while browsing packages. After signing up it is also possible to vote from the commandline with aurvote-gitAUR. What is a Trusted User / TU? A Trusted User, in short TU, is a person who is chosen to oversee AUR and the community repository. They are the ones who maintain popular PKGBUILDs in community, and overall keep the AUR running. What is the difference between the Arch User Repository and the community repository? The Arch User Repository is where all PKGBUILDs that users submit are stored, and must be built manually with makepkg. When PKGBUILDs receive enough community interest and the support of a TU, they are moved into the community repository (maintained by the TUs), where the binary packages can be installed with pacman. Foo in the AUR is outdated; what do I do? For starters, you can flag packages out-of-date. If it stays out-of-date for an extended period of time, the best thing to do is email the maintainer. If there is no response from the maintainer after two weeks, you can file an orphan request. When we are talking about a package which is flagged out of date for more than 3 months and is in general not updated for a long time, please add this in your orphan request. In the meantime, you can try updating the package yourself by editing the PKGBUILD - sometimes updates do not require any changes to the build or package process, in which case simply updating the pkgver or source array is sufficient. Foo in the AUR does not compile when I run makepkg; what should I do? You are probably missing something trivial. Run pacman -Syyu before compiling anything with makepkg as the problem may be that your system is not up-to-date. Ensure you have both &quot;base&quot; and &quot;base-devel&quot; groups installed. Try using the &quot;-s&quot; option with makepkg to check and install all the dependencies needed before starting the build process. Be sure to first read the PKGBUILD and the comments on the AUR page of the package in question. The reason might not be trivial after all. Custom CFLAGS, LDFLAGS and MAKEFLAGS can cause failures. It is also possible that the PKGBUILD is broken for everyone. If you cannot figure it out on your own, just report it to the maintainer e.g. by posting the errors you are getting in the comments on the AUR page. How do I make a PKGBUILD? The best resource is the wiki page about creating packages. Remember to look in AUR before creating the PKGBUILD as to not duplicate efforts. I have a PKGBUILD I would like to submit; can someone check it to see if there are any errors? If you would like to have your PKGBUILD critiqued, post it on the aur-general mailing list to get feedback from the TUs and fellow AUR members. You could also get help from the IRC channel, #archlinux on irc.freenode.net. You can also use namcap to check your PKGBUILD and the resulting package for errors. How to get a PKGBUILD into the community repository? Usually, at least 10 votes are required for something to move into community. However, if a TU wants to support a package, it will often be found in the repository. Reaching the required minimum of votes is not the only requirement, there has to be a TU willing to maintain the package. TUs are not required to move a package into the community repository even if it has thousands of votes. Usually when a very popular package stays in the AUR it is because: Arch Linux already has another version of a package in the repositories The package is AUR-centric (e.g. an AUR helper) Its license prohibits redistribution See also DeveloperWiki:Community repo candidates and Rules for Packages Entering the community Repo. How can I speed up repeated build processes? If you frequently compile code that uses GCC - say, a Git or SVN package - you may find ccache, short for &quot;compiler cache&quot;, useful. What is the difference between foo and foo-git packages? Many AUR packages are presented in regular (&quot;stable&quot;) and development versions (&quot;unstable&quot;). A development package usually has a suffix such as -cvs, -svn, -git, -hg, -bzr or -darcs. While development packages are not intended for regular use, they may offer new features or bugfixes. Because these packages download the latest available source when you execute makepkg, a package version to track possible updates is not directly available for these. Likewise, these packages cannot perform an authenticity checksum, instead it is relied on the maintainer(s) of the Git repository. See also System maintenance#Use proven software packages. Why has foo disappeared from the AUR? Packages may be deleted, if they did not fulfill the #Rules of submission. See the aur-requests archives for the reason for deletion. If the package used to exist in AUR3, it might not have been migrated to AUR4. See the #Git repositories for AUR3 packages where these are preserved. How do I find out if any of my installed packages disappeared from AUR? The simplest way is to check the HTTP status of the package's AUR page: #!/bin/bash for pkg in $(pacman -Qqm); do if ! curl -sILfo /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' &quot;https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/$pkg&quot; | grep -q '^2'; then echo &quot;$pkg is missing!&quot; fi done If you use an AUR helper, you can shorten this script by replacing the curl command with whatever command queries the AUR for a package.

The BeagleBone Black Rev C has 4GB of eMMC storage that can be initialized by a program booted off of a microSD card. If you want to update to the latest software image for your board, this is a way to do that. See updates for the step-by-step guide. Information about getting the source code for the image shipped with your board can be found at beagleboard.org/source, along with instructions for rebuilding it. BoneScript interactive guide BoneScript is a JavaScript library to simplify learning how to perform physical computing tasks using your embedded Linux. This web page is able to interact with your board to provide an interactive tutorial. Example run restore var b = require('bonescript'); b.pinMode('USR0', b.OUTPUT); b.pinMode('USR1', b.OUTPUT); b.pinMode('USR2', b.OUTPUT); b.pinMode('USR3', b.OUTPUT); b.digitalWrite('USR0', b.HIGH); b.digitalWrite('USR1', b.HIGH); b.digitalWrite('USR2', b.HIGH); b.digitalWrite('USR3', b.HIGH); setTimeout(restore, 2000); Running the above example will cause all of your LEDs to light up at once for a couple of seconds. To learn more about Bonescript, please continue exploring this interactive guide. Cloud9 IDE To begin editing programs that live on your board, you can use the Cloud9 IDE. If your board is plugged into your USB port, click on the &quot;Cloud9 IDE&quot; link above to start the editor. As a simple exercise to become familiar with Cloud9 IDE and the Bonescript JavaScript library, creating a simple application to blink one of the 4 user programmable LEDs on the BeagleBone is a good start. Step A: Close any open file tabs. Step B: Click the &quot;+&quot; in the top-right to create a new file. Step C: Cut and paste the following code into the new tab: var b = require('bonescript'); var state = b.LOW; b.pinMode(&quot;USR0&quot;, b.OUTPUT); b.pinMode(&quot;USR1&quot;, b.OUTPUT); b.pinMode(&quot;USR2&quot;, b.OUTPUT); b.pinMode(&quot;USR3&quot;, b.OUTPUT); setInterval(toggle, 1000); function toggle() { if(state == b.LOW) state = b.HIGH; else state = b.LOW; b.digitalWrite(&quot;USR3&quot;, state); } Step D: Save the file by clicking the disk icon and giving the file a name with the .js extension. Step E: Run the code by selecting the arrow to the right of &quot;run&quot; (or &quot;debug&quot;) in the toolbar to pull down the list of files to run and select your new file. Step F: Observe the BeagleBone USR3 LED blinking steadily about 5 times a second. Step G: Stop the code by clicking &quot;stop&quot; in the toolbar. Additional information about the Bonescript library is available in the presentation viewed in the next step and on-line at http://beagleboard.org/project/bonescript. Autorun Once you've finished developing your JavaScript application, you can have it start upon boot-up by simply dropping it into the 'autorun' subfolder (located at /var/lib/cloud9/autorun in the file system). The systemd bonescript-autorun.service runs at start-up and uses the /usr/lib/node_modules/bonescript/autorun.js script to automatically detect when .js files are in this directory and invoke them as separate processes with node.js. When the files are changed or moved, the script will kill the processes. Resources To learn more about Cloud9 IDE and to synchronize the software on your board with cloud-hosted services, see www.c9.io. For more information on Node.JS, the JavaScript interpreter, see www.nodejs.org. Note that version 0.10.25 is what is currently installed on the default image and you can find the api documentation at www.nodejs.org/docs/v0.10.25/api. For more information about the Bonescript library, see www.beagleboard.org/bonescript.

Always read the System Reference Manual!!! Design materials Design materials for creating your own customized version of the hardware or for better understanding the design are also linked from the traditional home of &quot;http://beagleboard.org/hardware/design&quot; BeagleBone Black hardware details Revision A5 also provides a POWER button that can be used to enter and exit hibernate modes once that feature is implemented in the software. Headers The expansion headers provide extensive I/O capabitilities. Each digital I/O pin has 8 different modes that can be selected, including GPIO. In GPIO mode, each digital I/O can produce interrupts. Up to 8 digital I/O pins can be configured with pulse-width modulators (PWM) to produce signals to control motors or create analog voltage levels, without taking up any extra CPU cycles. Make sure you don't input more than 1.8V to the analog input pins. This is a single 12-bit analog-to-digital converter with 8 channels, 7 of which are made available on the headers. There is a dedicated header for getting to the UART0 pins and connecting a debug cable. Five additional serial ports are brought to the expansion headers, but one of them only has a single direction brought to the headers. The first I2C bus is utilized for reading EEPROMS on cape add-on boards and can't be used for other digital I/O operations without interfering with that function, but you can still use it to add other I2C devices at available addresses. The second I2C bus is available for you to configure and use. For shifting out data fast, you might consider using one of the SPI ports. Advanced users can also make use of 2 built-in 32-bit 200-MHz microcontrollers called Programmable Real-time Units (PRUs) for performing real-time tasks. Each PRU has some pins associated with it tied directly to registers for super-low-latency access. Capes Capes are really just daughterboards for BeagleBone and BeagleBone Black, but we refer to them enough that a short name makes sense. BeagleBone wears them, they typically have a cut-out around the Ethernet connector that gives them a cape-like shape and Underdog is a Beagle! The beaglebonecapes.com site attempts to consolidate the currently available cape add-on boards for BeagleBone and BeagleBone Black. The types of capes available is quite diverse, from 3D printer capes and touchscreen displays to wireless communications and FPGA-based prototyping tools. Every cape that utilizes pins on the expansion header is expected to notify software on the board by providing contents within EEPROM connected to I2C2 with an address from 0x54 to 0x57. To work with other capes, you can make your address selectable between those values to avoid conflicts. It is also possible to provide through connectors such that other capes can also get connections to the cape header pins Headers on BeagleBone Black BeagleBone Black ships with two virtual capes already on it, one for the on-board eMMC storage and one for the HDMI output. When configured for use these virtual capes consume actual resources. If the eMMC is not placed in reset, the MMC1* signals may not be used without potentially corrupting the contents of your on-board eMMC---and possibly damaging the physical circuit as well. The HDMI signals are all inputs to the HDMI device, so there is no need to put the HDMI device into reset, but using those pins for other operations will cause the HDMI output to be disrupted. However, note that the Linux software typically allocates these for use by the HDMI driver, so your software might not be able to get access to them without unloading that driver.

This chapter covers every basic command you need to do the vast majority of the things you’ll eventually spend your time doing with Git. By the end of the chapter, you should be able to configure and initialize a repository, begin and stop tracking files, and stage and commit changes. We’ll also show you how to set up Git to ignore certain files and file patterns, how to undo mistakes quickly and easily, how to browse the history of your project and view changes between commits, and how to push and pull from remote repositories. Getting a Git Repository You can get a Git project using two main approaches. The first takes an existing project or directory and imports it into Git. The second clones an existing Git repository from another server. Initializing a Repository in an Existing Directory If you’re starting to track an existing project in Git, you need to go to the project’s directory and type: $ git init This creates a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of your necessary repository files – a Git repository skeleton. At this point, nothing in your project is tracked yet. (See Git Internals for more information about exactly what files are contained in the .git directory you just created.) If you want to start version-controlling existing files (as opposed to an empty directory), you should probably begin tracking those files and do an initial commit. You can accomplish that with a few git add commands that specify the files you want to track, followed by a git commit: $ git add *.c $ git add LICENSE $ git commit -m 'initial project version' We’ll go over what these commands do in just a minute. At this point, you have a Git repository with tracked files and an initial commit. Cloning an Existing Repository If you want to get a copy of an existing Git repository – for example, a project you’d like to contribute to – the command you need is git clone. If you’re familiar with other VCS systems such as Subversion, you’ll notice that the command is &quot;clone&quot; and not &quot;checkout&quot;. This is an important distinction – instead of getting just a working copy, Git receives a full copy of nearly all data that the server has. Every version of every file for the history of the project is pulled down by default when you run git clone. In fact, if your server disk gets corrupted, you can often use nearly any of the clones on any client to set the server back to the state it was in when it was cloned (you may lose some server-side hooks and such, but all the versioned data would be there – see Getting Git on a Server for more details). You clone a repository with git clone [url]. For example, if you want to clone the Git linkable library called libgit2, you can do so like this: $ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2 That creates a directory named “libgit2”, initializes a .git directory inside it, pulls down all the data for that repository, and checks out a working copy of the latest version. If you go into the new libgit2 directory, you’ll see the project files in there, ready to be worked on or used. If you want to clone the repository into a directory named something other than “libgit2”, you can specify that as the next command-line option: $ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2 mylibgit That command does the same thing as the previous one, but the target directory is called mylibgit. Git has a number of different transfer protocols you can use. The previous example uses the https:// protocol, but you may also see git:// or user@server:path/to/repo.git, which uses the SSH transfer protocol. Getting Git on a Server will introduce all of the available options the server can set up to access your Git repository and the pros and cons of each. prev | next This open sourced site is hosted on GitHub.

                   NS1:content=" pythonforbeginners.com Home Learn Python Basics Lists Dictionary Code Snippets Modules Home &gt;&gt; How to use urllib2 in Python Feb. 22, 2013 Urllib2 Web &amp; Internet How to use urllib2 in Python Overview While the title of this posts says &quot;Urllib2&quot;, we are going to show some examples where you use urllib, since they are often used together. This is going to be an introduction post of urllib2, where we are going to focus on Getting URLs, Requests, Posts, User Agents and Error handling. Please see the official documentation for more information. Also, this article is written for Python version 2.x HTTP is based on requests and responses - the client makes requests and servers send responses. A program on the Internet can work as a client (access resources) or as a server (makes services available). An URL identifies a resource on the Internet. What is Urllib2? urllib2 is a Python module that can be used for fetching URLs. It defines functions and classes to help with URL actions (basic and digest authentication, redirections, cookies, etc) The magic starts with importing the urllib2 module. What is the difference between urllib and urllib2? While both modules do URL request related stuff, they have different functionality urllib2 can accept a Request object to set the headers for a URL request, urllib accepts only a URL. urllib provides the urlencode method which is used for the generation of GET query strings, urllib2 doesn't have such a function. Because of that urllib and urllib2 are often used together. Please see the documentation for more information. Urllib Urllib2 What is urlopen? urllib2 offers a very simple interface, in the form of the urlopen function. This function is capable of fetching URLs using a variety of different protocols (HTTP, FTP, ...) Just pass the URL to urlopen() to get a &quot;file-like&quot; handle to the remote data. Additionaly, urllib2 offers an interface for handling common situations - like basic authentication, cookies, proxies and so on. These are provided by objects called handlers and openers. Getting URLs This is the most basic way to use the library. Below you can see how to make a simple request with urllib2. Begin by importing the urllib2 module. Place the response in a variable (response) The response is now a file-like object. Read the data from the response into a string (html) Do something with that string. Note if there is a space in the URL, you will need to parse it using urlencode. Let's see an example of how this works. import urllib2 response = urllib2.urlopen('http://pythonforbeginners.com/') print response.info() html = response.read() # do something response.close() # best practice to close the file Note: you can also use an URL starting with &quot;ftp:&quot;, &quot;file:&quot;, etc.). The remote server accepts the incoming values and formats a plain text response to send back. The return value from urlopen() gives access to the headers from the HTTP server through the info() method, and the data for the remote resource via methods like read() and readlines(). Additionally, the file object that is returned by urlopen() is iterable. Simple urllib2 script Let's show another example of a simple urllib2 script import urllib2 response = urllib2.urlopen('http://python.org/') print &quot;Response:&quot;, response # Get the URL. This gets the real URL. print &quot;The URL is: &quot;, response.geturl() # Getting the code print &quot;This gets the code: &quot;, response.code # Get the Headers. # This returns a dictionary-like object that describes the page fetched, # particularly the headers sent by the server print &quot;The Headers are: &quot;, response.info() # Get the date part of the header print &quot;The Date is: &quot;, response.info()['date'] # Get the server part of the header print &quot;The Server is: &quot;, response.info()['server'] # Get all data html = response.read() print &quot;Get all data: &quot;, html # Get only the length print &quot;Get the length :&quot;, len(html) # Showing that the file object is iterable for line in response: print line.rstrip() # Note that the rstrip strips the trailing newlines and carriage returns before # printing the output. Download files with Urllib2 This small script will download a file from pythonforbeginners.com website import urllib2 # file to be written to file = &quot;downloaded_file.html&quot; url = &quot;http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/&quot; response = urllib2.urlopen(url) #open the file for writing fh = open(file, &quot;w&quot;) # read from request while writing to file fh.write(response.read()) fh.close() # You can also use the with statement: with open(file, 'w') as f: f.write(response.read()) The difference in this script is that we use 'wb' , which means that we open the file binary. import urllib2 mp3file = urllib2.urlopen(&quot;http://www.example.com/songs/mp3.mp3&quot;) output = open('test.mp3','wb') output.write(mp3file.read()) output.close() Urllib2 Requests The Request object represents the HTTP request you are making. In its simplest form you create a request object that specifies the URL you want to fetch. Calling urlopen with this Request object returns a response object for the URL requested. The request function under the urllib2 class accepts both url and parameter. When you don't include the data (and only pass the url), the request being made is actually a GET request When you do include the data, the request being made is a POST request, where the url will be your post url, and the parameter will be http post content. Let's take a look at the example below import urllib2 import urllib # Specify the url url = 'http://www.pythonforbeginners.com' # This packages the request (it doesn't make it) request = urllib2.Request(url) # Sends the request and catches the response response = urllib2.urlopen(request) # Extracts the response html = response.read() # Print it out print html You can set the outgoing data on the Request to post it to the server. Additionally, you can pass data extra information(&quot;metadata&quot;) about the data or the about request itself, to the server - this information is sent as HTTP &quot;headers&quot;. If you want to POST data, you have to first create the data to a dictionary. Make sure that you understand what the code does. # Prepare the data query_args = { 'q':'query string', 'foo':'bar' } # This urlencodes your data (that's why we need to import urllib at the top) data = urllib.urlencode(query_args) # Send HTTP POST request request = urllib2.Request(url, data) response = urllib2.urlopen(request) html = response.read() # Print the result print html User Agents The way a browser identifies itself is through the User-Agent header. By default urllib2 identifies itself as Python-urllib/x.y where x and y are the major and minor version numbers of the Python release. This could confuse the site, or just plain not work. With urllib2 you can add your own headers with urllib2. The reason why you would want to do that is that some websites dislike being browsed by programs. If you are creating an application that will access other people’s web resources, it is courteous to include real user agent information in your requests, so they can identify the source of the hits more easily. When you create the Request object you can add your headers to a dictionary, and use the add_header() to set the user agent value before opening the request. That would look something like this: # Importing the module import urllib2 # Define the url url = 'http://www.google.com/#q=my_search' # Add your headers headers = {'User-Agent' : 'Mozilla 5.10'} # Create the Request. request = urllib2.Request(url, None, headers) # Getting the response response = urllib2.urlopen(request) # Print the headers print response.headers You can also add headers with &quot;add_header()&quot; syntax: Request.add_header(key, val) urllib2.Request.add_header The example below, use the Mozilla 5.10 as a User Agent, and that is also what will show up in the web server log file. import urllib2 req = urllib2.Request('http://192.168.1.2/') req.add_header('User-agent', 'Mozilla 5.10') res = urllib2.urlopen(req) html = res.read() print html This is what will show up in the log file. “GET / HTTP/1.1? 200 151 “-” “Mozilla 5.10? urllib.urlparse The urlparse module provides functions to analyze URL strings. It defines a standard interface to break Uniform Resource Locator (URL) strings up in several optional parts, called components, known as (scheme, location, path, query and fragment) Let's say you have an url: http://www.python.org:80/index.html The scheme would be http The location would be www.python.org:80 The path is index.html We don't have any query and fragment The most common functions are urljoin and urlsplit import urlparse url = &quot;http://python.org&quot; domain = urlparse.urlsplit(url)[1].split(':')[0] print &quot;The domain name of the url is: &quot;, domain For more information about urlparse, please see the official documentation. urllib.urlencode When you pass information through a URL, you need to make sure it only uses specific allowed characters. Allowed characters are any alphabetic characters, numerals, and a few special characters that have meaning in the URL string. The most commonly encoded character is the space character. You see this character whenever you see a plus-sign (+) in a URL. This represents the space character. The plus sign acts as a special character representing a space in a URL Arguments can be passed to the server by encoding them with and appending them to the URL. Let's take a look at the following example. import urllib import urllib2 query_args = { 'q':'query string', 'foo':'bar' } # you have to pass in a dictionary encoded_args = urllib.urlencode(query_args) print 'Encoded:', encoded_args url = 'http://python.org/?' + encoded_args print urllib2.urlopen(url).read() If I would print this now, I would get an encoded string like this: q=query+string&amp;foo=bar Python's urlencode takes variable/value pairs and creates a properly escaped querystring: from urllib import urlencode artist = &quot;Kruder &amp; Dorfmeister&quot; artist = urlencode({'ArtistSearch':artist}) This sets the variable artist equal to: Output : ArtistSearch=Kruder+%26+Dorfmeister Error Handling This section of error handling is based on the information from Voidspace.org.uk great article: &quot;Urllib2 - The Missing Manual&quot; urlopen raises URLError when it cannot handle a response. HTTPError is the subclass of URLError raised in the specific case of HTTP URLs. URLError Often, URLError is raised because there is no network connection, or the specified server doesn't exist. In this case, the exception raised will have a 'reason' attribute, which is a tuple containing an error code and a text error message. Example of URLError req = urllib2.Request('http://www.pretend_server.org') try: urllib2.urlopen(req) except URLError, e: print e.reason (4, 'getaddrinfo failed') HTTPError Every HTTP response from the server contains a numeric &quot;status code&quot;. Sometimes the status code indicates that the server is unable to fulfill the request. The default handlers will handle some of these responses for you (for example, if the response is a &quot;redirection&quot; that requests the client fetch the document from a different URL, urllib2 will handle that for you). For those it can't handle, urlopen will raise an HTTPError. Typical errors include '404' (page not found), '403' (request forbidden), and '401' (authentication required). When an error is raised the server responds by returning an HTTP error code and an error page. You can use the HTTPError instance as a response on the page returned. This means that as well as the code attribute, it also has read, geturl, and info, methods. req = urllib2.Request('http://www.python.org/fish.html') try: urllib2.urlopen(req) except URLError, e: print e.code print e.read() from urllib2 import Request, urlopen, URLError req = Request(someurl) try: response = urlopen(req) except URLError, e: if hasattr(e, 'reason'): print 'We failed to reach a server.' print 'Reason: ', e.reason elif hasattr(e, 'code'): print 'The server could not fulfill the request.' print 'Error code: ', e.code else: # everything is fine Please take a look at the links below to get more understanding of the Urllib2 library.

Pass the end through the loop. Twist the loop to create the next hole for the end to pass through. Repeat as often as required to complete the braid. Braiding a Single Rope Details Uses: Braiding several strands is often learned in childhood as a way of controlling long hair. This animation demonstrates how to make a braid with a single piece of rope. Methods: The animation shows the braid being tied with the rope's end being threaded through the loop. In practice braiding is made in the usual way. The strands are manipulated close against the braid ignoring the fact that the end and the loop are getting tangled. Then after adding several braids, the end is pulled clear of the loop. Disclaimer: Any activity that involves ropes is potentially hazardous. Lives may be at risk - possibly your own. Considerable attention and effort have been made to ensure that these descriptions are accurate. However, many critical factors cannot be controlled, including: the choice of materials; the age, size, and condition of ropes; and the accuracy with which these descriptions have been followed.

This tool will be very helpful for calligraphers who want to make copperplate calligraphy, but it can also help in any task you face with a dip pen, like drawing or flowrishing. The reason to use that kind of penholders, is that they help you get a better angle with you pen, so when you apply pressure to make your lines wider, the nib end will be pulled evenly against the paper, allowing you to achieve a maximized performance of the nib flexibility.

Esta herramienta sera de mucha utilidad para los calígrafos que quieran hacer caligrafía Copperplate, pero también puede ayudar en cualquier tarea que afronten con su pluma de inmersión, como dibujar o hacer florituras. La razón por la cual utilizar este tipo de portaplumas, es que ayuda a conseguir un mejor ángulo con la pluma, para que cuando apliquen presión para ensanchar los trazos, la punta de la pluma será empujada de manera pareja contra el papel, permitiendo maximizar el desempeño de la flexibilidad de la pluma. Esperamos que disfruten este tutorial, y su nueva herramienta casera tanto como nosotros!Manos a la obra!

You can also use bamboo sticks, wooden holders or any other stick comfortable to hold and apply the same technique. And you can use a little bolt to fasten the nib holder to the stick, so you can readjust the nib angle. If you do this, you might need to do a round cut to the plate with the scissors, so it can rotate properly. Paso 9: Ahora tienen su portaplumas oblicuo, en menos de 10 minutos. También es posible utilizar varillas de bambú, de madera, o cualquier otro tipo de vara cómoda de sostener y aplicar la misma técnica. Y también se puede utilizar una tuerca pequeña para agarrar el portaplumas a la varilla, así podrán reajustar el ángulo de del plumín. Si hacen esto, podría ser necesario hacer un corte redondo a la chapa con las tijeras, para que pueda girar de manera apropiada. 20141016_155622 The above tutorial was inspired by tutorial of Erkan Tenekeci from Turkey and made by me.

                   NS1:content=" Navigation index modules | next | previous | Python » Documentation » Python HOWTOs » Regular Expression HOWTO¶ Author: A.M. Kuchling &lt;amk@amk.ca&gt; Abstract This document is an introductory tutorial to using regular expressions in Python with the re module. It provides a gentler introduction than the corresponding section in the Library Reference. Introduction¶ The re module was added in Python 1.5, and provides Perl-style regular expression patterns. Earlier versions of Python came with the regex module, which provided Emacs-style patterns. The regex module was removed completely in Python 2.5. Regular expressions (called REs, or regexes, or regex patterns) are essentially a tiny, highly specialized programming language embedded inside Python and made available through the re module. Using this little language, you specify the rules for the set of possible strings that you want to match; this set might contain English sentences, or e-mail addresses, or TeX commands, or anything you like. You can then ask questions such as “Does this string match the pattern?”, or “Is there a match for the pattern anywhere in this string?”. You can also use REs to modify a string or to split it apart in various ways. Regular expression patterns are compiled into a series of bytecodes which are then executed by a matching engine written in C. For advanced use, it may be necessary to pay careful attention to how the engine will execute a given RE, and write the RE in a certain way in order to produce bytecode that runs faster. Optimization isn’t covered in this document, because it requires that you have a good understanding of the matching engine’s internals. The regular expression language is relatively small and restricted, so not all possible string processing tasks can be done using regular expressions. There are also tasks that can be done with regular expressions, but the expressions turn out to be very complicated. In these cases, you may be better off writing Python code to do the processing; while Python code will be slower than an elaborate regular expression, it will also probably be more understandable. Simple Patterns¶ We’ll start by learning about the simplest possible regular expressions. Since regular expressions are used to operate on strings, we’ll begin with the most common task: matching characters. For a detailed explanation of the computer science underlying regular expressions (deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata), you can refer to almost any textbook on writing compilers. Matching Characters¶ Most letters and characters will simply match themselves. For example, the regular expression test will match the string test exactly. (You can enable a case-insensitive mode that would let this RE match Test or TEST as well; more about this later.) There are exceptions to this rule; some characters are special metacharacters, and don’t match themselves. Instead, they signal that some out-of-the-ordinary thing should be matched, or they affect other portions of the RE by repeating them or changing their meaning. Much of this document is devoted to discussing various metacharacters and what they do. Here’s a complete list of the metacharacters; their meanings will be discussed in the rest of this HOWTO. . ^ $ * + ? { } [ ] \ | ( ) The first metacharacters we’ll look at are [ and ]. They’re used for specifying a character class, which is a set of characters that you wish to match. Characters can be listed individually, or a range of characters can be indicated by giving two characters and separating them by a '-'. For example, [abc] will match any of the characters a, b, or c; this is the same as [a-c], which uses a range to express the same set of characters. If you wanted to match only lowercase letters, your RE would be [a-z]. Metacharacters are not active inside classes. For example, [akm$] will match any of the characters 'a', 'k', 'm', or '$'; '$' is usually a metacharacter, but inside a character class it’s stripped of its special nature. You can match the characters not listed within the class by complementing the set. This is indicated by including a '^' as the first character of the class; '^' outside a character class will simply match the '^' character. For example, [^5] will match any character except '5'. Perhaps the most important metacharacter is the backslash, \. As in Python string literals, the backslash can be followed by various characters to signal various special sequences. It’s also used to escape all the metacharacters so you can still match them in patterns; for example, if you need to match a [ or \, you can precede them with a backslash to remove their special meaning: \[ or \\. Some of the special sequences beginning with '\' represent predefined sets of characters that are often useful, such as the set of digits, the set of letters, or the set of anything that isn’t whitespace. The following predefined special sequences are a subset of those available. The equivalent classes are for byte string patterns. For a complete list of sequences and expanded class definitions for Unicode string patterns, see the last part of Regular Expression Syntax. \d Matches any decimal digit; this is equivalent to the class [0-9]. \D Matches any non-digit character; this is equivalent to the class [^0-9]. \s Matches any whitespace character; this is equivalent to the class [ \t\n\r\f\v]. \S Matches any non-whitespace character; this is equivalent to the class [^ \t\n\r\f\v]. \w Matches any alphanumeric character; this is equivalent to the class [a-zA-Z0-9_]. \W Matches any non-alphanumeric character; this is equivalent to the class [^a-zA-Z0-9_]. These sequences can be included inside a character class. For example, [\s,.] is a character class that will match any whitespace character, or ',' or '.'. The final metacharacter in this section is .. It matches anything except a newline character, and there’s an alternate mode (re.DOTALL) where it will match even a newline. '.' is often used where you want to match “any character”. Repeating Things¶ Being able to match varying sets of characters is the first thing regular expressions can do that isn’t already possible with the methods available on strings. However, if that was the only additional capability of regexes, they wouldn’t be much of an advance. Another capability is that you can specify that portions of the RE must be repeated a certain number of times. The first metacharacter for repeating things that we’ll look at is *. * doesn’t match the literal character *; instead, it specifies that the previous character can be matched zero or more times, instead of exactly once. For example, ca*t will match ct (0 a characters), cat (1 a), caaat (3 a characters), and so forth. The RE engine has various internal limitations stemming from the size of C’s int type that will prevent it from matching over 2 billion a characters; you probably don’t have enough memory to construct a string that large, so you shouldn’t run into that limit. Repetitions such as * are greedy; when repeating a RE, the matching engine will try to repeat it as many times as possible. If later portions of the pattern don’t match, the matching engine will then back up and try again with fewer repetitions. A step-by-step example will make this more obvious. Let’s consider the expression a[bcd]*b. This matches the letter 'a', zero or more letters from the class [bcd], and finally ends with a 'b'. Now imagine matching this RE against the string abcbd. Step Matched Explanation 1 a The a in the RE matches. 2 abcbd The engine matches [bcd]*, going as far as it can, which is to the end of the string. 3 Failure The engine tries to match b, but the current position is at the end of the string, so it fails. 4 abcb Back up, so that [bcd]* matches one less character. 5 Failure Try b again, but the current position is at the last character, which is a 'd'. 6 abc Back up again, so that [bcd]* is only matching bc. 6 abcb Try b again. This time the character at the current position is 'b', so it succeeds. The end of the RE has now been reached, and it has matched abcb. This demonstrates how the matching engine goes as far as it can at first, and if no match is found it will then progressively back up and retry the rest of the RE again and again. It will back up until it has tried zero matches for [bcd]*, and if that subsequently fails, the engine will conclude that the string doesn’t match the RE at all. Another repeating metacharacter is +, which matches one or more times. Pay careful attention to the difference between * and +; * matches zero or more times, so whatever’s being repeated may not be present at all, while + requires at least one occurrence. To use a similar example, ca+t will match cat (1 a), caaat (3 a‘s), but won’t match ct. There are two more repeating qualifiers. The question mark character, ?, matches either once or zero times; you can think of it as marking something as being optional. For example, home-?brew matches either homebrew or home-brew. The most complicated repeated qualifier is {m,n}, where m and n are decimal integers. This qualifier means there must be at least m repetitions, and at most n. For example, a/{1,3}b will match a/b, a//b, and a///b. It won’t match ab, which has no slashes, or a////b, which has four. You can omit either m or n; in that case, a reasonable value is assumed for the missing value. Omitting m is interpreted as a lower limit of 0, while omitting n results in an upper bound of infinity — actually, the upper bound is the 2-billion limit mentioned earlier, but that might as well be infinity. Readers of a reductionist bent may notice that the three other qualifiers can all be expressed using this notation. {0,} is the same as *, {1,} is equivalent to +, and {0,1} is the same as ?. It’s better to use *, +, or ? when you can, simply because they’re shorter and easier to read. Using Regular Expressions¶ Now that we’ve looked at some simple regular expressions, how do we actually use them in Python? The re module provides an interface to the regular expression engine, allowing you to compile REs into objects and then perform matches with them. Compiling Regular Expressions¶ Regular expressions are compiled into pattern objects, which have methods for various operations such as searching for pattern matches or performing string substitutions. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; import re &gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile('ab*') &gt;&gt;&gt; p &lt;_sre.SRE_Pattern object at 0x...&gt; re.compile() also accepts an optional flags argument, used to enable various special features and syntax variations. We’ll go over the available settings later, but for now a single example will do: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile('ab*', re.IGNORECASE) The RE is passed to re.compile() as a string. REs are handled as strings because regular expressions aren’t part of the core Python language, and no special syntax was created for expressing them. (There are applications that don’t need REs at all, so there’s no need to bloat the language specification by including them.) Instead, the re module is simply a C extension module included with Python, just like the socket or zlib modules. Putting REs in strings keeps the Python language simpler, but has one disadvantage which is the topic of the next section. The Backslash Plague¶ As stated earlier, regular expressions use the backslash character ('\') to indicate special forms or to allow special characters to be used without invoking their special meaning. This conflicts with Python’s usage of the same character for the same purpose in string literals. Let’s say you want to write a RE that matches the string \section, which might be found in a LaTeX file. To figure out what to write in the program code, start with the desired string to be matched. Next, you must escape any backslashes and other metacharacters by preceding them with a backslash, resulting in the string \\section. The resulting string that must be passed to re.compile() must be \\section. However, to express this as a Python string literal, both backslashes must be escaped again. Characters Stage \section Text string to be matched \\section Escaped backslash for re.compile() &quot;\\\\section&quot; Escaped backslashes for a string literal In short, to match a literal backslash, one has to write '\\\\' as the RE string, because the regular expression must be \\, and each backslash must be expressed as \\ inside a regular Python string literal. In REs that feature backslashes repeatedly, this leads to lots of repeated backslashes and makes the resulting strings difficult to understand. The solution is to use Python’s raw string notation for regular expressions; backslashes are not handled in any special way in a string literal prefixed with 'r', so r&quot;\n&quot; is a two-character string containing '\' and 'n', while &quot;\n&quot; is a one-character string containing a newline. Regular expressions will often be written in Python code using this raw string notation. Regular String Raw string &quot;ab*&quot; r&quot;ab*&quot; &quot;\\\\section&quot; r&quot;\\section&quot; &quot;\\w+\\s+\\1&quot; r&quot;\w+\s+\1&quot; Performing Matches¶ Once you have an object representing a compiled regular expression, what do you do with it? Pattern objects have several methods and attributes. Only the most significant ones will be covered here; consult the re docs for a complete listing. Method/Attribute Purpose match() Determine if the RE matches at the beginning of the string. search() Scan through a string, looking for any location where this RE matches. findall() Find all substrings where the RE matches, and returns them as a list. finditer() Find all substrings where the RE matches, and returns them as an iterator. match() and search() return None if no match can be found. If they’re successful, a match object instance is returned, containing information about the match: where it starts and ends, the substring it matched, and more. You can learn about this by interactively experimenting with the re module. If you have Tkinter available, you may also want to look at Tools/scripts/redemo.py, a demonstration program included with the Python distribution. It allows you to enter REs and strings, and displays whether the RE matches or fails. redemo.py can be quite useful when trying to debug a complicated RE. Phil Schwartz’s Kodos is also an interactive tool for developing and testing RE patterns. This HOWTO uses the standard Python interpreter for its examples. First, run the Python interpreter, import the re module, and compile a RE: Python 2.2.2 (#1, Feb 10 2003, 12:57:01) &gt;&gt;&gt; import re &gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile('[a-z]+') &gt;&gt;&gt; p #doctest: +ELLIPSIS &lt;_sre.SRE_Pattern object at 0x...&gt; Now, you can try matching various strings against the RE [a-z]+. An empty string shouldn’t match at all, since + means ‘one or more repetitions’. match() should return None in this case, which will cause the interpreter to print no output. You can explicitly print the result of match() to make this clear. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; p.match(&quot;&quot;) &gt;&gt;&gt; print p.match(&quot;&quot;) None Now, let’s try it on a string that it should match, such as tempo. In this case, match() will return a match object, so you should store the result in a variable for later use. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; m = p.match('tempo') &gt;&gt;&gt; m &lt;_sre.SRE_Match object at 0x...&gt; Now you can query the match object for information about the matching string. match object instances also have several methods and attributes; the most important ones are: Method/Attribute Purpose group() Return the string matched by the RE start() Return the starting position of the match end() Return the ending position of the match span() Return a tuple containing the (start, end) positions of the match Trying these methods will soon clarify their meaning: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; m.group() 'tempo' &gt;&gt;&gt; m.start(), m.end() (0, 5) &gt;&gt;&gt; m.span() (0, 5) group() returns the substring that was matched by the RE. start() and end() return the starting and ending index of the match. span() returns both start and end indexes in a single tuple. Since the match() method only checks if the RE matches at the start of a string, start() will always be zero. However, the search() method of patterns scans through the string, so the match may not start at zero in that case. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; print p.match('::: message') None &gt;&gt;&gt; m = p.search('::: message'); print m &lt;_sre.SRE_Match object at 0x...&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; m.group() 'message' &gt;&gt;&gt; m.span() (4, 11) In actual programs, the most common style is to store the match object in a variable, and then check if it was None. This usually looks like: p = re.compile( ... ) m = p.match( 'string goes here' ) if m: print 'Match found: ', m.group() else: print 'No match' Two pattern methods return all of the matches for a pattern. findall() returns a list of matching strings: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile('\d+') &gt;&gt;&gt; p.findall('12 drummers drumming, 11 pipers piping, 10 lords a-leaping') ['12', '11', '10'] findall() has to create the entire list before it can be returned as the result. The finditer() method returns a sequence of match object instances as an iterator. [1] &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; iterator = p.finditer('12 drummers drumming, 11 ... 10 ...') &gt;&gt;&gt; iterator &lt;callable-iterator object at 0x...&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; for match in iterator: ... print match.span() ... (0, 2) (22, 24) (29, 31) Module-Level Functions¶ You don’t have to create a pattern object and call its methods; the re module also provides top-level functions called match(), search(), findall(), sub(), and so forth. These functions take the same arguments as the corresponding pattern method, with the RE string added as the first argument, and still return either None or a match object instance. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; print re.match(r'From\s+', 'Fromage amk') None &gt;&gt;&gt; re.match(r'From\s+', 'From amk Thu May 14 19:12:10 1998') &lt;_sre.SRE_Match object at 0x...&gt; Under the hood, these functions simply create a pattern object for you and call the appropriate method on it. They also store the compiled object in a cache, so future calls using the same RE are faster. Should you use these module-level functions, or should you get the pattern and call its methods yourself? That choice depends on how frequently the RE will be used, and on your personal coding style. If the RE is being used at only one point in the code, then the module functions are probably more convenient. If a program contains a lot of regular expressions, or re-uses the same ones in several locations, then it might be worthwhile to collect all the definitions in one place, in a section of code that compiles all the REs ahead of time. To take an example from the standard library, here’s an extract from the deprecated xmllib module: ref = re.compile( ... ) entityref = re.compile( ... ) charref = re.compile( ... ) starttagopen = re.compile( ... ) I generally prefer to work with the compiled object, even for one-time uses, but few people will be as much of a purist about this as I am. Compilation Flags¶ Compilation flags let you modify some aspects of how regular expressions work. Flags are available in the re module under two names, a long name such as IGNORECASE and a short, one-letter form such as I. (If you’re familiar with Perl’s pattern modifiers, the one-letter forms use the same letters; the short form of re.VERBOSE is re.X, for example.) Multiple flags can be specified by bitwise OR-ing them; re.I | re.M sets both the I and M flags, for example. Here’s a table of the available flags, followed by a more detailed explanation of each one. Flag Meaning DOTALL, S Make . match any character, including newlines IGNORECASE, I Do case-insensitive matches LOCALE, L Do a locale-aware match MULTILINE, M Multi-line matching, affecting ^ and $ VERBOSE, X Enable verbose REs, which can be organized more cleanly and understandably. UNICODE, U Makes several escapes like \w, \b, \s and \d dependent on the Unicode character database. I IGNORECASE Perform case-insensitive matching; character class and literal strings will match letters by ignoring case. For example, [A-Z] will match lowercase letters, too, and Spam will match Spam, spam, or spAM. This lowercasing doesn’t take the current locale into account; it will if you also set the LOCALE flag. L LOCALE Make \w, \W, \b, and \B, dependent on the current locale. Locales are a feature of the C library intended to help in writing programs that take account of language differences. For example, if you’re processing French text, you’d want to be able to write \w+ to match words, but \w only matches the character class [A-Za-z]; it won’t match 'é' or 'ç'. If your system is configured properly and a French locale is selected, certain C functions will tell the program that 'é' should also be considered a letter. Setting the LOCALE flag when compiling a regular expression will cause the resulting compiled object to use these C functions for \w; this is slower, but also enables \w+ to match French words as you’d expect. M MULTILINE (^ and $ haven’t been explained yet; they’ll be introduced in section More Metacharacters.) Usually ^ matches only at the beginning of the string, and $ matches only at the end of the string and immediately before the newline (if any) at the end of the string. When this flag is specified, ^ matches at the beginning of the string and at the beginning of each line within the string, immediately following each newline. Similarly, the $ metacharacter matches either at the end of the string and at the end of each line (immediately preceding each newline). S DOTALL Makes the '.' special character match any character at all, including a newline; without this flag, '.' will match anything except a newline. U UNICODE Make \w, \W, \b, \B, \d, \D, \s and \S dependent on the Unicode character properties database. X VERBOSE This flag allows you to write regular expressions that are more readable by granting you more flexibility in how you can format them. When this flag has been specified, whitespace within the RE string is ignored, except when the whitespace is in a character class or preceded by an unescaped backslash; this lets you organize and indent the RE more clearly. This flag also lets you put comments within a RE that will be ignored by the engine; comments are marked by a '#' that’s neither in a character class or preceded by an unescaped backslash. For example, here’s a RE that uses re.VERBOSE; see how much easier it is to read? charref = re.compile(r&quot;&quot;&quot; &amp;[#] # Start of a numeric entity reference ( 0[0-7]+ # Octal form | [0-9]+ # Decimal form | x[0-9a-fA-F]+ # Hexadecimal form ) ; # Trailing semicolon &quot;&quot;&quot;, re.VERBOSE) Without the verbose setting, the RE would look like this: charref = re.compile(&quot;&amp;#(0[0-7]+&quot; &quot;|[0-9]+&quot; &quot;|x[0-9a-fA-F]+);&quot;) In the above example, Python’s automatic concatenation of string literals has been used to break up the RE into smaller pieces, but it’s still more difficult to understand than the version using re.VERBOSE. More Pattern Power¶ So far we’ve only covered a part of the features of regular expressions. In this section, we’ll cover some new metacharacters, and how to use groups to retrieve portions of the text that was matched. More Metacharacters¶ There are some metacharacters that we haven’t covered yet. Most of them will be covered in this section. Some of the remaining metacharacters to be discussed are zero-width assertions. They don’t cause the engine to advance through the string; instead, they consume no characters at all, and simply succeed or fail. For example, \b is an assertion that the current position is located at a word boundary; the position isn’t changed by the \b at all. This means that zero-width assertions should never be repeated, because if they match once at a given location, they can obviously be matched an infinite number of times. | Alternation, or the “or” operator. If A and B are regular expressions, A|B will match any string that matches either A or B. | has very low precedence in order to make it work reasonably when you’re alternating multi-character strings. Crow|Servo will match either Crow or Servo, not Cro, a 'w' or an 'S', and ervo. To match a literal '|', use \|, or enclose it inside a character class, as in [|]. ^ Matches at the beginning of lines. Unless the MULTILINE flag has been set, this will only match at the beginning of the string. In MULTILINE mode, this also matches immediately after each newline within the string. For example, if you wish to match the word From only at the beginning of a line, the RE to use is ^From. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; print re.search('^From', 'From Here to Eternity') &lt;_sre.SRE_Match object at 0x...&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; print re.search('^From', 'Reciting From Memory') None $ Matches at the end of a line, which is defined as either the end of the string, or any location followed by a newline character. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; print re.search('}$', '{block}') &lt;_sre.SRE_Match object at 0x...&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; print re.search('}$', '{block} ') None &gt;&gt;&gt; print re.search('}$', '{block}\n') &lt;_sre.SRE_Match object at 0x...&gt; To match a literal '$', use \$ or enclose it inside a character class, as in [$]. \A Matches only at the start of the string. When not in MULTILINE mode, \A and ^ are effectively the same. In MULTILINE mode, they’re different: \A still matches only at the beginning of the string, but ^ may match at any location inside the string that follows a newline character. \Z Matches only at the end of the string. \b Word boundary. This is a zero-width assertion that matches only at the beginning or end of a word. A word is defined as a sequence of alphanumeric characters, so the end of a word is indicated by whitespace or a non-alphanumeric character. The following example matches class only when it’s a complete word; it won’t match when it’s contained inside another word. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile(r'\bclass\b') &gt;&gt;&gt; print p.search('no class at all') &lt;_sre.SRE_Match object at 0x...&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; print p.search('the declassified algorithm') None &gt;&gt;&gt; print p.search('one subclass is') None There are two subtleties you should remember when using this special sequence. First, this is the worst collision between Python’s string literals and regular expression sequences. In Python’s string literals, \b is the backspace character, ASCII value 8. If you’re not using raw strings, then Python will convert the \b to a backspace, and your RE won’t match as you expect it to. The following example looks the same as our previous RE, but omits the 'r' in front of the RE string. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile('\bclass\b') &gt;&gt;&gt; print p.search('no class at all') None &gt;&gt;&gt; print p.search('\b' + 'class' + '\b') &lt;_sre.SRE_Match object at 0x...&gt; Second, inside a character class, where there’s no use for this assertion, \b represents the backspace character, for compatibility with Python’s string literals. \B Another zero-width assertion, this is the opposite of \b, only matching when the current position is not at a word boundary. Grouping¶ Frequently you need to obtain more information than just whether the RE matched or not. Regular expressions are often used to dissect strings by writing a RE divided into several subgroups which match different components of interest. For example, an RFC-822 header line is divided into a header name and a value, separated by a ':', like this: From: author@example.com User-Agent: Thunderbird 1.5.0.9 (X11/20061227) MIME-Version: 1.0 To: editor@example.com This can be handled by writing a regular expression which matches an entire header line, and has one group which matches the header name, and another group which matches the header’s value. Groups are marked by the '(', ')' metacharacters. '(' and ')' have much the same meaning as they do in mathematical expressions; they group together the expressions contained inside them, and you can repeat the contents of a group with a repeating qualifier, such as *, +, ?, or {m,n}. For example, (ab)* will match zero or more repetitions of ab. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile('(ab)*') &gt;&gt;&gt; print p.match('ababababab').span() (0, 10) Groups indicated with '(', ')' also capture the starting and ending index of the text that they match; this can be retrieved by passing an argument to group(), start(), end(), and span(). Groups are numbered starting with 0. Group 0 is always present; it’s the whole RE, so match object methods all have group 0 as their default argument. Later we’ll see how to express groups that don’t capture the span of text that they match. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile('(a)b') &gt;&gt;&gt; m = p.match('ab') &gt;&gt;&gt; m.group() 'ab' &gt;&gt;&gt; m.group(0) 'ab' Subgroups are numbered from left to right, from 1 upward. Groups can be nested; to determine the number, just count the opening parenthesis characters, going from left to right. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile('(a(b)c)d') &gt;&gt;&gt; m = p.match('abcd') &gt;&gt;&gt; m.group(0) 'abcd' &gt;&gt;&gt; m.group(1) 'abc' &gt;&gt;&gt; m.group(2) 'b' group() can be passed multiple group numbers at a time, in which case it will return a tuple containing the corresponding values for those groups. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; m.group(2,1,2) ('b', 'abc', 'b') The groups() method returns a tuple containing the strings for all the subgroups, from 1 up to however many there are. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; m.groups() ('abc', 'b') Backreferences in a pattern allow you to specify that the contents of an earlier capturing group must also be found at the current location in the string. For example, \1 will succeed if the exact contents of group 1 can be found at the current position, and fails otherwise. Remember that Python’s string literals also use a backslash followed by numbers to allow including arbitrary characters in a string, so be sure to use a raw string when incorporating backreferences in a RE. For example, the following RE detects doubled words in a string. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile(r'(\b\w+)\s+\1') &gt;&gt;&gt; p.search('Paris in the the spring').group() 'the the' Backreferences like this aren’t often useful for just searching through a string — there are few text formats which repeat data in this way — but you’ll soon find out that they’re very useful when performing string substitutions. Non-capturing and Named Groups¶ Elaborate REs may use many groups, both to capture substrings of interest, and to group and structure the RE itself. In complex REs, it becomes difficult to keep track of the group numbers. There are two features which help with this problem. Both of them use a common syntax for regular expression extensions, so we’ll look at that first. Perl 5 added several additional features to standard regular expressions, and the Python re module supports most of them. It would have been difficult to choose new single-keystroke metacharacters or new special sequences beginning with \ to represent the new features without making Perl’s regular expressions confusingly different from standard REs. If you chose &amp; as a new metacharacter, for example, old expressions would be assuming that &amp; was a regular character and wouldn’t have escaped it by writing \&amp; or [&amp;]. The solution chosen by the Perl developers was to use (?...) as the extension syntax. ? immediately after a parenthesis was a syntax error because the ? would have nothing to repeat, so this didn’t introduce any compatibility problems. The characters immediately after the ? indicate what extension is being used, so (?=foo) is one thing (a positive lookahead assertion) and (?:foo) is something else (a non-capturing group containing the subexpression foo). Python adds an extension syntax to Perl’s extension syntax. If the first character after the question mark is a P, you know that it’s an extension that’s specific to Python. Currently there are two such extensions: (?P&lt;name&gt;...) defines a named group, and (?P=name) is a backreference to a named group. If future versions of Perl 5 add similar features using a different syntax, the re module will be changed to support the new syntax, while preserving the Python-specific syntax for compatibility’s sake. Now that we’ve looked at the general extension syntax, we can return to the features that simplify working with groups in complex REs. Since groups are numbered from left to right and a complex expression may use many groups, it can become difficult to keep track of the correct numbering. Modifying such a complex RE is annoying, too: insert a new group near the beginning and you change the numbers of everything that follows it. Sometimes you’ll want to use a group to collect a part of a regular expression, but aren’t interested in retrieving the group’s contents. You can make this fact explicit by using a non-capturing group: (?:...), where you can replace the ... with any other regular expression. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; m = re.match(&quot;([abc])+&quot;, &quot;abc&quot;) &gt;&gt;&gt; m.groups() ('c',) &gt;&gt;&gt; m = re.match(&quot;(?:[abc])+&quot;, &quot;abc&quot;) &gt;&gt;&gt; m.groups() () Except for the fact that you can’t retrieve the contents of what the group matched, a non-capturing group behaves exactly the same as a capturing group; you can put anything inside it, repeat it with a repetition metacharacter such as *, and nest it within other groups (capturing or non-capturing). (?:...) is particularly useful when modifying an existing pattern, since you can add new groups without changing how all the other groups are numbered. It should be mentioned that there’s no performance difference in searching between capturing and non-capturing groups; neither form is any faster than the other. A more significant feature is named groups: instead of referring to them by numbers, groups can be referenced by a name. The syntax for a named group is one of the Python-specific extensions: (?P&lt;name&gt;...). name is, obviously, the name of the group. Named groups also behave exactly like capturing groups, and additionally associate a name with a group. The match object methods that deal with capturing groups all accept either integers that refer to the group by number or strings that contain the desired group’s name. Named groups are still given numbers, so you can retrieve information about a group in two ways: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile(r'(?P&lt;word&gt;\b\w+\b)') &gt;&gt;&gt; m = p.search( '(((( Lots of punctuation )))' ) &gt;&gt;&gt; m.group('word') 'Lots' &gt;&gt;&gt; m.group(1) 'Lots' Named groups are handy because they let you use easily-remembered names, instead of having to remember numbers. Here’s an example RE from the imaplib module: InternalDate = re.compile(r'INTERNALDATE &quot;' r'(?P&lt;day&gt;[ 123][0-9])-(?P&lt;mon&gt;[A-Z][a-z][a-z])-' r'(?P&lt;year&gt;[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9])' r' (?P&lt;hour&gt;[0-9][0-9]):(?P&lt;min&gt;[0-9][0-9]):(?P&lt;sec&gt;[0-9][0-9])' r' (?P&lt;zonen&gt;[-+])(?P&lt;zoneh&gt;[0-9][0-9])(?P&lt;zonem&gt;[0-9][0-9])' r'&quot;') It’s obviously much easier to retrieve m.group('zonem'), instead of having to remember to retrieve group 9. The syntax for backreferences in an expression such as (...)\1 refers to the number of the group. There’s naturally a variant that uses the group name instead of the number. This is another Python extension: (?P=name) indicates that the contents of the group called name should again be matched at the current point. The regular expression for finding doubled words, (\b\w+)\s+\1 can also be written as (?P&lt;word&gt;\b\w+)\s+(?P=word): &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile(r'(?P&lt;word&gt;\b\w+)\s+(?P=word)') &gt;&gt;&gt; p.search('Paris in the the spring').group() 'the the' Lookahead Assertions¶ Another zero-width assertion is the lookahead assertion. Lookahead assertions are available in both positive and negative form, and look like this: (?=...) Positive lookahead assertion. This succeeds if the contained regular expression, represented here by ..., successfully matches at the current location, and fails otherwise. But, once the contained expression has been tried, the matching engine doesn’t advance at all; the rest of the pattern is tried right where the assertion started. (?!...) Negative lookahead assertion. This is the opposite of the positive assertion; it succeeds if the contained expression doesn’t match at the current position in the string. To make this concrete, let’s look at a case where a lookahead is useful. Consider a simple pattern to match a filename and split it apart into a base name and an extension, separated by a .. For example, in news.rc, news is the base name, and rc is the filename’s extension. The pattern to match this is quite simple: .*[.].*$ Notice that the . needs to be treated specially because it’s a metacharacter; I’ve put it inside a character class. Also notice the trailing $; this is added to ensure that all the rest of the string must be included in the extension. This regular expression matches foo.bar and autoexec.bat and sendmail.cf and printers.conf. Now, consider complicating the problem a bit; what if you want to match filenames where the extension is not bat? Some incorrect attempts: .*[.][^b].*$ The first attempt above tries to exclude bat by requiring that the first character of the extension is not a b. This is wrong, because the pattern also doesn’t match foo.bar. .*[.]([^b]..|.[^a].|..[^t])$ The expression gets messier when you try to patch up the first solution by requiring one of the following cases to match: the first character of the extension isn’t b; the second character isn’t a; or the third character isn’t t. This accepts foo.bar and rejects autoexec.bat, but it requires a three-letter extension and won’t accept a filename with a two-letter extension such as sendmail.cf. We’ll complicate the pattern again in an effort to fix it. .*[.]([^b].?.?|.[^a]?.?|..?[^t]?)$ In the third attempt, the second and third letters are all made optional in order to allow matching extensions shorter than three characters, such as sendmail.cf. The pattern’s getting really complicated now, which makes it hard to read and understand. Worse, if the problem changes and you want to exclude both bat and exe as extensions, the pattern would get even more complicated and confusing. A negative lookahead cuts through all this confusion: .*[.](?!bat$)[^.]*$ The negative lookahead means: if the expression bat doesn’t match at this point, try the rest of the pattern; if bat$ does match, the whole pattern will fail. The trailing $ is required to ensure that something like sample.batch, where the extension only starts with bat, will be allowed. The [^.]* makes sure that the pattern works when there are multiple dots in the filename. Excluding another filename extension is now easy; simply add it as an alternative inside the assertion. The following pattern excludes filenames that end in either bat or exe: .*[.](?!bat$|exe$)[^.]*$ Modifying Strings¶ Up to this point, we’ve simply performed searches against a static string. Regular expressions are also commonly used to modify strings in various ways, using the following pattern methods: Method/Attribute Purpose split() Split the string into a list, splitting it wherever the RE matches sub() Find all substrings where the RE matches, and replace them with a different string subn() Does the same thing as sub(), but returns the new string and the number of replacements Splitting Strings¶ The split() method of a pattern splits a string apart wherever the RE matches, returning a list of the pieces. It’s similar to the split() method of strings but provides much more generality in the delimiters that you can split by; split() only supports splitting by whitespace or by a fixed string. As you’d expect, there’s a module-level re.split() function, too. .split(string[, maxsplit=0]) Split string by the matches of the regular expression. If capturing parentheses are used in the RE, then their contents will also be returned as part of the resulting list. If maxsplit is nonzero, at most maxsplit splits are performed. You can limit the number of splits made, by passing a value for maxsplit. When maxsplit is nonzero, at most maxsplit splits will be made, and the remainder of the string is returned as the final element of the list. In the following example, the delimiter is any sequence of non-alphanumeric characters. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile(r'\W+') &gt;&gt;&gt; p.split('This is a test, short and sweet, of split().') ['This', 'is', 'a', 'test', 'short', 'and', 'sweet', 'of', 'split', ''] &gt;&gt;&gt; p.split('This is a test, short and sweet, of split().', 3) ['This', 'is', 'a', 'test, short and sweet, of split().'] Sometimes you’re not only interested in what the text between delimiters is, but also need to know what the delimiter was. If capturing parentheses are used in the RE, then their values are also returned as part of the list. Compare the following calls: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile(r'\W+') &gt;&gt;&gt; p2 = re.compile(r'(\W+)') &gt;&gt;&gt; p.split('This... is a test.') ['This', 'is', 'a', 'test', ''] &gt;&gt;&gt; p2.split('This... is a test.') ['This', '... ', 'is', ' ', 'a', ' ', 'test', '.', ''] The module-level function re.split() adds the RE to be used as the first argument, but is otherwise the same. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; re.split('[\W]+', 'Words, words, words.') ['Words', 'words', 'words', ''] &gt;&gt;&gt; re.split('([\W]+)', 'Words, words, words.') ['Words', ', ', 'words', ', ', 'words', '.', ''] &gt;&gt;&gt; re.split('[\W]+', 'Words, words, words.', 1) ['Words', 'words, words.'] Search and Replace¶ Another common task is to find all the matches for a pattern, and replace them with a different string. The sub() method takes a replacement value, which can be either a string or a function, and the string to be processed. .sub(replacement, string[, count=0]) Returns the string obtained by replacing the leftmost non-overlapping occurrences of the RE in string by the replacement replacement. If the pattern isn’t found, string is returned unchanged. The optional argument count is the maximum number of pattern occurrences to be replaced; count must be a non-negative integer. The default value of 0 means to replace all occurrences. Here’s a simple example of using the sub() method. It replaces colour names with the word colour: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile('(blue|white|red)') &gt;&gt;&gt; p.sub('colour', 'blue socks and red shoes') 'colour socks and colour shoes' &gt;&gt;&gt; p.sub('colour', 'blue socks and red shoes', count=1) 'colour socks and red shoes' The subn() method does the same work, but returns a 2-tuple containing the new string value and the number of replacements that were performed: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile('(blue|white|red)') &gt;&gt;&gt; p.subn('colour', 'blue socks and red shoes') ('colour socks and colour shoes', 2) &gt;&gt;&gt; p.subn('colour', 'no colours at all') ('no colours at all', 0) Empty matches are replaced only when they’re not adjacent to a previous match. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile('x*') &gt;&gt;&gt; p.sub('-', 'abxd') '-a-b-d-' If replacement is a string, any backslash escapes in it are processed. That is, \n is converted to a single newline character, \r is converted to a carriage return, and so forth. Unknown escapes such as \j are left alone. Backreferences, such as \6, are replaced with the substring matched by the corresponding group in the RE. This lets you incorporate portions of the original text in the resulting replacement string. This example matches the word section followed by a string enclosed in {, }, and changes section to subsection: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile('section{ ( [^}]* ) }', re.VERBOSE) &gt;&gt;&gt; p.sub(r'subsection{\1}','section{First} section{second}') 'subsection{First} subsection{second}' There’s also a syntax for referring to named groups as defined by the (?P&lt;name&gt;...) syntax. \g&lt;name&gt; will use the substring matched by the group named name, and \g&lt;number&gt; uses the corresponding group number. \g&lt;2&gt; is therefore equivalent to \2, but isn’t ambiguous in a replacement string such as \g&lt;2&gt;0. (\20 would be interpreted as a reference to group 20, not a reference to group 2 followed by the literal character '0'.) The following substitutions are all equivalent, but use all three variations of the replacement string. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile('section{ (?P&lt;name&gt; [^}]* ) }', re.VERBOSE) &gt;&gt;&gt; p.sub(r'subsection{\1}','section{First}') 'subsection{First}' &gt;&gt;&gt; p.sub(r'subsection{\g&lt;1&gt;}','section{First}') 'subsection{First}' &gt;&gt;&gt; p.sub(r'subsection{\g&lt;name&gt;}','section{First}') 'subsection{First}' replacement can also be a function, which gives you even more control. If replacement is a function, the function is called for every non-overlapping occurrence of pattern. On each call, the function is passed a match object argument for the match and can use this information to compute the desired replacement string and return it. In the following example, the replacement function translates decimals into hexadecimal: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; def hexrepl(match): ... &quot;Return the hex string for a decimal number&quot; ... value = int(match.group()) ... return hex(value) ... &gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile(r'\d+') &gt;&gt;&gt; p.sub(hexrepl, 'Call 65490 for printing, 49152 for user code.') 'Call 0xffd2 for printing, 0xc000 for user code.' When using the module-level re.sub() function, the pattern is passed as the first argument. The pattern may be provided as an object or as a string; if you need to specify regular expression flags, you must either use a pattern object as the first parameter, or use embedded modifiers in the pattern string, e.g. sub(&quot;(?i)b+&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;bbbb BBBB&quot;) returns 'x x'. Common Problems¶ Regular expressions are a powerful tool for some applications, but in some ways their behaviour isn’t intuitive and at times they don’t behave the way you may expect them to. This section will point out some of the most common pitfalls. Use String Methods¶ Sometimes using the re module is a mistake. If you’re matching a fixed string, or a single character class, and you’re not using any re features such as the IGNORECASE flag, then the full power of regular expressions may not be required. Strings have several methods for performing operations with fixed strings and they’re usually much faster, because the implementation is a single small C loop that’s been optimized for the purpose, instead of the large, more generalized regular expression engine. One example might be replacing a single fixed string with another one; for example, you might replace word with deed. re.sub() seems like the function to use for this, but consider the replace() method. Note that replace() will also replace word inside words, turning swordfish into sdeedfish, but the naive RE word would have done that, too. (To avoid performing the substitution on parts of words, the pattern would have to be \bword\b, in order to require that word have a word boundary on either side. This takes the job beyond replace()‘s abilities.) Another common task is deleting every occurrence of a single character from a string or replacing it with another single character. You might do this with something like re.sub('\n', ' ', S), but translate() is capable of doing both tasks and will be faster than any regular expression operation can be. In short, before turning to the re module, consider whether your problem can be solved with a faster and simpler string method. match() versus search()¶ The match() function only checks if the RE matches at the beginning of the string while search() will scan forward through the string for a match. It’s important to keep this distinction in mind. Remember, match() will only report a successful match which will start at 0; if the match wouldn’t start at zero, match() will not report it. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; print re.match('super', 'superstition').span() (0, 5) &gt;&gt;&gt; print re.match('super', 'insuperable') None On the other hand, search() will scan forward through the string, reporting the first match it finds. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; print re.search('super', 'superstition').span() (0, 5) &gt;&gt;&gt; print re.search('super', 'insuperable').span() (2, 7) Sometimes you’ll be tempted to keep using re.match(), and just add .* to the front of your RE. Resist this temptation and use re.search() instead. The regular expression compiler does some analysis of REs in order to speed up the process of looking for a match. One such analysis figures out what the first character of a match must be; for example, a pattern starting with Crow must match starting with a 'C'. The analysis lets the engine quickly scan through the string looking for the starting character, only trying the full match if a 'C' is found. Adding .* defeats this optimization, requiring scanning to the end of the string and then backtracking to find a match for the rest of the RE. Use re.search() instead. Greedy versus Non-Greedy¶ When repeating a regular expression, as in a*, the resulting action is to consume as much of the pattern as possible. This fact often bites you when you’re trying to match a pair of balanced delimiters, such as the angle brackets surrounding an HTML tag. The naive pattern for matching a single HTML tag doesn’t work because of the greedy nature of .*. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; s = '&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Title&lt;/title&gt;' &gt;&gt;&gt; len(s) 32 &gt;&gt;&gt; print re.match('&lt;.*&gt;', s).span() (0, 32) &gt;&gt;&gt; print re.match('&lt;.*&gt;', s).group() &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Title&lt;/title&gt; The RE matches the '&lt;' in &lt;html&gt;, and the .* consumes the rest of the string. There’s still more left in the RE, though, and the &gt; can’t match at the end of the string, so the regular expression engine has to backtrack character by character until it finds a match for the &gt;. The final match extends from the '&lt;' in &lt;html&gt; to the '&gt;' in &lt;/title&gt;, which isn’t what you want. In this case, the solution is to use the non-greedy qualifiers *?, +?, ??, or {m,n}?, which match as little text as possible. In the above example, the '&gt;' is tried immediately after the first '&lt;' matches, and when it fails, the engine advances a character at a time, retrying the '&gt;' at every step. This produces just the right result: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; print re.match('&lt;.*?&gt;', s).group() &lt;html&gt; (Note that parsing HTML or XML with regular expressions is painful. Quick-and-dirty patterns will handle common cases, but HTML and XML have special cases that will break the obvious regular expression; by the time you’ve written a regular expression that handles all of the possible cases, the patterns will be very complicated. Use an HTML or XML parser module for such tasks.) Using re.VERBOSE¶ By now you’ve probably noticed that regular expressions are a very compact notation, but they’re not terribly readable. REs of moderate complexity can become lengthy collections of backslashes, parentheses, and metacharacters, making them difficult to read and understand. For such REs, specifying the re.VERBOSE flag when compiling the regular expression can be helpful, because it allows you to format the regular expression more clearly. The re.VERBOSE flag has several effects. Whitespace in the regular expression that isn’t inside a character class is ignored. This means that an expression such as dog | cat is equivalent to the less readable dog|cat, but [a b] will still match the characters 'a', 'b', or a space. In addition, you can also put comments inside a RE; comments extend from a # character to the next newline. When used with triple-quoted strings, this enables REs to be formatted more neatly: pat = re.compile(r&quot;&quot;&quot; \s* # Skip leading whitespace (?P&lt;header&gt;[^:]+) # Header name \s* : # Whitespace, and a colon (?P&lt;value&gt;.*?) # The header's value -- *? used to # lose the following trailing whitespace \s*$ # Trailing whitespace to end-of-line &quot;&quot;&quot;, re.VERBOSE) This is far more readable than: pat = re.compile(r&quot;\s*(?P&lt;header&gt;[^:]+)\s*:(?P&lt;value&gt;.*?)\s*$&quot;) Feedback¶ Regular expressions are a complicated topic. Did this document help you understand them? Were there parts that were unclear, or Problems you encountered that weren’t covered here? If so, please send suggestions for improvements to the author. The most complete book on regular expressions is almost certainly Jeffrey Friedl’s Mastering Regular Expressions, published by O’Reilly. Unfortunately, it exclusively concentrates on Perl and Java’s flavours of regular expressions, and doesn’t contain any Python material at all, so it won’t be useful as a reference for programming in Python. (The first edition covered Python’s now-removed regex module, which won’t help you much.) Consider checking it out from your library. Footnotes [1] Introduced in Python 2.2.2.

Since I’m trying to make a habit of narrating my first encounters with various tools, here’s a short novel of 0 through cloning a repo. Starting Out Google hands me the intro doc right away. I noticed this when researcing my config management comparison post as well – Googling for a given topic results in more useful docs and less marketing with Ansible than CFEngine, Puppet, or Chef. I install Ansible with yaourt -S ansible. This installs it: $ ansible --version ansible 1.9.1 configured module search path = None I wonder what that search path info is for... I’m sure the docs will tell me when I need it. So, I need an /etc/ansible/hosts First, I need a host to put in it. Since I use DigitalOcean for my VPS and have some free credit lying around from the GitHub Education Pack, I go spin up a $5/month droplet to play with. I make sure to check the box to add my SSH key, and add the key to my agent locally, to avoid hassles in the future. Write /etc/ansible/hosts I grab the droplet’s IP address from the digitalocean console, then I drop it into /etc/ansible/hosts. I wonder for a minute whether there’s any way to alias the host or generally refer to it by something more friendly than an IP address, thn I remember that there ways of grouping hosts in order to address them and the tutorial gets to that later on. Oh yeah, and I did that thing I always do and forgot to open the file in /etc/ with sudo, hitting that familiar error: E45: 'readonly' option is set (add ! to override) The fix is to write with: :w !sudo tee % This says “write the file; shell out to sudo tee, give it the contents of the whole file (%) as an argument” (thanks stackoverflow!) Ping the Host(s) Next tutorial step is ansible all -m ping. I fumbled the typing on the first try, and learned something from the error: $ ansible all -m png 162.243.134.126 | FAILED =&gt; module png not found in configured module paths This tells me that the -m ping is actually running a module on it. I took a look at the source to see if the ping module is easy to find to read, but I’m not familiar enough to know exactly where to find it. A bit more clicking around suggests it’s probably somewhere in here. Oh hey, I found it! It’s only in like the second place I checked. It’s short and easy to read. The docstring is pretty interesting; the C(path) syntax appears to be some kind of cross-referencing directive. So we make a module with some boilerplate in it, import the basic utils, then blindly call main(). This is totally something I could write if I needed to. So, when I spell ping correctly, I get: $ ansible all -m ping The authenticity of host '162.243.134.126 (162.243.134.126)' can't be established. ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:pMoI7FvPgBiFqosItd7rmlHABpiKWBToM/asCOgbAh8. Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? and then tell it yes. Cool story, standard SSH stuff. And then... $ ansible all -m ping 162.243.134.126 | FAILED =&gt; SSH Error: Permission denied (publickey,password). while connecting to 162.243.134.126:22 It is sometimes useful to re-run the command using -vvvv, which prints SSH debug output to help diagnose the issue. Well okay then, I guess that makes sense considering that the user on the remote box is root and locally I’m edunham. Let’s see... I could totally look this up, but let’s blindly guess that the -u flag is what’s necessary...: $ ansible all -u root -m ping 162.243.134.126 | success &gt;&gt; { &quot;changed&quot;: false, &quot;ping&quot;: &quot;pong&quot; } Ah-ha, it behaves like a proper little Unix utility with guessable flags! Good social engineering tactic there, Ansible, making me feel all clever... Let’s install a thing! With this initial success, I’m going to deviate from the tutorial a bit and see how Ansible handles trying to install a package from source. I’ve decided to build a mockup of play.rust-lang.org, since it’s one of the SPOFs that’s scaring me the worst about Rust’s infrastructure at the moment. It’s an Arch box that hasn’t been updated in a while, running Arch because this tool called playpen comes packaged for Arch but you have to biuld it yourself on Ubuntu. (Yes, the devs were doing the ops work before I got there). So, I want to install playpen from source. First, I guess, I should probably install Git from the package manager, so that Ansible can clone playpen. The tutorial’s next step is to run an echo command, so I guess I could repurpose it into an apt-get command, but that seems very wrong. Let’s see what’s next... The inventory section of the intro comes next, and it explains how to name groups of hosts. Turns out that happens in /etc/ansible/hosts as well... I’d really rather not keep the metadata on how things are grouped up over in /etc/. I feel like it might be better to put the inventory in the config repo... and stackoverflow points out that one can pass the -i flag to specify a custom inventory location. The best practices doc (thank you, Ansible, for having a best practices doc that’s actually easy to find) has a section on content organization, which on the one hand doesn’t say much about keeping a copy of the hosts file, but on the other hand reassures me by not forbidding it either. I’m just a little bit worried about keeping the grouping metadata of the hosts file from getting lost, since running commands on the correct hosts is a core feature of any good CM tool. So, change workflow a little: $ cp /etc/ansible/hosts ~/repos/toy-ansible/hosts $ cat hosts [server] play ansible_ssh_host=162.243.134.126 $ ansible play -u root -m ping -i hosts play | success &gt;&gt; { &quot;changed&quot;: false, &quot;ping&quot;: &quot;pong&quot; } Okay, now I can keep this metadata in the repository if I want to. Still not totally sure what best practices will be here for my particular use case; maybe using DNS; maybe storing the exact IPs in a file that never gets committed but leaving hosts as a skeleton to document what goes where if anyone else tries to set up a copy; maybe publishing it and just trusting AWS firewall to do what i tell it to. Because if ansible gets run from or via the bastion, I can leave SSH access just as locked down as it’s always been. So. One PR to fix confusing wording later, I’m back to figuring out the next file to stick in my repo to explain to the Ansible world that this “play” host needs to have Git installed on it. ...okay, that’s a lot of /etc/ansible/whatever files and dirs in the tutorial. Maybe I’m supposed to be keeping all of /etc/ansible in Git, rather than my arbitrary repos place? Maybe there’s some prefix in an environment variable that I can set so I odn’t have to keep passing -i every time? Okay, tutorial. All this stuff about managing many hosts is cool and I’ll come back to it later, but can we get on with the single host case already? And no, tutorial, I do NOT want to learn about ad-hoc commands before playbooks. Okay, you can shut everything down on Christmas, but that will make people Quite Unhappy. I want to live in a world where special snowflakes and one-offs are always a bad thing, so I’m jumping straight to the playbooks section. Playbooks Ok, so I’m just really bad at recognizing YAML. I claimed elsewhere that I didn’t recognize the syntax of Ansible playbooks, which is true, but that’s my fault and not theirs. Their sample playbook makes sense! Let’s try writing something of my own... oh wait, I don’t know what file extension nor location it belongs with. Fine, guess I’ve gotta actually keep reading the docs for awhile. The Next Day So, I come back and find the playbooks tutorial conveniently open in a tab. Cool, that’s what to put in a playbook... but what do I call it? Dig around for best practices, don’t find any, file another bug, call it server.yml because who cares. Guess from the sample playbook how to translate from Yum to Apt. install Git We’re going to jump right into trying to install Playpen from source, because I find I learn the most from doing things wrong. First, I’ll try to install Git. From the tutorial, I’m guessing this should work: --- - hosts: play remote_user: root tasks: - name: install Git apt: pkg=git state=latest Now, the right thing to do here would be see whether it runs, but I’m going to do the wrong thing and try to figure out how to install Playpen from source as well. Let’s just pretend that changing too many things at once is a test of the quality of those inevitable error messages I’m going to induce. shave a yak and install known_hosts There’s a post about installing redis on the Google group, and the guy who wrote most of Ansible chimes in with some advice on best practices (though the thread is from 2013, so it may be totally obsolete by now). Looking for the right way to do a git clone through Ansible reveals that it sometimes gets stuck, usually when known_hosts is missing. Looks like I get to learn how to put a file in place, before learning to git clone. I’m not totally sure if the boilerplate about ansible_ssh_user that I’m copying is actually going to accomplish my goal, but we’ll see when I run it. Since I’m edunham on the machine where I’m running Ansible and root on the remote system, it’ll be obvious to which user that variable referred. Now my server.yml looks like this: --- - hosts: play remote_user: root tasks: - name: install Git apt: pkg=git state=latest - name: Install known_hosts file copy: src=known_hosts dest=/home/${ansible_ssh_user}/.ssh/known_hosts owner=${ansible_ssh_user} group=${ansible_ssh_user} I then moved my laptop’s ~/.ssh/known_hosts to a backup location, tried to pull from github, added the key, and copied the now-much-shorter ~/.ssh/known_hosts into my Ansible repo. Trial and error and error After putting my local backup back into place so my laptop knows more hosts than just GitHub, it’s time to see whether Ansible can apply that playbook: $ ansible-playbook server.yml PLAY [play] ******************************************************************* skipping: no hosts matched PLAY RECAP ******************************************************************** Huh, I clearly did something wrong... Oh, that’s right, it wouldn’t know which host play is because I moved the ansible hosts file into the repo!: $ ansible-playbook -i hosts server.yml PLAY [play] ******************************************************************* GATHERING FACTS *************************************************************** fatal: [play] =&gt; SSH Error: Permission denied (publickey,password). while connecting to 162.243.134.126:22 It is sometimes useful to re-run the command using -vvvv, which prints SSH debug output to help diagnose the issue. TASK: [install Git] *********************************************************** FATAL: no hosts matched or all hosts have already failed -- aborting PLAY RECAP ******************************************************************** to retry, use: --limit @/home/edunham/server.retry play : ok=0 changed=0 unreachable=1 failed=0 And that would be a failure to add the relevant ssh key after reboot. I add the ssh key to my agent, and this time it works: $ ansible-playbook -i hosts server.yml PLAY [play] ******************************************************************* GATHERING FACTS *************************************************************** ok: [play] TASK: [install Git] *********************************************************** changed: [play] TASK: [Install known_hosts file] ********************************************** failed: [play] =&gt; {&quot;checksum&quot;: &quot;926e119d8b84c44f4790c47436967ada72e05ba3&quot;, &quot;failed&quot;: true} msg: Destination directory /home/${ansible_ssh_user}/.ssh does not exist FATAL: all hosts have already failed -- aborting PLAY RECAP ******************************************************************** to retry, use: --limit @/home/edunham/server.retry play : ok=2 changed=1 unreachable=0 failed=1 Okay, the ansible_ssh_user stuff was indeed screwed up. If I Google a bit more, I find that I actually skipped something importat in the inventory intro: setting the user for the host. So I add ansible_ssh_user=root to the hosts file, and try again... and it fails again. Even when I substitute root for ${ansible_ssh_user} in the playbook, it fails the same way. Looks like it’s not automatically creating the directory for me. Create a directory So, I get to make .ssh by hand. Cool story. So now that task looks like this: - name: Install known_hosts file file: path=/home/${ansible_ssh_user}/.ssh/ state=directory owner=${ansible_ssh_user} group=${ansible_ssh_user} copy: src=known_hosts dest=/home/${ansible_ssh_user}/.ssh/known_hosts owner=${ansible_ssh_user} group=${ansible_ssh_user} for which I’m rewarded with the error ERROR: multiple actions specified in task: 'file' and 'Install known_hosts file'. So I give a separate name to each action, try again, and get a new error: failed: [play] =&gt; {&quot;failed&quot;: true, &quot;gid&quot;: 0, &quot;group&quot;: &quot;root&quot;, &quot;mode&quot;: &quot;0755&quot;, &quot;owner&quot;: &quot;root&quot;, &quot;path&quot;: &quot;/home/${ansible_ssh_user}&quot;, &quot;size&quot;: 4096, &quot;state&quot;: &quot;directory&quot;, &quot;uid&quot;: 0} msg: chown failed: failed to look up user ${ansible_ssh_user} At this point, since Google wasn’t giving me helpful results in a timely manner, I pinged a friend on IRC and he suggested an alternate syntax, which works: --- - hosts: play remote_user: root tasks: - name: install Git apt: pkg=git state=latest - name: Create .ssh directory file: path=/home/{{ ansible_ssh_user }}/.ssh/ state=directory owner={{ ansible_ssh_user }} group={{ ansible_ssh_user }} - name: Install known_hosts file copy: src=known_hosts dest=/home/{{ ansible_ssh_user }}/.ssh/known_hosts owner={{ ansible_ssh_user }} group={{ ansible_ssh_user }} I’m glad it works like that, because it feels more like all the other Python-flavored templating that I’ve touched (Flask, Django, etc.). And it’s definitely a Python habit, but I prefer brain damage. I wonder if it’d be okay to put spaces around the = signs... one :%s/=/ = /g and an ansible-playbook invocation later, I find that adding spaces causes it to fail with an erorr like: fatal: [play] =&gt; a duplicate parameter was found in the argument string () Not freaking helpful. But next time I see it, I’ll recognize it as too many spaces rather than just being totally confused. Time to clone playpen Now I should, in theory, have the ability to clone a repo from github. Time to test this hypothesis.... I’m starting by reading then copying from the git module docs. Let’s try it: - name: Clone Playpen git: repo=git@github.com:thestinger/playpen.git dest=/home/{{ ansible_ssh_user }}/playpen_source And it fails, because it got a GitHub host key that wasn’t recognized. I guess there are actually several keys: # ssh-keygen -r github.com github.com IN SSHFP 1 1 7bc4945739c3552b9de0260f4524e05329587dea github.com IN SSHFP 1 2 b040403fc0992ef0bf9144d8aaa25049d8564839821eb592d7338399e456609c github.com IN SSHFP 2 1 ce76002677a077bf43dabb446a23e86bb127c8c3 github.com IN SSHFP 2 2 858dec00d20192cf334f54c96cccd5900f4540c2975e5d24c8236c255618c10c github.com IN SSHFP 3 1 261f7e4445378789267eb92c744e9e0d32a5f98d github.com IN SSHFP 3 2 a4ca08ec5bcf801885aa8b08b5deeb9a51c006988a5814e833f6ac08e81b021f In investigating which key I actually added to known_hosts, I discover a couple of worrisome things: First, my initial fumbling managed to create a /home/${ansible_ssh_user} directory, which is empty. Ha ha, I guess? I’ve manually removed it. Second, although Ansible claims to have installed the known_hosts file, I can’t actually see it. Actually after a bit more digging, it turns out that I was just being dumb at Unix. The system has a /.ssh created by DigitalOcean, which contains only my authorized_keys file. Ansible successfully created the /home/root/.ssh/known_hosts file, but cd as root takes you to / rather than to /home/root. Duh. Turns out that if I throw the known_hosts file into /.ssh, I can move on to the next error: failed: [play] =&gt; {&quot;cmd&quot;: &quot;/usr/bin/git ls-remote '' -h refs/heads/HEAD&quot;, &quot;failed&quot;: true, &quot;rc&quot;: 128} stderr: Permission denied (publickey). fatal: Could not read from remote repository. Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists. msg: Permission denied (publickey). fatal: Could not read from remote repository. Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists. Should’ve been using the HTTPS url, since I don’t want to add a public key from this machine to anybody’s github account, and I’ll never need to push back to the repo from my play server. Success! With that fix, it’s now successfully changed! The working playbook looks like this: --- - hosts: play remote_user: root tasks: - name: install Git apt: pkg=git state=latest - name: Create .ssh directory file: # The ansible_ssh_user is specified in the hosts file # For this host I'm using root, so .ssh location is special path=/.ssh/ state=directory owner={{ ansible_ssh_user }} group={{ ansible_ssh_user }} - name: Install known_hosts file copy: src=known_hosts dest=/.ssh/known_hosts owner={{ ansible_ssh_user }} group={{ ansible_ssh_user }} - name: Clone Playpen git: repo=https://github.com/thestinger/playpen.git dest=/home/{{ ansible_ssh_user }}/playpen_source Next Up My next steps will be to install the tools necesassary to build Playpen, and get Ansible to build it. I probably won’t keep up the “let’s-play” blog style, because it exponentially increases the amount of typing involved, and if you read this far you’re either a creepy stalker, thoroughly sick of hearing about my flailing at Ansible, or possibly both.

                   NS1:content=" Blog About GitHub Twitter Instagram 500px DavidMaitland.me Photography, Code &amp; Linux Raspberry Pi Zero Headless Setup 01 Dec 2015 raspberry-pi-zero-otg So last Thursday (26th Nov 2015) the Raspberry Pi Zero was announced and made available that very day. Basically the Zero is a small and ultra cheap (£4) fully functioning Raspberry Pi, but it doesn't have any native networking and has only one USB port (which you need an OTG adapter to use). In the UK I was lucky enough to be able to order two Pi Zero's and have them delivered the next day. The only problem was I didn't have an HDMI monitor or a USB hub to connect a keyboard and a WiFi adapter at the same time. My intended use for the Zero's is for them to be little headless Linux boxes that I can put into various electronic projects and program them over WiFi (Think IoT), so I didn't want to mess around with HDMI and GUI interfaces. So here is a little guide showing you how to setup a Raspberry Pi Zero without an HDMI monitor or a keyboard / mouse. We will just use a USB WiFi adapter (connected to the OTG USB port) and a Linux machine to do the setup. If you don't have a Linux machine available, you could even use another Rasberry Pi with a card reader to set this up. This should be possible to do on other platforms as well but you will need to be able to mount an Ext4 partition natively. Step One - Install the Linux image First you will need to install a copy of Raspbian Jessie onto your micro SD card. You can find the downloads here and the installation guides are on the same page as well. For Linux I will be using this guide. Step Two - Mounting it locally After you have copied the Raspbian image onto the SD card you will need to mount it to your system. The easiest way to do this is just unplug your card reader and plug it back in. Once the drive has mounted to your system you will need to find where it has mounted. An easy way to do this is using the command df -h. For example for me it returns: Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on /dev/mapper/fedora_dhcppc8-root 25G 9.8G 14G 43% / /dev/sda1 477M 258M 190M 58% /boot /dev/mapper/fedora_dhcppc8-home 85G 24G 58G 29% /home /dev/sdc1 60M 20M 41M 34% /run/media/davidmaitland/boot /dev/sdc2 59G 3.4G 53G 6% /run/media/davidmaitland/ad6203a1-ec50-4f44-a1c0-e6c3dd4c9202 I can see from this my 64GB SD card is the device /dev/sdc and the boot and main partition are mounted under /run/media/davidmaitland/. Change directory into the main partition as root ready to edit the files. This is likely to be the same drive that was referenced during the image installation earlier. [user@linux ~]# sudo su [root@linux ~]# cd /run/media/davidmaitland/ad6203a1-ec50-4f44-a1c0-e6c3dd4c9202 [root@linux ad6203a1-ec50-4f44-a1c0-e6c3dd4c9202]# ls bin boot boot.bak dev etc home lib lost+found media mnt opt proc root run sbin srv sys tmp usr var Step Three - Configure your WiFi Next we're going to configure the network interface. Edit the interfaces file etc/network/interfaces. Pay attention to the path in the files I reference, there is no leading slash as you want to edit the files on your SD card and not the ones on your host system! If you're not sure how to edit files on Linux, try nano etc/network/interfaces then Ctrl + x to save when done. Find this block in the file: allow-hotplug wlan0 iface wlan0 inet manual wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf Then change it to this: auto wlan0 allow-hotplug wlan0 iface wlan0 inet dhcp wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf If you want to have a static IP instead of using DHCP (easier to find once the Pi has come up on your network) then change it to this instead: auto wlan0 allow-hotplug wlan0 iface wlan0 inet static address 192.168.1.20 # IP for the Zero netmask 255.255.255.0 gateway 192.168.1.1 # Your router IP wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf As pointed out by someone on Reddit, if you're using static networking you will want to setup your DNS servers as well. Edit etc/resolv.conf and add the following: # Google's public DNS servers nameserver 8.8.8.8 nameserver 8.8.4.4 Now let's setup the WiFi connection and passkey. Edit the file etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf. Add this to the end: network={ ssid=&quot;my network name&quot; psk=&quot;my network password&quot; proto=RSN key_mgmt=WPA-PSK pairwise=CCMP auth_alg=OPEN } Finally remove the SD card from your computer (you may wish to unmount it first) and place into your Zero. Step Four - Boot the Pi Zero! Now it's time to boot the Raspberry Pi Zero. Make sure you have your WiFi adapter plugged into the Zero and give it some power. For me it takes about 45 seconds to boot and connect to my WiFi network. Now you can SSH directly into your Raspberry Pi Zero! If you configured your Zero to use DHCP you will need to find it's IP address. There are a few ways you can do this: Most routers will tell you somewhere in their web interfaces what IP allocations they have assigned to devices. You could use nmap to scan the local network for devices running with port 22 open sudo nmap -p22 -sV 192.168.0.0/24. From the comments Coder-256 pointed out the default hostname for a Raspberry Pi is raspberrypi and on most networks you can SSH directly to this instead of the IP address ssh pi@raspberrypi.local. The default password is raspberry. [user@linux ~]# ssh pi@192.168.1.20 pi@raspberrypi:~ $ Extras After a new install there are a few things you're probably going to want to do. First I would update the software running on your Zero: sudo apt-get update -y sudo apt-get upgrade -y If you're going to be using your Zero completely headlessly like me there are various things you can do to save energy and speed up the device. Boot up into multi-user mode (disable GUI on boot) sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target. To disable HDMI edit /etc/rc.local and add the following line at the bottom above exit 0 line: /usr/bin/tvservice -o You may want to run sudo raspi-config to change other common Raspberry Pi settings as well.

Ubuntu in Virtual Box did the trick on OSX. see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar Morris Singer David Maitland • a month ago Just a note to say I was able to do it on my Mac, but there were a few twists and turns that may put this out of the realm of some of those who will make the attempt. First, when using dd, it's important to note that on OS X, you can only specify the block size in bytes (so, make it 4*2^20, i.e., (4194304) rather than 4M. Second, as David Maitland correctly points out, because OS X does not support mounting ext4 partitions, only the boot partition (which is FAT) will load correctly. You can get around this by running a Linux distro (I ran Ubuntu) inside of a hypervisor and exposing the SD card reader to the guest. Instructions are detailed here for VirtualBox: http://superuser.com/questions.... I ran Ubuntu in VirtualBox with a head, and as a result, Ubuntu took care of actually mounting both of the SD card's partitions automatically, so I could fire up my Ubuntu VM and continue setting up the WiFi. YMMV. see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar Chris Ward • 7 months ago I never thought of mounting it to make changes before plugging it in. Good idea. For the name servers, maybe mention that those are googles servers. How did you get the image to have the whole card usable? I have had to boot my Pi, then expand the file system from the 4gig images up to size of card. see more 1 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar David Maitland Mod Chris Ward • 7 months ago Thanks! I may do, I did add that bit in after someone on Reddit complained about not showing how to add the name servers so was a quick addition. I got the image to use the whole card after I booted the Zero for the first time using the raspi-config command. I'm not sure of another way to do it. see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar Chris Ward David Maitland • 7 months ago Oh. I will have to try that. I was messing with parted and ex2fs to drop, then recreate the partition, then expand the file system.

I get 'could not resolve hostname' or 'connection timed out' when sshing. When I plug in the card to the usb port, 3 things show up on the ubuntu files menu with eject icons; there is 'boot', 'root' and 'settings'. 'Settings' also has a wpa_supplicant.conf file I noticed. Should this one be changed also? It doesn't have the code block from the instructions. I found the main partition to be /media/lerigalacticon/root#. This is the content of my interfaces file after the change: # interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8) # Please note that this file is written to be used with dhcpcd # For static IP, consult /etc/dhcpd.conf and 'man dhcpcd.conf' # Include files from /etc/network/interfaces.d: source-directory /etc/network/interfaces.d auto lo iface lo inet loopback iface eth0 inet manual auto wlan0 allow-hotplug wlan0 iface wlan0 inet dhcp wpa-conf etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf allow-hotplug wlan1 iface wlan1 inet manual wpa-conf etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf Could you give some advice as to how to get ssh working for me?

I put the new SD card in my RPI 3, did the configurations in your guide and then removed the SD card and put it in the Pi Zero. Maybe that explains it better? :) see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar Scott Kosman • a month ago Thanks so much for this guide, the step-by-step descriptions worked perfectly for me! One addition: I'm using the same WiFi dongle as you (Edimax EW-7811UN) and after I got it running I found that the wifi connection would drop out after about 30 seconds of idleness. Turns out that I had to disable power management on the dongle itself to keep the connection alive, which is very simple to do: Create a new empty file: sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/8192cu.conf Paste the following into it: options 8192cu rtw_power_mgnt=0 rtw_enusbss=0 Reboot. Done! No more wifi problems. see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar David Maitland Mod Scott Kosman • 20 days ago Interesting, haven't had this issue before. I wonder how much it increases the power usage of the Pi. see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar Scott Kosman David Maitland • 20 days ago Good question, I'm not sure how to even check that (I'm by no means an expert here – I found the above directions elsewhere after Googling the problem). I'm running mine in headless mode as well, though, so no HDMI port use or GUI so I'm not terribly concerned about power usage at this point. see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar wireddude • 5 months ago I'm able to get everything working up to the final step. Whenever I try to ssh into my PI, I get a connection refused.

Unfortunately I'm stuck at the Step One :( the problem is that I can't mount the SD card back! reconnecting it doesn't work, the mount command neither, because there is not a filesystem type assigned to the SD card.

Don't connect these pins directly to an RS232 serial port; they operate at +/- 12V and can damage your Arduino board. Serial is used for communication between the Arduino board and a computer or other devices. All Arduino boards have at least one serial port (also known as a UART or USART): Serial. It communicates on digital pins 0 (RX) and 1 (TX) as well as with the computer via USB. Thus, if you use these functions, you cannot also use pins 0 and 1 for digital input or output. You can use the Arduino environment's built-in serial monitor to communicate with an Arduino board. Click the serial monitor button in the toolbar and select the same baud rate used in the call to begin(). The Arduino Mega has three additional serial ports: Serial1 on pins 19 (RX) and 18 (TX), Serial2 on pins 17 (RX) and 16 (TX), Serial3 on pins 15 (RX) and 14 (TX). To use these pins to communicate with your personal computer, you will need an additional USB-to-serial adaptor, as they are not connected to the Mega's USB-to-serial adaptor. To use them to communicate with an external TTL serial device, connect the TX pin to your device's RX pin, the RX to your device's TX pin, and the ground of your Mega to your device's ground. The Arduino Due has three additional 3.3V TTL serial ports: Serial1 on pins 19 (RX) and 18 (TX); Serial2 on pins 17 (RX) and 16 (TX), Serial3 on pins 15 (RX) and 14 (TX). Pins 0 and 1 are also connected to the corresponding pins of the ATmega16U2 USB-to-TTL Serial chip, which is connected to the USB debug port. Additionally, there is a native USB-serial port on the SAM3X chip, SerialUSB'. The Arduino Leonardo board uses Serial1 to communicate via TTL (5V) serial on pins 0 (RX) and 1 (TX). Serial is reserved for USB CDC communication. For more information, refer to the Leonardo getting started page and hardware page.

By Minion | May 15, 2016 0 Comment In the Previous post, we have discussed about the procedure to create a bootable SD card using disks GUI. This tool may not be available every time. Some times, we may need to format the SD card or eMMC from the embedded Linux target it self. In such cases, we need to use Linux commands/tools to format the SD card. In this post, we will use “fdisk” command line tool and other filesystem tools to prepare a bootable SD card. Prerequisite : I would you recommend you to check the Previous post , section “SD card enumeration in Linux” to identify the proper SD card device node / name. Unless you know the proper device name, don’t proceed further. Because wrong usage of commands, can wipe your entire hard disk and lead to huge data loose. How many partitions required ? A primary/boot partition, formatted to FAT file format. This partition will have several components such as bootloaders, kernel, etc .. A secondary partition for root filesystem. Using ‘fdisk’ : step 1 : List your partition table and identify SD card / eMMC card. use below command $ sudo fdisk -l You will also get a similar log as below. minion@ubuntu:~$ sudo fdisk -l Disk /dev/sda: 214.7 GB, 214748364800 bytes 255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 26108 cylinders, total 419430400 sectors Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes Disk identifier: 0x000e3358 Device Boot Start End Blocks Id System /dev/sda1 * 2048 417333247 208665600 83 Linux /dev/sda2 417335294 419428351 1046529 5 Extended /dev/sda5 417335296 419428351 1046528 82 Linux swap / Solaris Disk /dev/sdb: 15.9 GB, 15931539456 bytes 255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 1936 cylinders, total 31116288 sectors Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes Disk identifier: 0x000d24fd Device Boot Start End Blocks Id System /dev/sdb1 63 31116287 15558112+ c W95 FAT32 (LBA) In my case, SD card device file name is /dev/sdb.

Logic Supply] which will help Serial Debug Cable For information on the serial debug cables go to Serial Debug Cables Board Revisions and Changes Revision C (Production Version) This revision increases the eMMC from 2GB to 4GB. We are making this change for several reasons: 1) Complaints from the community about lack of space left in the eMMC. 2) For those worried about their eMMC wearing out, the added space will help in the area of moving the data around to prevent wear out. Assuming of course you don't try and use it all. 3) Concerns over the long-term availability of the 2GB device. 4GB is currently the low end of the offering. This also gives us two sources. We are planning a price increase for the Rev C somewhere between $5 and $15. We are working to figure out where it needs to be. This is for several reasons: 1) To cover the increased cost of the 4G devices. 2) Currently there is $0 margin on these boards which limits our ability to bring more manufacturing capacity on line. Added some margin allows us to find more capacity. 3) Without margin, we cannot respond to component price increases due to market forces. This is of particular concern in the area of NAND and DDR3. We have been successful in fighting back some increases, but we don't know if that will continue. Revision B This version moves to the AM3358BZCZ100 processor as we are no longer able to get the limited production version of the AM3359AZCZ100. No changes in features or operation of the board resulted from this change. Revision A6A No changes in features or operation of the board. 1) Added optional zero ohm resistor to tie GND_OSC1 to system ground. 2) Changed C106 to a 1uF capacitor. 3) Changed C24 to a 2.2uF capacitor. This extends the reset signal to solve an issue where some boards would not boot on power up. 4) Removed R9 and installed R8. This change was based on an alert we just received from TI that there is a power sequencing issue with the TPS65217C power management IC and the power sequencing is incorrect. This change connects the VDDS rail to the VRTC rail. We do not believe at this time, that the issue is causing any issues with the boards, but we want to comply with the directive. Revision A6 No changes in features or operation of the board. 1) Based on notification from TI, in random instances there could be a glitch in the SYS_RESETn signal from the processor where the SYS_RESETn signal was taken high for a momentary amount of time before it was supposed to. To prevent this, the signal was ORed with the PORZn (Power On reset). 2) Noise issues were observed in other designs where the clock oscillator was getting hit due to a suspected issue in ground bounce. A zero ohm resistor was added to connect the OSC_GND to the system ground. 3) Moved the enable for the VDD_3V3B regulator to VDD_3V3A rail. Change was made to reduce the delay between the ramp up of the 3.3V rails. No evidence of this being an issue, but it really needs to be as close to the same as possible. Revision A5C Production had some fallout of boards when running the HDMI tests in the previous production run. Resistor values were tweaked to improve the test results. No changes in features or operation of the board. 1) Changed R46,R47,R48 to a 0 ohm. 2) Changed R45 to a 22 Ohm. Revision A5B 1) Updated the PCB to incorporate the modification that was being done on Rev A5A. There is NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL in functionality between REV A5A and REV A5B. 2) Made the LEDs dimmer for those that could not sleep due to the brightness of the LEDs. Revision A5A 1) Boards are built using the XAM3359AZCZ100 processor. 2) PCB Change...LCD noise issue was resolved by adding 47pf bypass caps on some of the LCD signals. 3) PCB Change...Added access to four battery charger signals on the TPS65217 (TS=Temperature Sense, BAT=Battery connection,BATT_SENSE=Battery voltage pin, GND=Ground). Pins are not populated but the four signals are in a 2x2 .1x.1 spacing. 4) PCB Change...Added a power button which allows for wake up, power down, and sleep options. It also provides the ability to alert the processor before powering down to provide an orderly shutdown. It is expected that SW will be used in conjunction with the switch to control the various power modes and transitions from one to the other. By holding the button down for 8 seconds, it will force a power down of the board. 5) Added a 100K pull down resistor from J1 pin 1 to J1 pin 4 to fix the unterminated serial port issue. Revision A4B Added a 100K pull down resistor between pins 1 and 4 of J1 to fix the serial port issue. Revision A4A Incorporated the capacitors to fix the noise issue on the display Revision A4 First prototype release version of the board. Limited distribution. One notable issue here is that the board has an AM3352 processor instead of an AM3359, despite how the part is marked. Part was mismarked as an AM3359. The SGX and PRU are not operational. Tips and Pointers Expansion Header Pin Usage There are several precautions that need to me taken when working with the expansion headers to prevent damage to the board. ALL VOLTAGE LEVELS ARE 3.3V MAX. APPLICATION OF 5V TO ANY I/O PIN WILL DAMAGE THE PROCESSOR AND VOID THE WARRANTY. ANALOG IN VOLTAGES ARE 1.8V MAX. APPLICATION OF &gt;1.8V TO ANY A/D PIN WILL DAMAGE THE PROCESSOR AND VOID THE WARRANTY. 1) Do not apply any voltages to any I/O pins when the board is not powered on. 2) Do not drive any external signals into the I/O pins until after the SYS_RESETn signal is HI (3.3V). 3) Do not apply any voltages that are generated from external sources until SYS_RESETn signal is HI. 4) If voltages are generated from the VDD_5V signal, those supplies must not become active until after the SYS_RESETn signal is HI. 5) If you are applying signals from other boards into the expansion headers, make sure you power the board up after you power up the BeagleBone Black or make the connections after power is applied on both boards. In the System Reference Manual you will find reference to Boot Pins. These pins are connected to the expansion header. If you load or terminate these pins to the point it affects their default setting, the board will not boot. Powering the processor via its I/O pins can cause damage to the processor. The expansion headers can be viewed on this Cape Expansion Headers. Serial Header Usage Power restrictions on the serial debug header are not an issue. On the board, there is a buffer that prevents damage from occurring by having the connector of the FTDI cable connected to the the header. It is safe to do and will not cause damage to the board when power is not applied to the board.

Missing Cables REV A4,A4A Does not ship with any cables. Rev A5 will ship with the USB cable. Display Noise REV A4 If you look closely, you will notice some noise in the display. This is due to a termination issue on the board caused by too many connections to the LCD data pins. This will be fixed on the A5 revision. Serial Debug CrashREV A4, A4A Serial port can cause the system to crash if there is not a serial cable plugged into J1. Improper Power Down....All Revisions We have been noticing a very small number of boards that are experiencing power issues, where the LED flashes and the board does not power up. We have been chasing this for a while now and due to the small number of boards that have the issue and the fact that the issue can also be caused by having things connected to IO pins not powered correctly, it has been hard to nail down. Our initial take was that it was a manufacturing issue on some boards, but we could never prove that. Based on the latest information we have gathered, this appears to be an instance where the PMIC does not power down the processor in the right order due to the violent removal of the power cables, either USB or DC. So, we are recommending that the power button be used to power off the board or by issuing the Halt command. After that you can remove the power cable. If everyone follows this process, we should see a decrease in these issues, but it will take a while for the results, either good or bad, to show up. This will also help prevent the contamination of the eMMC and the SD cards by allowing the kernel to shutdown properly before power is removed. Another issue that we have seen is that the power supply when plugged in will create a spike that exceeds the voltage rating of the PMIC or will cause the voltage to drop momentarily. This can occur after power up cycle has started. When this occurs, the PMIC will shutdown. This can cause the processor to be powered down before it is powered all the way up, damaging the processor. It is suggested that to prevent this that you use a well regulated power supply that can handle the current surge of the powering up process. Software Resources Debian Beta Image All boards now ship with the Debian image.

These capes are made by a lot of different companies and individuals. A list of capes that are in production are listed at BeagleBone Capes. If you have a cape that is in production and can be purchased and you would like it listed, please contact Circuitco. More information regarding the Cape Expansion Headers can be found at Cape Expansion Headers. Most of the current capes will work with the BeagleBone Black at some point. However, the kernel is 3.8 on the BeagleBone Black, so work is required to get the drivers updated for most of the capes to work. Some may not work or may require some hardware changes due to some differences in the design of the BeagleBone Black as described below. For a list of the ones that are currently identified as compatible and incompatible, go to BeagleBone Black Capes. Onboard HDMI The onboard HDMI driver uses the LCD pins. They are still connected to the expansion header, but in some cases, they could cause an LCD cape to have some noise issues unless the cape has a buffer. A buffer should take care of this issue. If you want to use these pins as GPIO pins, you may be limited in speed due to the capacitance caused by the loadig of the pins by the HDMI driver. They should function fine in most applications. Onboard eMMC The onboard eMMC uses the MMC1 signals. They are also connected to the expansion header. The expectation is that in order to use these signals, the eMMC device on the BeagleBone Black will need to be disabled by activating the reset line to the eMMC device. It is not clear that this will work as you have to write to the eMMC first and tell it to enable the reset. At this point in time, it is not totally clear that the reset line will do the trick. Further investigation is ongoing. This will also require booting from the uSD port. Best option is to not use the MMC1_CLK and MMC1_CMD signals at all and tie them low. Do not use these signals for anything else will trying to use the other eMMC1 lines on the expansion header. 10Pin Connector The 10 pin power expansion header has been removed. Any cape needing this connector will not be 100% compatible. Regulatory Compliance Documents FCC CE REACH Export Information ECCN: 5A002A1 CCATS: G141473 Documents RMA Support If you feel the board is defective and you want to get it looked at go to RMA Request You will need the serial number. It is located on the expansion header in the form of a white label. We only accept RMA requests for those boards purchased through authorized BeagleBoard.org distributors. You can find a list of authorized distributors on the buy pages at BeagleBoard.org If you purchase a board from an unauthorized distributor, you need to return the board to them for replacement or repair.

                   NS1:content=" site logo Embedded Reflections Logikon Labs Blog Menu Skip to content How-to create a custom microSD card image for the BeagleBone Black 8 Replies beagle logoThis article serves as a guide on how to create a custom microSD card image for the BeagleBone Black. The steps described in this guide are pretty much platform agnostic. One could also adjust them to other systems, besides the BeagleBone Black. The BeagleBone Black is an open hardware ARM single-board computer, very popular for its attractive price and rich set of features. The system ships with an Ångström Linux distribution installed in its internal 2GB flash, while a microSD card slot allows running other operating systems as well (or replacing the contents of the internal flash). Various pre-made microSD card images are available, and eewiki.net has very detailed steps on creating a microSD with your own contents. However, what we could not find (and decided to write about it) was a guide on how to generate our own image of a microSD for the BeagleBone Black. This can come in handy in several situations, such as when you want to: prepare all the work without having the actual microSD card at hand. use the card image in a virtual machine. maintain different versions of your installation. automate the process via scripts, without being forced to write the result to a microSD card every time. speed up the creation of multiple microSD cards from the same image. The following links were used as input while writing this guide. http://eewiki.net/display/linuxonarm/BeagleBone+Black https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Creating_Arch_Linux_disk_image Prerequisites In order to perform the tasks described in this guide, you will need the following. A standard GNU/linux distribution. We use Debian. Root access via sudo. If you prefer su, adjust the steps accordingly. The sfdisk tool. In Debian-based distributions, install the package “util-linux”. The kpartx tool. In Debian-based distributions, install the package “kpartx”. The mkfs.vfat and mkfs.ext4 tools. In Debian-based distributions, install the packages “dosfstools” and “e2fsprogs”. Optionally, you might also want to use the following. The ddrescue tool. In Debian-based distributions, install the package “gddrescue”. The qemu-img tool. In Debian-based distributions, install the package “qemu-utils”. If you use a Debian-based distribution and you want to install all of the above tools at once, you can issue the following command. $ sudo apt-get install util-linux kpartx dosfstools e2fsprogs gddrescue qemu-utils Image preparation Create an empty image The first step is to create an empty image file of an appropriate size. For our example, we will be creating a 500MiB image file (with a MiB being defined by IEC as 1024×1024 bytes, also known as a Mebibyte). This task can be accomplished in many ways. The most standard way is to use the dd command, which is available and installed in all GNU/Linux distributions, as part of the GNU coreutils software package. $ dd if=/dev/zero of=bbb.img bs=1M count=500 In the above command, we create a file named bbb.img, filled with zeroes, using 500 blocks of 1MiB each. Another way is to make use of a little utility from QEMU. $ qemu-img create bbb.img 500M Partition the image The next step is to create partitions inside the empty image file, as if it were a physical storage media. We use sfdisk for this task and we provide all the necessary parameters via standard input. $ sudo sfdisk --in-order --Linux --unit M bbb.img &lt;&lt; EOF 1,48,0xE,* ,,,- EOF In the above example, we create two partitions inside our image file. The first one will be the boot partition, starting at an offset of 1MiB, with a size of 48MiB and partition id “W95 FAT16 (LBA)”. The second one will consume all remaining space (451MiB in our example) and will have the default partition id (“Linux”). Format and mount the partitions As with any newly-partitioned media, we also have to create filesystems inside our partitions. However, before we do that, we will use the excellent kpartx command from multipath-tools, to make the handling of the partitions inside our image easier. $ sudo kpartx -av bbb.img Keep note of the output of the above command, in our example it was: add map loop0p1 (253:0): 0 98304 linear /dev/loop0 2048 add map loop0p2 (253:1): 0 923648 linear /dev/loop0 100352 We are mainly interested in the loop device name (in our case loop0). The above command makes use of the device mapper mechanism of the linux kernel to create virtual block devices for the two partitions inside our image. Assuming that kpartx reported loop0 as the loop device name, our two partitions will now be available as /dev/mapper/loop0p1 and /dev/mapper/loop0p2. We can now format our partitions and mount them in temporary folders. We use FAT16 for the boot partition and assign the label “boot” to it, and EXT4 for the root partition and assign the label “rootfs” to it. $ sudo mkfs.vfat -F 16 /dev/mapper/loop0p1 -n boot sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/loop0p2 -L rootfs mkdir -p tmpmnt/boot mkdir -p tmpmnt/rootfs sudo mount /dev/mapper/loop0p1 tmpmnt/boot/ sudo mount /dev/mapper/loop0p2 tmpmnt/rootfs/ Make sure that you replace the loop device names with whatever was reported when you executed the kpartx command. We are now ready to add files to our image. Adding files to image With both our partitions mounted as virtual block devices, we can copy any files we like into them, using any standard file copying method, be it command-line or graphical. For a typical BeagleBone Black installation, we will be copying the bootloader (u-boot), the linux kernel image (zImage) and the compiled device tree structures (.dtb files) to the boot partition, while the actual root filesystem and any linux kernel modules will be copied to the root partition. You can refer to the BeagleBone Black page on eewiki.net for more information on how to obtain these files and where exactly to copy them inside your image file. You can also check out the Debian Live project if you are looking for a way to generate your own root file system from scratch. Assuming that you have the bootloader, kernel and filesystem, make sure that you first copy the MLO file, followed by the u-boot.img file of the bootloader into an empty, freshly formatted FAT16 boot partition. The remaining files can be copied in any order. Finish image creation When we are done with adding files to the image, we must make sure that all files have finished being copied to the image, unmount the virtual block devices and release them. $ sync sudo umount tmpmnt/boot/ sudo umount tmpmnt/rootfs/ sudo kpartx -dv bbb.img That’s all. The image is now ready and you can use it as it is, or copy it to a microSD card. Copy image to microSD card (optional) To copy the image file to a microSD card, you can use the standard dd command. $ sudo dd if=bbb.img of=[block_device] Alternatively, we suggest using ddrescue, which has a more verbose output. $ sudo ddrescue -f bbb.img [block_device] In the above commands, replace [block_device] with the block device name of your microSD card (such as /dev/sdx). facebooktwittergoogle_plusredditlinkedinmail This entry was posted in ARM, Embedded, Linux, Open Hardware, Open Source and tagged beagle, beaglebone black, howto, image, microsd on February 27, 2014 by Dimitris Lampridis.

Cou you please eleborate little bit.

Thanks for spotting that! [1]: http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/io-redirection.html Reply ↓ Gerb November 15, 2015 at 18:07 With the latest version of util-linux 2.27.+ some of the sfdisk options got removed and the sfdisk command you have listed doesn’t work anymore. Or atleast in Fedora 23. I had to change it to this to: sudo sfdisk /dev/sdX &lt;&lt; EOF 1M,48M,0xE,* ,,,- EOF This gives me a boot partition of 48MiB FAT16 LBA (offset by 1 MiB) and a Linux (rootfs) partition for the rest of the sdcard. Does that seem like the correct way to prepare the sdcard for the beaglebone? Reply ↓ Dimitris LampridisDimitris Lampridis Post authorNovember 16, 2015 at 10:34 Unfortunately, I don’t have a system with util-linux 2.27+ to test this, but if you get two partitions with the first being 48MiB FAT16 LBA, offset by 1 MiB, and the second one being Linux with all the remaining space, then I don’t see a problem. Reply ↓ Srujan Sriram December 4, 2015 at 19:40 Based on these steps, can I directly boot from the Micro-SD after completing step – “Copy image to microSD card (optional)”? Reply ↓ Dimitris LampridisDimitris Lampridis Post authorDecember 7, 2015 at 10:59 Yes, you will be able to boot from the microSD, assuming that you have copied the correct files (bootloader, kernel, device tree blob, root filesystem) and in the correct order (step “Adding files to image”). Reply ↓ Sam April 3, 2016 at 06:45 Forgive me if im being foolish here: “make sure that you first copy the MLO file, followed by the u-boot.img file of the bootloader into an empty, freshly formatted FAT16 boot partition.” say ive followed along the eewiki article and build myself u-boot and a kernel. im drawing a blank as to how exactly to “copy” [read install] MLO, u-boot.img etc into the boot partition we have mounted at ~/tmpmnt/boot. is cp used or a dd block copy. doing this for learning purposes to make a minimal debian SD Image from scratch, and all the niceties that go with it. Reply ↓ Dimitris LampridisDimitris Lampridis Post authorApril 4, 2016 at 00:22 Just a standard “cp”. But, it is important to respect the order. On a freshly-formatted FAT16 partition, copy first the MLO, followed by u-boot.img. Reply ↓ Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

                   NS1:content=" Raspberry-at-home.com – Your ultimate source of Raspberry Pi tutorials (WiFi, 3G, XBMC, Subtitles, VoD, TVN Player, IPLA, TVP, Squeezeslave, Logitech Media Server, Sickbeard, Webcam, Torrent, DLNA) Basics Software Hardware Tips &amp; Tricks About Installing 3G modem Posted by Jacek Tokar Posted on March 19, 2013 Posted under Hardware Comments 22 Comments If you have 3G modem, you can easily connect it to your precious RPi and have internet everywhere you go. This can be first step to turn your RPi into wireless 3G router or you can just do it to make sure, that wherever you go, XBMC would be able to download subtitles for the movie :) So, here are step by step instructions… If you need to buy 3G modem, make sure that it is well supported by RPi – this article was tested using Huawei 220. Verified peripherals can be found here Before we start, connect your modem to powered USB hub and connect the hub to your RPi. Now you can turn on RPi. I always recommend running package update before we start installing anything: sudo apt-get update 1 sudo apt-get update No we need to install ppp: sudo apt-get install ppp 1 sudo apt-get install ppp Now we need a client to connect to the internet – name of the program is sakis3G. [14-June-2013] sakis3g stopped working for me in raspbmc. If you also have problems see bottom of the article where I use wvdial. SAKIS3G version Since at the time when this article was created, web site www.sakis3g.org was not working, you can download sakis3g from our server. From RPi shell you can download it like this: wget &quot;http://raspberry-at-home.com/files/sakis3g.tar.gz&quot; 1 wget &quot;http://raspberry-at-home.com/files/sakis3g.tar.gz&quot; I suggest you copy the file to /usr/bin/modem3g directory and unpack it: sudo mkdir /usr/bin/modem3g sudo chmod 777 /usr/bin/modem3g sudo cp sakis3g.tar.gz /usr/bin/modem3g cd /usr/bin/modem3g sudo tar -zxvf sakis3g.tar.gz sudo chmod +x sakis3g 1 2 3 4 5 6 sudo mkdir /usr/bin/modem3g sudo chmod 777 /usr/bin/modem3g sudo cp sakis3g.tar.gz /usr/bin/modem3g cd /usr/bin/modem3g sudo tar -zxvf sakis3g.tar.gz sudo chmod +x sakis3g Sakis3G is smart enough to read internet settings from your sim card – all you need to do is to point it to use the right connection setting. Here is what we get without any further configuration (for now): sudo ./sakis3g connect Please select APN by using APN variable, or by enabling interactive mode. $ /usr/bin/modem3g/sakis3g --interactive &quot;connect&quot; Available options are: Internet (Internet) CUSTOM_APN Custom APN... Example: $ /usr/bin/modem3g/sakis3g APN=&quot;Internet&quot; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 sudo ./sakis3g connect Please select APN by using APN variable, or by enabling interactive mode. $ /usr/bin/modem3g/sakis3g --interactive &quot;connect&quot; Available options are: Internet (Internet) CUSTOM_APN Custom APN... Example: $ /usr/bin/modem3g/sakis3g APN=&quot;Internet&quot; Internet is a APN setting from my SIM card. In order to use it you can start sakis3g with the command as in example above and adding connect word, but personally I suggest creation of /etc/sakis3g.conf file with single line: APN=&quot;Internet&quot; 1 APN=&quot;Internet&quot; Please note that the line can be different for your operator/APN setting. In case (for some reason) sakis3G is not able to detect your internet APN setting you can enter in conf file all other necessary information. In this case follow instructions from ./sakis3g man sakis3g.conf When you’re done with creation of /etc/sakis3g.conf you can now run: sudo ./sakis3g connect E220 connected to PLAY (26006). 1 2 sudo ./sakis3g connect E220 connected to PLAY (26006). To disconnect just run: sudo ./sakis3g disconnect Disconnected. 1 2 sudo ./sakis3g disconnect Disconnected. If you don’t want to play with conf file you can always start sakis3G in interactive mode (even in console): /usr/bin/modem3g/sakis3g --interactive &quot;menu&quot; &quot;console&quot; 1 /usr/bin/modem3g/sakis3g --interactive &quot;menu&quot; &quot;console&quot; wvdial version WVDIAL is less intuitive then sakis3g and I find it quite hardcore but so far I haven’t found more decent replacement. First, we need to install wvdial: sudo apt-get -y install wvdial 1 sudo apt-get -y install wvdial Once installed we need to create a config file for it (/etc/wvdial.conf). Content of this file may be a bit different for some of you (if it is, let me know) but here is mine: pi@raspbmc:~$ cat /etc/wvdial.conf [Dialer Defaults] Init1 = ATZ Init2 = ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &amp;C1 &amp;D2 +FCLASS=0 Modem Type = Analog Modem Baud = 9600 New PPPD = yes Modem = /dev/ttyUSB0 ISDN = 0 ; Phone = &lt;Target Phone Number&gt; ; Password = &lt;Your Password&gt; ; Username = &lt;Your Login Name&gt; [Dialer play] Modem = /dev/ttyUSB0 Baud = 460800 Init1 = ATH Init2 = ATE1 Init3 = AT+CGDCONT=1,&quot;IP&quot;,&quot;internet&quot; Dial Command = ATD Phone = *99# Stupid mode = yes Username = &quot;blank&quot; Password = &quot;blank&quot; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 pi@raspbmc:~$ cat /etc/wvdial.conf [Dialer Defaults] Init1 = ATZ Init2 = ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &amp;C1 &amp;D2 +FCLASS=0 Modem Type = Analog Modem Baud = 9600 New PPPD = yes Modem = /dev/ttyUSB0 ISDN = 0 ; Phone = &lt;Target Phone Number&gt; ; Password = &lt;Your Password&gt; ; Username = &lt;Your Login Name&gt; [Dialer play] Modem = /dev/ttyUSB0 Baud = 460800 Init1 = ATH Init2 = ATE1 Init3 = AT+CGDCONT=1,&quot;IP&quot;,&quot;internet&quot; Dial Command = ATD Phone = *99# Stupid mode = yes Username = &quot;blank&quot; Password = &quot;blank&quot; Section [Dialer Defaults] is automatically created when wvdial is installed. I have added section [Dialer play], because my GSM operator is PLAY MOBILE :). [Dialer play] section overrides settings from [Dialer Defaults] if there are any conflicts. Let me try to explain what [Dialer play] config items mean: [Dialer play] Modem = /dev/ttyUSB0 #device you will be using to connect - you may need to change it in case your modem is not detected with that setting Baud = 460800 #baud rate - I am not sure what the setting should be and how it can impact network throughput - it is speed at which wvdial will communicate with your modem #InitX commands belowy are Hayes commands that will be sent to modem Init1 = ATH #hangup Init2 = ATE1 #echo commands so we see what is going on Init3 = AT+CGDCONT=1,&quot;IP&quot;,&quot;internet&quot; #defines packet data protocol context # 1 : PDP context ID, minimum value is 1, maximum value depends on device (to be honest no idea what that is :) ) # protocol name [IP|IPv6|PPP] # internet - is my APN name - may be different for you - check with your operator if needed Dial Command = ATD # command to dial the number; not really needed in my case Phone = *99# # number to dial (can be different for you) Stupid mode = yes # wvdial will not interpret any prompts from the server Username = &quot;blank&quot; # put user name here if you ISP requires it.

Please note the line “[1] 3143” – 3143 is your connection process PID.

For some reason RPi would not get proper DNS even if you disconnect eth0 after you connect with the modem, so: first disconnect your lan cable and then connect.

All of these need to be provided to allow you to log in. Email and password will be provided by your code. The rest of the fields actually have their values set by the HTML that Facebook serves you. This means, to emulate a browser login you need to perform the following steps: Do a GET to the login page (https://m.facebook.com/) Use a HTML parsing library (e.g. BeautifulSoup) to parse the HTML and find the default values of the form fields. The default values are all in &lt;input&gt; HTML elements below the #login_form element. You'll want to find them by name (e.g. charset_test) and then pull out their value attribute. Working out how to do this is outside the scope of this answer, so I'm not going to go into it. Combine the default values of the form fields with your email and password, like so: data = { 'lsd': lsd, 'charset_test': csettest, 'version': version, 'ajax': ajax, 'width': width, 'pxr': pxr, 'gps': gps, 'm_ts': mts, 'li': li, } data['email'] = email data['pass'] = pass data['login'] = 'Log In' Send your login using a Requests Session: s = requests.Session() r = s.post(url, data=data) r.raise_for_status() Send all your future HTTP traffic through that Session. As you can see, this is a non-trivial way of doing things. That's because it's not expected that programs will use the website to log in: instead, you're expected to use their SDK or their web API instead. share|improve this answer answered Feb 21 '14 at 9:43 Lukasa 3,0081019 1 Thank you very much!

So, i used mechanize. import mechanize browser = mechanize.Browser() browser.set_handle_robots(False) cookies = mechanize.CookieJar() browser.set_cookiejar(cookies) browser.addheaders = [('User-agent', 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.7 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/7.0.517.41 Safari/534.7')] browser.set_handle_refresh(False) url = 'http://www.facebook.com/login.php' self.browser.open(url) self.browser.select_form(nr = 0) #This is login-password form -&gt; nr = number = 0 self.browser.form['email'] = YourLogin self.browser.form['pass'] = YourPassw response = self.browser.submit() print response.read() It works. mechanize.browser is emulated browser, so you don't need to send all form values. It will send them as normal browser, you should provide only login and password.

You can't just send user+pass, the server won't allow it. Secondly you will need to take care and use the cookies recieved from Facebook in order for this to work. But all in all, yes you can use request or any other library. But i would reccomend using their API instead. share|improve this answer answered Feb 21 '14 at 7:58 Torxed 9,13553867 add a comment | up vote 0 down vote I can say it's quite annoying to log in to Facebook without using their API. They also like to change everything so often it is quite the job to maintain the code. I did this a while ago, but I don't think my code is up to speed with current Facebook. However it should be a useful starting-point: https://gitorious.org/blogsmashonfb/blogsmashonfb/source/4f7ee94a56fdffe9392485df8999e340f97f4bbe: It has two parts, a webcrawler and a Facebook-handler (the latter is what you are interested in). One major issue you have in your code is that you must first visit Facebook, because they send you a login form with hidden elements that you need to send back. share|improve this answer edited Feb 21 '14 at 9:44 answered Feb 21 '14 at 9:38 deinonychusaur 2,42611330 add a comment | Your Answer draft saved draft discarded Sign up or log in Sign up using Google Sign up using Facebook Sign up using Email and Password Post as a guest Name Email discard By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service.

Raw HowToOTGFast.md Setting up Pi Zero OTG - The quick way (No USB keyboard, mouse, HDMI monitor needed) More details - http://blog.gbaman.info/?p=791 For this method, alongside your Pi Zero, MicroUSB cable and MicroSD card, only an additional computer is required, which can be running Windows (with Bonjour, iTunes or Quicktime installed), Mac OS or Linux (with Avahi Daemon installed, for example Ubuntu has it built in). 1. Flash Raspbian Jessie full or Raspbian Jessie Lite onto the SD card. 2. Once Raspbian is flashed, open up the boot partition (in Windows Explorer, Finder etc) and add to the bottom of the config.txt file dtoverlay=dwc2 on a new line, then save the file. 3. Finally, open up the cmdline.txt. Be careful with this file, it is very picky with its formatting! Each parameter is seperated by a single space (it does not use newlines). Insert modules-load=dwc2,g_ether after rootwait. To compare, an edited version of the cmdline.txt file at the time of writing, can be found here. 4. That's it, eject the SD card from your computer, put it in your Raspberry Pi Zero and connect it via USB to your computer. It will take up to 90s to boot up (shorter on subsequent boots). It should then appear as a USB Ethernet device. You can SSH into it using raspberrypi.local as the address. @developius developius commented on 19 May AWESOME! @shrx shrx commented on 19 May • edited Thanks, it just works. (also on the Jessie Lite image, I had no problems.) @ZudoMC ZudoMC commented on 19 May My Zero (Jessie full) doesn't show up as a device. Followed all the steps here. @sourcedgeek sourcedgeek commented on 20 May Could this effectively be used to VNC into the Zero for a GUI interface? @langphil langphil commented on 20 May I can't seem to get Avahi Daemon installed on OSX. Any pointers would be greatly appreciated. @trevorhales trevorhales commented on 21 May On PC Windows 10 I had to modify the firewall settings for Bonjour so that the &quot;Setting up Pi Zero OTG&quot; worked! @andrewn andrewn commented on 22 May @langphil, you don't need to install Avahi Daemon on OSX as it comes with Bonjour pre-installed and already running, which does the same thing. Once you've followed the steps above you can just ssh pi@raspberrypi.local to access the Zero. @apemanzilla apemanzilla commented on 23 May Whenever I try this the Raspberry Pi shows up as an unknown USB device in Windows. I've tried Windows 10 and Windows 7 with the same results. Any way to fix this? @TweetPete TweetPete commented 29 days ago On my windows 10 computer the Zero is detected as Serial USB device (COM3) but not as Ethernet device.

                   NS1:content=" Skip to Navigation Click to subscribe Login Linux Journal A 10-Minute Guide for Using PPP to Connect Linux to the Internet Issue 36 From Issue #36 April 1997 Apr 01, 1997 By Terry Dawson in HOWTOs Having trouble connecting to the Internet? Here's an easy way to do it using PPP. Connecting your Linux machine to the Internet with PPP is easy in most situations. In this article I show you how to configure PPP for the most common type of connection. We assume your Linux machine is a stand-alone machine that dials into an Internet Service Provider and performs an automatic login, and the Internet Service Provider allocates the IP address that your machine will use. You can find details of how to configure PPP for other situations in the PPP-HOWTO by Robert Hart. You will need the right software and a couple of pieces of information before you start. Let's get started. Preparation First, check that you have the right software. The program that manages PPP for Linux is called pppd. The pppd program is linked very tightly with the kernel, so you must run a version of pppd that matches your kernel. Kernel Version pppd version 1.2.* 2.1.2d 1.3.0 -&gt; 1.3.84 2.1.2d 1.3.84 -&gt; 1.3.99 2.2.0f 2.0.* 2.2.0f 2.1.* 2.2.0f Check the version of pppd and kernel that you have installed with the following commands: $ /usr/sbin/pppd version $ uname -a The first command is a trick. The pppd command doesn't actually have a version option. However, the version number will appear in the error message pppd returns, since you have supplied it with a bad argument. If the first command fails, you probably don't have PPP installed. You can obtain the latest version of the source from: ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/Network/serial/ppp/ If you have installed from a distribution such as Debian, Red Hat or Slackware, the pppd program is available precompiled within those distributions. You just have to get the package and install it. Next you must check that your kernel has PPP support. Do this by giving the command: $ dmesg | grep -i ppp You should see the following messages: PPP: version 2.2.0 (dynamic channel allocation) PPP Dynamic channel allocation code copyright 1995 Caldera, Inc. PPP line discipline registered. If not, PPP may have been installed as a module. Become root and try: # insmod ppp If that fails, you will have to rebuild your kernel with PPP support. Follow the instructions in /usr/src/linux/README, and when configuring your kernel ensure that you answer “Yes” to: General setup ---&gt; [*] Networking support Network device support ---&gt; [*] Network device support &lt;*&gt; PPP (point-to-point) support These prompts may be different in non-2.0 kernels. Next you must note what keystrokes you will send and what prompts you will receive to log in to your ISP. The best way to collect these is to try manually logging into your ISP using a terminal program such as minicom. Be sure to make note of the capitalization of prompts such as the “login:” prompt as this will be important later. A typical scenario follows: Expect Send Comment ------ ---- ------- nothing AT&amp;F/r (mode reset) OK AT&amp;D2&amp;C1/r (mode initialization) OK AT&amp;D555-9999/r (modem dialing command) The modem dials, sends CONNECT message and then you enter userid and password as follows: login: username/r password: password/r Lastly, you must know the IP address of a nameserver so that you can configure your name resolver and use host names instead of IP addresses. Get this information from your ISP. Configuring PPP The pppd program can accept configuration parameters from two places. The first is from the command line, and the second is from “options” files. The arguments supplied are close to identical in either case, but the command line method can be messy. So I will describe how to configure PPP using the options files instead. The normal location of the options file is: /etc/ppp/options The options file is a simple text file containing parameters pppd will use when it is executed—one parameter per line. The options file must be readable by whoever will execute the pppd program. In most installations this will be root, either directly or by executing pppd from a program like sudo. If you don't have an /etc/ppp directory, as root create one using the following commands: # mkdir /etc/ppp # chown root:root /etc/ppp # chmod 755 /etc/ppp Create an /etc/ppp/options file that looks like the following example: debug /dev/ttyS0 38400 modem crtscts lock connect /etc/ppp/net-connect asyncmap 0 defaultroute : This example assumes: You want PPP to give you diagnostic information as it runs. Your modem is connected to serial device /dev/ttyS0. You want the serial port speed to be set at 38400 bps. You want to listen to the Data Carrier Detect signal. You will use hardware (RTS/CTS) handshaking. Your dialer program is /etc/ppp/net-connect. You have a full 8 bit clean connection. By default datagrams should be sent via the PPP link. You want the PPP server that you call to assign the IP address you will use. These are all fairly typical defaults for an ISP connection. You will have to adjust the serial device to suit where you have your modem connected and, if you are using data compression, you might want to set your serial port speed to something higher. PPP provides a means of escaping select characters, so that they do not interfere with your connection. For example, if you were running PPP over a link that would disconnect if it received a control-D character, you could ask PPP to escape that character, and it would automatically replace it with another and reverse the process at the other end. While the default is safe, it escapes a number of characters that normally don't need escaping and this will decrease the performance of your link. Since most ISPs provide 8 bit clean links you don't need to escape any characters, so we tell pppd not to, using the asyncmap option. The pppd package includes a program called chat. The chat program is a simple program that can be used to automate the dialing procedure. The chat program also accepts arguments from the command line or from a file. Again I'll describe how to configure it from a file as this is the better method. To make use of the chat program from within pppd, we must ensure that the connect option points to a script that calls chat. Create a script called /etc/ppp/net-connect that looks like: #!/bin/sh /usr/sbin/chat -v -t 60 -f /etc/ppp/net-chat This shell script will invoke the chat command with the -v, -t and -f arguments. The -v argument is useful when you are configuring pppd, as it sends verbose diagnostic messages to the system log to show you what is happening as the chat program runs. The -t 60 argument simply tells the chat program to wait 60 seconds for the expected text to arrive before timing out with an error. The -f argument tells chat the name of the file it should use to get the expect/send sequences it will use to login. Make sure the script is readable and executable by whoever will invoke pppd. Assuming again that “whoever” is root, use the following commands: # chmod 500 /etc/ppp/net-connect # chown root:root /etc/ppp/net-connect Create a chat script called /etc/ppp/net-chat that will automate the login sequence as described earlier. I will base this script on the details presented in the table. ABORT &quot;BUSY&quot; ABORT &quot;NO CARRIER&quot; &quot;&quot; AT&amp;F\r OK AT&amp;D2&amp;C1\r OK ATD555-9999\r ogin: sword: The first two lines are special. The ABORT keyword is a special token that allows you to specify strings of characters that will cause the chat program to exit. In the example presented, if the chat program receives either the string &quot;BUSY&quot; or the string &quot;NO CARRIER&quot; then it will abort immediately. The rest of the file is a simple list of expect/send pairs, based on the information we gathered when we manually logged in. The above example reads in full: ABORT the script if we receive &quot;BUSY&quot; or &quot;NO CARRIER&quot;. Expect nothing, then send AT&amp;F&lt; carriage-return&gt; to reset the modem to factory configuration, expect to receive OK then send AT&amp;D2&amp;C1&lt;carriage-return&gt;, then expect OK and send ATD555-9999&lt;carriage-return&gt;, then expect login: and send username&lt;carriage-return&gt;, then expect sword: and send password&lt;carriage-return&gt;, and then exit normally. There are a couple of important points to note in this example. First, the modem initialization string I've suggested will, in most modems, ensure that the modem will raise the Data Carrier Detect line when a call is connected, and will hang up the call if the DTR line is lowered. This ensures that the modem is matched with the modem option supplied to pppd. Second, I haven't used the full prompt, but only the last few characters. This is generally good practice because under some circumstances the first characters from a line may be dropped. Looking only for the last few characters ensures our login succeeds even if this occurs. Finally, you will notice the &lt;carriage-return&gt; is coded as \r. There are a range of other characters may be encoded and sent in this way, if necessary. The chat man page explains what they are should you need to use them. Finally, we must ensure this script is readable by whoever will invoke pppd. Again assuming that whoever is be root, you can use the following commands: # chown root:root /etc/ppp/net-chat # chmod 600 /etc/ppp/net-chat 1 2 3 next › last » ______________________ Login to save this as favorite del.icio.us Digg Facebook Reddit SlashDot StumbleUpon Post to Twitter Comments Comment viewing options Select your preferred way to display the comments and click &quot;Save settings&quot; to activate your changes. regarding GPRS modem connection and ppp link Anonymous's picture Submitted by Anonymous (not verified) on Sun, 09/28/2008 - 12:15.

The idea of using commodity x86 hardware and replacing it every three years is an outdated cost model. It doesn’t consider the total cost of ownership, and it doesn’t consider the advantage of real processing power, high-availability and multithreading like a demon. This ebook takes a look at some of the practical applications of the Linux on Power platform and ways you might bring all the performance power of this open architecture to bear for your organization. There are no smoke and mirrors here—just hard, cold, empirical evidence provided by independent sources. I also consider some innovative ways Linux on Power will be used in the future.

                   NS1:content=" Blog About GitHub Twitter Instagram 500px DavidMaitland.me Photography, Code &amp; Linux Raspberry Pi Zero Headless Setup 01 Dec 2015 raspberry-pi-zero-otg So last Thursday (26th Nov 2015) the Raspberry Pi Zero was announced and made available that very day. Basically the Zero is a small and ultra cheap (£4) fully functioning Raspberry Pi, but it doesn't have any native networking and has only one USB port (which you need an OTG adapter to use). In the UK I was lucky enough to be able to order two Pi Zero's and have them delivered the next day. The only problem was I didn't have an HDMI monitor or a USB hub to connect a keyboard and a WiFi adapter at the same time. My intended use for the Zero's is for them to be little headless Linux boxes that I can put into various electronic projects and program them over WiFi (Think IoT), so I didn't want to mess around with HDMI and GUI interfaces. So here is a little guide showing you how to setup a Raspberry Pi Zero without an HDMI monitor or a keyboard / mouse. We will just use a USB WiFi adapter (connected to the OTG USB port) and a Linux machine to do the setup. If you don't have a Linux machine available, you could even use another Rasberry Pi with a card reader to set this up. This should be possible to do on other platforms as well but you will need to be able to mount an Ext4 partition natively. Step One - Install the Linux image First you will need to install a copy of Raspbian Jessie onto your micro SD card. You can find the downloads here and the installation guides are on the same page as well. For Linux I will be using this guide. Step Two - Mounting it locally After you have copied the Raspbian image onto the SD card you will need to mount it to your system. The easiest way to do this is just unplug your card reader and plug it back in. Once the drive has mounted to your system you will need to find where it has mounted. An easy way to do this is using the command df -h. For example for me it returns: Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on /dev/mapper/fedora_dhcppc8-root 25G 9.8G 14G 43% / /dev/sda1 477M 258M 190M 58% /boot /dev/mapper/fedora_dhcppc8-home 85G 24G 58G 29% /home /dev/sdc1 60M 20M 41M 34% /run/media/davidmaitland/boot /dev/sdc2 59G 3.4G 53G 6% /run/media/davidmaitland/ad6203a1-ec50-4f44-a1c0-e6c3dd4c9202 I can see from this my 64GB SD card is the device /dev/sdc and the boot and main partition are mounted under /run/media/davidmaitland/. Change directory into the main partition as root ready to edit the files. This is likely to be the same drive that was referenced during the image installation earlier. [user@linux ~]# sudo su [root@linux ~]# cd /run/media/davidmaitland/ad6203a1-ec50-4f44-a1c0-e6c3dd4c9202 [root@linux ad6203a1-ec50-4f44-a1c0-e6c3dd4c9202]# ls bin boot boot.bak dev etc home lib lost+found media mnt opt proc root run sbin srv sys tmp usr var Step Three - Configure your WiFi Next we're going to configure the network interface. Edit the interfaces file etc/network/interfaces. Pay attention to the path in the files I reference, there is no leading slash as you want to edit the files on your SD card and not the ones on your host system! If you're not sure how to edit files on Linux, try nano etc/network/interfaces then Ctrl + x to save when done. Find this block in the file: allow-hotplug wlan0 iface wlan0 inet manual wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf Then change it to this: auto wlan0 allow-hotplug wlan0 iface wlan0 inet dhcp wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf If you want to have a static IP instead of using DHCP (easier to find once the Pi has come up on your network) then change it to this instead: auto wlan0 allow-hotplug wlan0 iface wlan0 inet static address 192.168.1.20 # IP for the Zero netmask 255.255.255.0 gateway 192.168.1.1 # Your router IP wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf As pointed out by someone on Reddit, if you're using static networking you will want to setup your DNS servers as well. Edit etc/resolv.conf and add the following: # Google's public DNS servers nameserver 8.8.8.8 nameserver 8.8.4.4 Now let's setup the WiFi connection and passkey. Edit the file etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf. Add this to the end: network={ ssid=&quot;my network name&quot; psk=&quot;my network password&quot; proto=RSN key_mgmt=WPA-PSK pairwise=CCMP auth_alg=OPEN } Finally remove the SD card from your computer (you may wish to unmount it first) and place into your Zero. Step Four - Boot the Pi Zero! Now it's time to boot the Raspberry Pi Zero. Make sure you have your WiFi adapter plugged into the Zero and give it some power. For me it takes about 45 seconds to boot and connect to my WiFi network. Now you can SSH directly into your Raspberry Pi Zero! If you configured your Zero to use DHCP you will need to find it's IP address. There are a few ways you can do this: Most routers will tell you somewhere in their web interfaces what IP allocations they have assigned to devices. You could use nmap to scan the local network for devices running with port 22 open sudo nmap -p22 -sV 192.168.0.0/24. From the comments Coder-256 pointed out the default hostname for a Raspberry Pi is raspberrypi and on most networks you can SSH directly to this instead of the IP address ssh pi@raspberrypi.local. The default password is raspberry. [user@linux ~]# ssh pi@192.168.1.20 pi@raspberrypi:~ $ Extras After a new install there are a few things you're probably going to want to do. First I would update the software running on your Zero: sudo apt-get update -y sudo apt-get upgrade -y If you're going to be using your Zero completely headlessly like me there are various things you can do to save energy and speed up the device. Boot up into multi-user mode (disable GUI on boot) sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target. To disable HDMI edit /etc/rc.local and add the following line at the bottom above exit 0 line: /usr/bin/tvservice -o You may want to run sudo raspi-config to change other common Raspberry Pi settings as well.

Disabling unused services will limit the needed resources and power. So you'll have more spare computing power for other stuff, and use less electricity at the same time. see more 2 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar Jakub Kramarz ben • 7 months ago Yes and no in the same time: it won't affect CPU performance in any matter, but if you're using VideoCore IV for computation (very unlikely), you may have more resources available. see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar Joel Auterson • 7 months ago Thanks for this - not having a USB keyboard to hand was the reason I'd held back on buying one of these! see more 3 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar Roman • 6 months ago FWIW: this didn't work for me right away, so I went on to debug wpa_supplicant and found that it didn't like the spaces in the line &quot;network={&quot;.

Thank you for posting. see more 1 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar Erwin • 6 months ago Like Tom, I only see with df -h the boot partition (under /Volumes, not /run/media). I must say I try this under OSX (10.11.2). Does df -h or mounting work differently on a Mac? I used the jessie lite image. see more 1 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar David Maitland Mod Erwin • 6 months ago This won't work on Mac by default as you can't mount ext4 partitions. You may be able to use something like this http://osxdaily.com/2014/03/20... or use Virtualbox to spin up a Linux instance. see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar ivow David Maitland • 19 days ago Thanks David. Ubuntu in Virtual Box did the trick on OSX. see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar Morris Singer David Maitland • a month ago Just a note to say I was able to do it on my Mac, but there were a few twists and turns that may put this out of the realm of some of those who will make the attempt. First, when using dd, it's important to note that on OS X, you can only specify the block size in bytes (so, make it 4*2^20, i.e., (4194304) rather than 4M. Second, as David Maitland correctly points out, because OS X does not support mounting ext4 partitions, only the boot partition (which is FAT) will load correctly. You can get around this by running a Linux distro (I ran Ubuntu) inside of a hypervisor and exposing the SD card reader to the guest. Instructions are detailed here for VirtualBox: http://superuser.com/questions.... I ran Ubuntu in VirtualBox with a head, and as a result, Ubuntu took care of actually mounting both of the SD card's partitions automatically, so I could fire up my Ubuntu VM and continue setting up the WiFi. YMMV. see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar Chris Ward • 7 months ago I never thought of mounting it to make changes before plugging it in. Good idea. For the name servers, maybe mention that those are googles servers. How did you get the image to have the whole card usable? I have had to boot my Pi, then expand the file system from the 4gig images up to size of card. see more 1 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar David Maitland Mod Chris Ward • 7 months ago Thanks! I may do, I did add that bit in after someone on Reddit complained about not showing how to add the name servers so was a quick addition. I got the image to use the whole card after I booted the Zero for the first time using the raspi-config command. I'm not sure of another way to do it. see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar Chris Ward David Maitland • 7 months ago Oh. I will have to try that. I was messing with parted and ex2fs to drop, then recreate the partition, then expand the file system. I figured that the hard was was the linux way ;-) see more 1 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar Kevin M David Maitland • 6 months ago I use ubuntu to dd 8G partions to new sd cards. I then use gparted to expand the EXT4 partion to fill the sdcard. I've only tried this with an rpi2-ubuntu image, so I'm not sure if it works for raspian also. see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar cyberspice • 7 months ago I would enable the serial getty. Easy to just connect a serial terminal to it if everything else fails. see more 1 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar Kiran Koduru • 7 months ago Thanks for your article.

Thanks. see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar David Maitland Mod the way of the future • 20 days ago Yes it can. You just need to attach the USB card reader as a device to the VM. see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar the way of the future David Maitland • 19 days ago Thanks I am a total noob to linux and RPI. I get 'could not resolve hostname' or 'connection timed out' when sshing. When I plug in the card to the usb port, 3 things show up on the ubuntu files menu with eject icons; there is 'boot', 'root' and 'settings'. 'Settings' also has a wpa_supplicant.conf file I noticed. Should this one be changed also? It doesn't have the code block from the instructions. I found the main partition to be /media/lerigalacticon/root#. This is the content of my interfaces file after the change: # interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8) # Please note that this file is written to be used with dhcpcd # For static IP, consult /etc/dhcpd.conf and 'man dhcpcd.conf' # Include files from /etc/network/interfaces.d: source-directory /etc/network/interfaces.d auto lo iface lo inet loopback iface eth0 inet manual auto wlan0 allow-hotplug wlan0 iface wlan0 inet dhcp wpa-conf etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf allow-hotplug wlan1 iface wlan1 inet manual wpa-conf etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf Could you give some advice as to how to get ssh working for me?

I am quite new to Raspberry Pi and the Linux interface, therefore I had some problem figuring out what you meant in the beginning of step three with the leading forward slash. Since I chose to configure the SD card with another RPI I had to add a forward slash. But it was great fun with a little bit of challenge, thank you! see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar David Maitland Mod Wilhelm Råbergh • 20 days ago Did this work? You might have just changed the settings on your existing raspberry pi :/ see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar Wilhelm Råbergh David Maitland • 20 days ago Yes that's probably true, forgot to mention that I swapped cards. I put the new SD card in my RPI 3, did the configurations in your guide and then removed the SD card and put it in the Pi Zero. Maybe that explains it better? :) see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar Scott Kosman • a month ago Thanks so much for this guide, the step-by-step descriptions worked perfectly for me! One addition: I'm using the same WiFi dongle as you (Edimax EW-7811UN) and after I got it running I found that the wifi connection would drop out after about 30 seconds of idleness. Turns out that I had to disable power management on the dongle itself to keep the connection alive, which is very simple to do: Create a new empty file: sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/8192cu.conf Paste the following into it: options 8192cu rtw_power_mgnt=0 rtw_enusbss=0 Reboot. Done! No more wifi problems. see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar David Maitland Mod Scott Kosman • 20 days ago Interesting, haven't had this issue before. I wonder how much it increases the power usage of the Pi. see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar Scott Kosman David Maitland • 20 days ago Good question, I'm not sure how to even check that (I'm by no means an expert here – I found the above directions elsewhere after Googling the problem). I'm running mine in headless mode as well, though, so no HDMI port use or GUI so I'm not terribly concerned about power usage at this point. see more 0 • Reply • Share › Twitter Facebook Link − + Avatar wireddude • 5 months ago I'm able to get everything working up to the final step.

Wvdial is mainly used to configure the dialup settings. For setting up various settings for PPP connection and establishing a data connection on these capes follow the link to the wiki Way to setup the Vayu 2G Capes How to read location and coarse time as NMEA-0183 message from the serial UART ttyO4 port How to write wvdial conf files for any network Sample wvdial.conf file for AT&amp;T and T-Mobile USA For using the Vayu-3G-A/Vayu-3GP-A Cape, please ensure that you have the following : USB drivers for the modem (21f5:2012) installed in kernel PPS drivers enabled in kernel, required if GPS module is present. VAYU Device tree overlay file is properly configured. You can either download kernel patches containing the same to use with your existing images or you can download our prebuilt MicroSD card image or EMMC flasher image. All the images and files and extra support on software can be found here: Vayu_Cape_SW_images_and_drivers Note : On most beaglebones, there is a known bug with USB hotplug for using USB HUB with Beaglebone black host port. So to efficiently be able to use the modem, follow the Power on Modem section properly. An alternative easier approach is to keep the second host port on cape populated with a usb device. Hardware Configurations The 3G/WCDMA modem has following interfaces available on the Cape: Leaflet_3G modem Mini USB B Device port on Cape (P9): It has to be connected to USB host port on Beaglebone Black. SMA connector for GSM/WCDMA antenna(P7): Antenna is connected here. LED D2 (5V Power LED of Cape) : This LED indicates that the Cape is powered on with 5V and GSM/WCDMA modem is also powered. LED D4 (SIGNAL LED) : This LED is the SIGNAL LED for the GSM/WCDMA modem whose various blinking states denote the different states of the WCDMA Modem. GPIO45 (ON/OFF PIN) : It is the GPIO connected to Power ON/OFF pin of GSM/WCDMA Modem. GPIO60 (Hard Reset Pin) : It is the GPIO connected to Reset pin of GSM/WCDMA Modem. S1 (ON/OFF switch) : This push button switch is connected to Power ON/OFF pin of GSM/WCDMA modem. S2 (RESET switch) : This push button switch is connected to Hard Reset pin of GSM/WCDMA modem. GPIO45 and GPIO60 should be set high at all instances for the GSM/WCDMA modem to be available for use. USB drivers for the modem (21f5:2012, 21f5:2009) should be included in the kernel. We provide pre-compiled images with USB drivers included in the kernel. Getting started Seting up the system Sim Card and Antennae 1. Place a mini sim in the sim card slot and connect a GSM antenna to the SMA connector. 2. Mount the cape on BBB carefully. 3. Connect the extra usb cable provided with the cape between Host port on Beaglebone Black and miniUSB device port on Cape. 4. To avoid the bug on Beaglebone black with external USB hubs, please connect a USB device (pendrive etc) to extra host port on the cape. 5. Ensuring that the power jumper on the cape is in its place, power up the setup using a 5V DC adapter(min 2.5A) to barrel jack. D2 LED on the cape will glow alongwith LEDs on the Beaglebone black. Note : Before proceeding further ensure D2 LED is glowing properly. Make sure that the adapter being used is of proper rating and has been connected properly. Further check for the presence of the power jumper(#12 on leaflet). Note : Do not try to power up using USB cable alone. Always power up system with a DC adapter. Also while disconnecting power, USB cable should be removed before the DC adapter. Hardware setup Check.jpg Usb.jpg Final.jpg USB ports and power jumper on the cape USB connections on cape and beaglebone black Final setup before login Ways to log into the cape After establishing that the power on the cape is proper, log in to the BBB plus cape setup using any of the following method : 1. Through USB client. 2. Through Ethernet cable. Now login by using the SSH command. Make sure to login as root only so that all the special priviledges are available. 1. Through USB client. Use the command : ssh -l root 192.168.7.2 to login onto the system. Default password is root. 2. Through ethernet cable. The ip address of the ethernet cable should be known. Use that with the ssh command to esatblish a connection : ssh -l root $address Default Username and password is root. In Yantrr Precompiled images, IP address is 192.168.1.150 After logging into the BBB plus cape system, export and set the GPIO45 and GPIO60 high by using: cd /sys/class/gpio/ echo 45 &gt; export echo 60 &gt; export cd gpio45 echo “high” &gt; direction cd .. cd gpio60 echo “high” &gt; direction NOTE : In precompiled image, for ease of use these regular commands for use with the GPIOs have been created as functions : pinexp, setout, setin, pinread. pinexp 45 pinexp 60 setout 45 high setout 60 high Power On Modem The Modem can be powered on by providing a low level pulse at ON/OFF Pin for 3-4s when the module is off. It can be achieved by either using the push button switch S1 or GPIO45. cd /sys/class/gpio/ echo 45 &gt; export cd gpio45 echo &quot;high&quot; &gt; direction sleep 4 echo &quot;low&quot; &gt; direction sleep 4 echo &quot;high&quot; &gt; direction After some time, LED D4 should start blinking as to indicate modem has turned on. (Note : In some of 3G modules LED functionality is not enabled by the manufacturer, so the LED D4 might not blink) Note : In cases where a usb device was not connected to extra host port on cape, please connect the provided USB cable after turning on the modem.

The generic driver is not reliable. Note : If the modem is not visible after these steps or any issues are faced while initializing the modem please contact Yantrr Support (support@yantrr.com) with the above log messages (dmesg | grep –I usb or /var/log/syslog). Understanding the TTYUSB ports on BBB capes Vayu 3G cape enumerate 3 different usb ports /dev/ttyUSB0 /dev/ttyUSB1 /dev/ttyUSB2 ttyUSB0 is data port &amp; command for modem, use this for the WVDIAL conf or PPP ttyUSB1 is the diag port for the Firmware upgrade ttyUSB2 is the AT CMD port only. Note : These ttyUSB ports are only created if proper drivers are present or when “modprobe usbserial” command is issued. Pre compiled images with drivers are available on the Yantrr wiki page. Note : Both ttyUSB0 and ttyUSB2 take the AT commands, but ttyUSB0 port is also a Data communications port so for all intended purposes of issuing AT commands use ttyUSB2 port(PCUI port). Power Off Modem The modem can be powered off by providing a low level pulse at ON/OFF pin for 3-4s when the module is On. It can be achieved by either using the push button switch S1 or GPIO45. cd /sys/class/gpio/ echo 45 &gt; export cd gpio45 echo &quot;high&quot; &gt; direction sleep 4 echo &quot;low&quot; &gt; direction sleep 4 echo &quot;high&quot; &gt; direction Modem can also be turned off by issuing following AT commands on port /dev/ttyUSB2 AT+ZPWROFF Soft Resetting the Modem Steps - Power Off the Modem. Wait for 1-2s atleast. Power on the modem. Hard resetting the modem There might arise situations where modem does not seem to be responding to any commands issued on AT commands port or it cannot be turned on/off. In such scenarios, issue hard reset to the modem. It can be done by either toggling Switch S2 for atleast 100ms or pulling GPIO60 low for 1s and then setting it high again. cd /sys/class/gpio/ cd gpio60 echo &quot;low&quot; &gt; direction sleep 1 echo &quot;high&quot; &gt; direction Note : Please use hard reset conservatively. Soft reset should be preferred under most conditions. VAYU 3GHx-D(ZTE Modem) VAYU 3GHx-D capes have ZTE MG3732 modem. Their functionality is essentially the same with some minor changes. For more information on ZTE MG3732 modem and a quick reference guide click here AT Commands Manual The AT Command for the 3G Module can be downloaded from here : WCDMA AT Commands Manual FAQ FAQ for this section click here Data connection procedure using PPP Notes All commands are recommended to executed as root user. USB drivers need to be installed in the kernel for the WCDMA modem to work. Modem port for Vayu cape is ttyUSB0, use this port for PPPd or Wvdial AT Commands port for Vayu cape is ttyUSB2 Wvdial Configuration for Debian Wheezy Download and install Wvdial apt-get install wvdial Executing the following command usually sets the wvdial.conf file which is used for dialing to GPRS communication, but since here our modem port is on a UART(/dev/ttyO1) and not on /dev/ttyS* or /dev/ttyUSB* ports, we will have to manually configure it. So, open the wvdial.conf file $ nano /etc/wvdial.conf Assuming that you have the USERNAME, PASSWORD and APN available for the service provider of the sim card being used, edit and make wvdial.conf file like this. Sample wvdial.conf file for AT&amp;T and T-Mobile USA [Dialer Defaults] Modem Type = Analog ModemPhone = *99# ISDN = 0 Baud = 115200 Username = USERNAME Password = PASSWORD Modem = /dev/ttyUSB0 Init1 = ATZ Init2 = ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &amp;C1 &amp;D2 +FCLASS=0 Init3 = at+cgdcont=1,&quot;ip&quot;,&quot;APN&quot; Stupid Mode = 1 Usually for GSM Networks, Modemphone is *99# or *99***1#. Consult your network provider for exact details in case you are facing difficulties. After editing, save and exit, now run wvdial for establishing communication. $ wvdial If all parameters are correct and everything is working, you should see a success message from wvdial. Once PPP connection has been established, you will see a ppp0 IP. To check the status of wvdial and find out its IP open a new shell and use either of following: Run ifconfig and find ppp0 in the list of network connections. $ ifconfig or $ ifconfig ppp0 Check the network statistics for IP and their gateways and check the Iface column for ppp0 $ netstat -arn * Kernel IP routing table Destination Gateway Genmask Flags MSS Window irtt Iface 0.0.0.0 192.168.1.1 0.0.0.0 UG 0 0 0 eth0 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 U 0 0 0 eth0 192.168.7.0 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.252 U 0 0 0 usb0 192.200.1.21 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 UH 0 0 0 ppp0 Read the system messages as $ cat /var/log/messages It lists all the attempts at establishing ppp communication using the modem and IPs for the successful attempt. Now all that is left is to route the network traffic over the gateway of ppp0 instead of eth0 so that GPRS communication is fully completed. PPP connection has been established over GPRS using 2G/3G module and wvdial. System Status After PPP has been established, the following is the status of the LEDs and GPIOs (For verification) STATUS LED D3 – It is continuously glowing, once the Modem was turned on. SIGNAL LED D4 – It is now blinking at 64ms ON/300ms OFF . Earlier when PPP was not established but SIMcard was detected by modem, then it was blinking at 64ms ON/3000ms OFF. ON/OFF GPIO45 – Its value should be 1. RESET GPIO60 – Its value should always be 1.

Using GPS module with Debian Wheezy Please refer to Software startup Guide for VAYU GPS FAQ FAQ 1: Modem / TTYUSB of modem not detected Solution 1. Remove the power cord from the board and reconnect it while the USB cable is not connected to the cape. Then you should follow the procedure to turn on the 3G module as follows set GPIO 45 to high in output mode Then after 3-4s , either press the switch S1 for 4s and then release it or instead of switch you can also recycle the value of GPIO 45 to low then high at intervals of 4s and now connect the USB cable. ** Always make sure GPIO 45 is in HIGH state ** cd /sys/class/gpio/ echo 45 &gt; export cd gpio45 echo &quot;high&quot; &gt; direction sleep 4 **Now enable the modem by toggling GPIO 45 *** echo &quot;low&quot; &gt; direction sleep 4 echo &quot;high&quot; &gt; direction sleep 4 ** To disable the Modem, again toggle GPIO45 ** echo &quot;low&quot; &gt; direction sleep 4 echo &quot;high&quot; &gt; direction sleep 4 Solution 2. Due to hotplug issue in AM335x we can do a workaround, connect a usb device like a pendrive on second host port on cape and then just press the switch S1 for 4s after setting GPIO45 high. This will most certainly work. Solution 3. This solution resets the usbcore of the AM335x and reinitialize it. This has been identified as a last resort workaround, NOTE, this will reset all peripheral on that USB CORE If the Device is disconnecting as soon as you try to establish connection even when you are sure that 3G module is on, then following should be followed : reset the USB1 echo 0 &gt; /sys/bus/usb/devices/usb1/bConfigurationValue echo 1 &gt; /sys/bus/usb/devices/usb1/bConfigurationValue Retrieved from &quot;http://www.yantrr.com/w/index.php?title=SW_startup_guide_for_Vayu_3G&amp;oldid=669&quot; Personal tools Log in Namespaces Page Discussion Variants Views Read View source View history Actions Search Navigation Main page Recent changes Random page Yantrr Links BeagleBone M2M Cape Order Capes Tools What links here Related changes Special pages Printable version Permanent link This page was last modified on 21 July 2015, at 11:17.

                   NS1:content=" Navigation index modules | next | previous | Python » Documentation » Python HOWTOs » HOWTO Fetch Internet Resources Using urllib2¶ Author: Michael Foord Note There is a French translation of an earlier revision of this HOWTO, available at urllib2 - Le Manuel manquant. Introduction¶ Related Articles You may also find useful the following article on fetching web resources with Python: Basic Authentication A tutorial on Basic Authentication, with examples in Python. urllib2 is a Python module for fetching URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). It offers a very simple interface, in the form of the urlopen function. This is capable of fetching URLs using a variety of different protocols. It also offers a slightly more complex interface for handling common situations - like basic authentication, cookies, proxies and so on. These are provided by objects called handlers and openers. urllib2 supports fetching URLs for many “URL schemes” (identified by the string before the ”:” in URL - for example “ftp” is the URL scheme of “ftp://python.org/”) using their associated network protocols (e.g. FTP, HTTP). This tutorial focuses on the most common case, HTTP. For straightforward situations urlopen is very easy to use. But as soon as you encounter errors or non-trivial cases when opening HTTP URLs, you will need some understanding of the HyperText Transfer Protocol. The most comprehensive and authoritative reference to HTTP is RFC 2616. This is a technical document and not intended to be easy to read. This HOWTO aims to illustrate using urllib2, with enough detail about HTTP to help you through. It is not intended to replace the urllib2 docs, but is supplementary to them. Fetching URLs¶ The simplest way to use urllib2 is as follows: import urllib2 response = urllib2.urlopen('http://python.org/') html = response.read() Many uses of urllib2 will be that simple (note that instead of an ‘http:’ URL we could have used a URL starting with ‘ftp:’, ‘file:’, etc.). However, it’s the purpose of this tutorial to explain the more complicated cases, concentrating on HTTP. HTTP is based on requests and responses - the client makes requests and servers send responses. urllib2 mirrors this with a Request object which represents the HTTP request you are making. In its simplest form you create a Request object that specifies the URL you want to fetch. Calling urlopen with this Request object returns a response object for the URL requested. This response is a file-like object, which means you can for example call .read() on the response: import urllib2 req = urllib2.Request('http://www.voidspace.org.uk') response = urllib2.urlopen(req) the_page = response.read() Note that urllib2 makes use of the same Request interface to handle all URL schemes. For example, you can make an FTP request like so: req = urllib2.Request('ftp://example.com/') In the case of HTTP, there are two extra things that Request objects allow you to do: First, you can pass data to be sent to the server. Second, you can pass extra information (“metadata”) about the data or the about request itself, to the server - this information is sent as HTTP “headers”. Let’s look at each of these in turn. Data¶ Sometimes you want to send data to a URL (often the URL will refer to a CGI (Common Gateway Interface) script [1] or other web application). With HTTP, this is often done using what’s known as a POST request. This is often what your browser does when you submit a HTML form that you filled in on the web. Not all POSTs have to come from forms: you can use a POST to transmit arbitrary data to your own application. In the common case of HTML forms, the data needs to be encoded in a standard way, and then passed to the Request object as the data argument. The encoding is done using a function from the urllib library not from urllib2. import urllib import urllib2 url = 'http://www.someserver.com/cgi-bin/register.cgi' values = {'name' : 'Michael Foord', 'location' : 'Northampton', 'language' : 'Python' } data = urllib.urlencode(values) req = urllib2.Request(url, data) response = urllib2.urlopen(req) the_page = response.read() Note that other encodings are sometimes required (e.g. for file upload from HTML forms - see HTML Specification, Form Submission for more details). If you do not pass the data argument, urllib2 uses a GET request. One way in which GET and POST requests differ is that POST requests often have “side-effects”: they change the state of the system in some way (for example by placing an order with the website for a hundredweight of tinned spam to be delivered to your door). Though the HTTP standard makes it clear that POSTs are intended to always cause side-effects, and GET requests never to cause side-effects, nothing prevents a GET request from having side-effects, nor a POST requests from having no side-effects. Data can also be passed in an HTTP GET request by encoding it in the URL itself. This is done as follows: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; import urllib2 &gt;&gt;&gt; import urllib &gt;&gt;&gt; data = {} &gt;&gt;&gt; data['name'] = 'Somebody Here' &gt;&gt;&gt; data['location'] = 'Northampton' &gt;&gt;&gt; data['language'] = 'Python' &gt;&gt;&gt; url_values = urllib.urlencode(data) &gt;&gt;&gt; print url_values # The order may differ. name=Somebody+Here&amp;language=Python&amp;location=Northampton &gt;&gt;&gt; url = 'http://www.example.com/example.cgi' &gt;&gt;&gt; full_url = url + '?' + url_values &gt;&gt;&gt; data = urllib2.urlopen(full_url) Notice that the full URL is created by adding a ? to the URL, followed by the encoded values. Headers¶ We’ll discuss here one particular HTTP header, to illustrate how to add headers to your HTTP request. Some websites [2] dislike being browsed by programs, or send different versions to different browsers [3]. By default urllib2 identifies itself as Python-urllib/x.y (where x and y are the major and minor version numbers of the Python release, e.g. Python-urllib/2.5), which may confuse the site, or just plain not work. The way a browser identifies itself is through the User-Agent header [4]. When you create a Request object you can pass a dictionary of headers in. The following example makes the same request as above, but identifies itself as a version of Internet Explorer [5]. import urllib import urllib2 url = 'http://www.someserver.com/cgi-bin/register.cgi' user_agent = 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64)' values = {'name': 'Michael Foord', 'location': 'Northampton', 'language': 'Python' } headers = {'User-Agent': user_agent} data = urllib.urlencode(values) req = urllib2.Request(url, data, headers) response = urllib2.urlopen(req) the_page = response.read() The response also has two useful methods. See the section on info and geturl which comes after we have a look at what happens when things go wrong. Handling Exceptions¶ urlopen raises URLError when it cannot handle a response (though as usual with Python APIs, built-in exceptions such as ValueError, TypeError etc. may also be raised). HTTPError is the subclass of URLError raised in the specific case of HTTP URLs. URLError¶ Often, URLError is raised because there is no network connection (no route to the specified server), or the specified server doesn’t exist. In this case, the exception raised will have a ‘reason’ attribute, which is a tuple containing an error code and a text error message. e.g. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; req = urllib2.Request('http://www.pretend_server.org') &gt;&gt;&gt; try: urllib2.urlopen(req) ... except URLError as e: ... print e.reason ... (4, 'getaddrinfo failed') HTTPError¶ Every HTTP response from the server contains a numeric “status code”. Sometimes the status code indicates that the server is unable to fulfil the request. The default handlers will handle some of these responses for you (for example, if the response is a “redirection” that requests the client fetch the document from a different URL, urllib2 will handle that for you). For those it can’t handle, urlopen will raise an HTTPError. Typical errors include ‘404’ (page not found), ‘403’ (request forbidden), and ‘401’ (authentication required). See section 10 of RFC 2616 for a reference on all the HTTP error codes. The HTTPError instance raised will have an integer ‘code’ attribute, which corresponds to the error sent by the server. Error Codes¶ Because the default handlers handle redirects (codes in the 300 range), and codes in the 100-299 range indicate success, you will usually only see error codes in the 400-599 range. BaseHTTPServer.BaseHTTPRequestHandler.responses is a useful dictionary of response codes in that shows all the response codes used by RFC 2616. The dictionary is reproduced here for convenience # Table mapping response codes to messages; entries have the # form {code: (shortmessage, longmessage)}. responses = { 100: ('Continue', 'Request received, please continue'), 101: ('Switching Protocols', 'Switching to new protocol; obey Upgrade header'), 200: ('OK', 'Request fulfilled, document follows'), 201: ('Created', 'Document created, URL follows'), 202: ('Accepted', 'Request accepted, processing continues off-line'), 203: ('Non-Authoritative Information', 'Request fulfilled from cache'), 204: ('No Content', 'Request fulfilled, nothing follows'), 205: ('Reset Content', 'Clear input form for further input.'), 206: ('Partial Content', 'Partial content follows.'), 300: ('Multiple Choices', 'Object has several resources -- see URI list'), 301: ('Moved Permanently', 'Object moved permanently -- see URI list'), 302: ('Found', 'Object moved temporarily -- see URI list'), 303: ('See Other', 'Object moved -- see Method and URL list'), 304: ('Not Modified', 'Document has not changed since given time'), 305: ('Use Proxy', 'You must use proxy specified in Location to access this ' 'resource.'), 307: ('Temporary Redirect', 'Object moved temporarily -- see URI list'), 400: ('Bad Request', 'Bad request syntax or unsupported method'), 401: ('Unauthorized', 'No permission -- see authorization schemes'), 402: ('Payment Required', 'No payment -- see charging schemes'), 403: ('Forbidden', 'Request forbidden -- authorization will not help'), 404: ('Not Found', 'Nothing matches the given URI'), 405: ('Method Not Allowed', 'Specified method is invalid for this server.'), 406: ('Not Acceptable', 'URI not available in preferred format.'), 407: ('Proxy Authentication Required', 'You must authenticate with ' 'this proxy before proceeding.'), 408: ('Request Timeout', 'Request timed out; try again later.'), 409: ('Conflict', 'Request conflict.'), 410: ('Gone', 'URI no longer exists and has been permanently removed.'), 411: ('Length Required', 'Client must specify Content-Length.'), 412: ('Precondition Failed', 'Precondition in headers is false.'), 413: ('Request Entity Too Large', 'Entity is too large.'), 414: ('Request-URI Too Long', 'URI is too long.'), 415: ('Unsupported Media Type', 'Entity body in unsupported format.'), 416: ('Requested Range Not Satisfiable', 'Cannot satisfy request range.'), 417: ('Expectation Failed', 'Expect condition could not be satisfied.'), 500: ('Internal Server Error', 'Server got itself in trouble'), 501: ('Not Implemented', 'Server does not support this operation'), 502: ('Bad Gateway', 'Invalid responses from another server/proxy.'), 503: ('Service Unavailable', 'The server cannot process the request due to a high load'), 504: ('Gateway Timeout', 'The gateway server did not receive a timely response'), 505: ('HTTP Version Not Supported', 'Cannot fulfill request.'), } When an error is raised the server responds by returning an HTTP error code and an error page. You can use the HTTPError instance as a response on the page returned. This means that as well as the code attribute, it also has read, geturl, and info, methods. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; req = urllib2.Request('http://www.python.org/fish.html') &gt;&gt;&gt; try: ... urllib2.urlopen(req) ... except urllib2.HTTPError as e: ... print e.code ... print e.read() ... 404 &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd&quot;&gt; ... &lt;title&gt;Page Not Found&lt;/title&gt; ... Wrapping it Up¶ So if you want to be prepared for HTTPError or URLError there are two basic approaches. I prefer the second approach. Number 1¶ from urllib2 import Request, urlopen, URLError, HTTPError req = Request(someurl) try: response = urlopen(req) except HTTPError as e: print 'The server couldn\'t fulfill the request.' print 'Error code: ', e.code except URLError as e: print 'We failed to reach a server.' print 'Reason: ', e.reason else: # everything is fine Note The except HTTPError must come first, otherwise except URLError will also catch an HTTPError. Number 2¶ from urllib2 import Request, urlopen, URLError req = Request(someurl) try: response = urlopen(req) except URLError as e: if hasattr(e, 'reason'): print 'We failed to reach a server.' print 'Reason: ', e.reason elif hasattr(e, 'code'): print 'The server couldn\'t fulfill the request.' print 'Error code: ', e.code else: # everything is fine info and geturl¶ The response returned by urlopen (or the HTTPError instance) has two useful methods info() and geturl(). geturl - this returns the real URL of the page fetched. This is useful because urlopen (or the opener object used) may have followed a redirect. The URL of the page fetched may not be the same as the URL requested. info - this returns a dictionary-like object that describes the page fetched, particularly the headers sent by the server. It is currently an httplib.HTTPMessage instance. Typical headers include ‘Content-length’, ‘Content-type’, and so on. See the Quick Reference to HTTP Headers for a useful listing of HTTP headers with brief explanations of their meaning and use. Openers and Handlers¶ When you fetch a URL you use an opener (an instance of the perhaps confusingly-named urllib2.OpenerDirector). Normally we have been using the default opener - via urlopen - but you can create custom openers. Openers use handlers. All the “heavy lifting” is done by the handlers. Each handler knows how to open URLs for a particular URL scheme (http, ftp, etc.), or how to handle an aspect of URL opening, for example HTTP redirections or HTTP cookies. You will want to create openers if you want to fetch URLs with specific handlers installed, for example to get an opener that handles cookies, or to get an opener that does not handle redirections. To create an opener, instantiate an OpenerDirector, and then call .add_handler(some_handler_instance) repeatedly. Alternatively, you can use build_opener, which is a convenience function for creating opener objects with a single function call. build_opener adds several handlers by default, but provides a quick way to add more and/or override the default handlers. Other sorts of handlers you might want to can handle proxies, authentication, and other common but slightly specialised situations. install_opener can be used to make an opener object the (global) default opener. This means that calls to urlopen will use the opener you have installed. Opener objects have an open method, which can be called directly to fetch urls in the same way as the urlopen function: there’s no need to call install_opener, except as a convenience. Basic Authentication¶ To illustrate creating and installing a handler we will use the HTTPBasicAuthHandler. For a more detailed discussion of this subject – including an explanation of how Basic Authentication works - see the Basic Authentication Tutorial. When authentication is required, the server sends a header (as well as the 401 error code) requesting authentication. This specifies the authentication scheme and a ‘realm’. The header looks like: WWW-Authenticate: SCHEME realm=&quot;REALM&quot;. e.g. WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm=&quot;cPanel Users&quot; The client should then retry the request with the appropriate name and password for the realm included as a header in the request. This is ‘basic authentication’. In order to simplify this process we can create an instance of HTTPBasicAuthHandler and an opener to use this handler. The HTTPBasicAuthHandler uses an object called a password manager to handle the mapping of URLs and realms to passwords and usernames. If you know what the realm is (from the authentication header sent by the server), then you can use a HTTPPasswordMgr. Frequently one doesn’t care what the realm is. In that case, it is convenient to use HTTPPasswordMgrWithDefaultRealm. This allows you to specify a default username and password for a URL. This will be supplied in the absence of you providing an alternative combination for a specific realm. We indicate this by providing None as the realm argument to the add_password method. The top-level URL is the first URL that requires authentication. URLs “deeper” than the URL you pass to .add_password() will also match. # create a password manager password_mgr = urllib2.HTTPPasswordMgrWithDefaultRealm() # Add the username and password. # If we knew the realm, we could use it instead of None. top_level_url = &quot;http://example.com/foo/&quot; password_mgr.add_password(None, top_level_url, username, password) handler = urllib2.HTTPBasicAuthHandler(password_mgr) # create &quot;opener&quot; (OpenerDirector instance) opener = urllib2.build_opener(handler) # use the opener to fetch a URL opener.open(a_url) # Install the opener. # Now all calls to urllib2.urlopen use our opener. urllib2.install_opener(opener) Note In the above example we only supplied our HTTPBasicAuthHandler to build_opener. By default openers have the handlers for normal situations – ProxyHandler (if a proxy setting such as an http_proxy environment variable is set), UnknownHandler, HTTPHandler, HTTPDefaultErrorHandler, HTTPRedirectHandler, FTPHandler, FileHandler, HTTPErrorProcessor. top_level_url is in fact either a full URL (including the ‘http:’ scheme component and the hostname and optionally the port number) e.g. “http://example.com/” or an “authority” (i.e. the hostname, optionally including the port number) e.g. “example.com” or “example.com:8080” (the latter example includes a port number). The authority, if present, must NOT contain the “userinfo” component - for example “joe:password@example.com” is not correct. Proxies¶ urllib2 will auto-detect your proxy settings and use those. This is through the ProxyHandler, which is part of the normal handler chain when a proxy setting is detected. Normally that’s a good thing, but there are occasions when it may not be helpful [6]. One way to do this is to setup our own ProxyHandler, with no proxies defined. This is done using similar steps to setting up a Basic Authentication handler: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; proxy_support = urllib2.ProxyHandler({}) &gt;&gt;&gt; opener = urllib2.build_opener(proxy_support) &gt;&gt;&gt; urllib2.install_opener(opener) Note Currently urllib2 does not support fetching of https locations through a proxy. However, this can be enabled by extending urllib2 as shown in the recipe [7]. Sockets and Layers¶ The Python support for fetching resources from the web is layered. urllib2 uses the httplib library, which in turn uses the socket library. As of Python 2.3 you can specify how long a socket should wait for a response before timing out. This can be useful in applications which have to fetch web pages. By default the socket module has no timeout and can hang. Currently, the socket timeout is not exposed at the httplib or urllib2 levels. However, you can set the default timeout globally for all sockets using import socket import urllib2 # timeout in seconds timeout = 10 socket.setdefaulttimeout(timeout) # this call to urllib2.urlopen now uses the default timeout # we have set in the socket module req = urllib2.Request('http://www.voidspace.org.uk') response = urllib2.urlopen(req) Footnotes¶ This document was reviewed and revised by John Lee.

Do the same with the other end and then tighten both ends to form the knot. Lanyard (Diamond) Knot Details Name: The Lanyard Knot, also known as the Diamond Knot and Friendship Knot, (ABOK # 787, p 141.) makes a fixed loop in the middle of a piece of rope. Structure: Steps 1 to 6 of the animation show how the ends of the loop are joined together with a Carrick Bend. This pleasingly symmetrical knot forms the center of the Lanyard Knot. Each end is then wrapped around outside the loop and up through the center, away from the loop. The resulting appearance creates the strong impression that the two ropes are passing through a collar. Use: The Lanyard Knot is often used as a decorative component of a Knife Lanyard. Disclaimer: Any activity that involves ropes is potentially hazardous. Lives may be at risk - possibly your own.

                   NS1:content=" Navigation index modules | next | previous | Python » Documentation » The Python Standard Library » 7. String Services » 7.2. re — Regular expression operations¶ This module provides regular expression matching operations similar to those found in Perl. Both patterns and strings to be searched can be Unicode strings as well as 8-bit strings. Regular expressions use the backslash character ('\') to indicate special forms or to allow special characters to be used without invoking their special meaning. This collides with Python’s usage of the same character for the same purpose in string literals; for example, to match a literal backslash, one might have to write '\\\\' as the pattern string, because the regular expression must be \\, and each backslash must be expressed as \\ inside a regular Python string literal. The solution is to use Python’s raw string notation for regular expression patterns; backslashes are not handled in any special way in a string literal prefixed with 'r'. So r&quot;\n&quot; is a two-character string containing '\' and 'n', while &quot;\n&quot; is a one-character string containing a newline. Usually patterns will be expressed in Python code using this raw string notation. It is important to note that most regular expression operations are available as module-level functions and RegexObject methods. The functions are shortcuts that don’t require you to compile a regex object first, but miss some fine-tuning parameters. 7.2.1. Regular Expression Syntax¶ A regular expression (or RE) specifies a set of strings that matches it; the functions in this module let you check if a particular string matches a given regular expression (or if a given regular expression matches a particular string, which comes down to the same thing). Regular expressions can be concatenated to form new regular expressions; if A and B are both regular expressions, then AB is also a regular expression. In general, if a string p matches A and another string q matches B, the string pq will match AB. This holds unless A or B contain low precedence operations; boundary conditions between A and B; or have numbered group references. Thus, complex expressions can easily be constructed from simpler primitive expressions like the ones described here. For details of the theory and implementation of regular expressions, consult the Friedl book referenced above, or almost any textbook about compiler construction. A brief explanation of the format of regular expressions follows. For further information and a gentler presentation, consult the Regular Expression HOWTO. Regular expressions can contain both special and ordinary characters. Most ordinary characters, like 'A', 'a', or '0', are the simplest regular expressions; they simply match themselves. You can concatenate ordinary characters, so last matches the string 'last'. (In the rest of this section, we’ll write RE’s in this special style, usually without quotes, and strings to be matched 'in single quotes'.) Some characters, like '|' or '(', are special. Special characters either stand for classes of ordinary characters, or affect how the regular expressions around them are interpreted. Regular expression pattern strings may not contain null bytes, but can specify the null byte using the \number notation, e.g., '\x00'. The special characters are: '.' (Dot.) In the default mode, this matches any character except a newline. If the DOTALL flag has been specified, this matches any character including a newline. '^' (Caret.) Matches the start of the string, and in MULTILINE mode also matches immediately after each newline. '$' Matches the end of the string or just before the newline at the end of the string, and in MULTILINE mode also matches before a newline. foo matches both ‘foo’ and ‘foobar’, while the regular expression foo$ matches only ‘foo’. More interestingly, searching for foo.$ in 'foo1\nfoo2\n' matches ‘foo2’ normally, but ‘foo1’ in MULTILINE mode; searching for a single $ in 'foo\n' will find two (empty) matches: one just before the newline, and one at the end of the string. '*' Causes the resulting RE to match 0 or more repetitions of the preceding RE, as many repetitions as are possible. ab* will match ‘a’, ‘ab’, or ‘a’ followed by any number of ‘b’s. '+' Causes the resulting RE to match 1 or more repetitions of the preceding RE. ab+ will match ‘a’ followed by any non-zero number of ‘b’s; it will not match just ‘a’. '?' Causes the resulting RE to match 0 or 1 repetitions of the preceding RE. ab? will match either ‘a’ or ‘ab’. *?, +?, ?? The '*', '+', and '?' qualifiers are all greedy; they match as much text as possible. Sometimes this behaviour isn’t desired; if the RE &lt;.*&gt; is matched against &lt;a&gt; b &lt;c&gt;, it will match the entire string, and not just &lt;a&gt;. Adding ? after the qualifier makes it perform the match in non-greedy or minimal fashion; as few characters as possible will be matched. Using the RE &lt;.*?&gt; will match only &lt;a&gt;. {m} Specifies that exactly m copies of the previous RE should be matched; fewer matches cause the entire RE not to match. For example, a{6} will match exactly six 'a' characters, but not five. {m,n} Causes the resulting RE to match from m to n repetitions of the preceding RE, attempting to match as many repetitions as possible. For example, a{3,5} will match from 3 to 5 'a' characters. Omitting m specifies a lower bound of zero, and omitting n specifies an infinite upper bound. As an example, a{4,}b will match aaaab or a thousand 'a' characters followed by a b, but not aaab. The comma may not be omitted or the modifier would be confused with the previously described form. {m,n}? Causes the resulting RE to match from m to n repetitions of the preceding RE, attempting to match as few repetitions as possible. This is the non-greedy version of the previous qualifier. For example, on the 6-character string 'aaaaaa', a{3,5} will match 5 'a' characters, while a{3,5}? will only match 3 characters. '\' Either escapes special characters (permitting you to match characters like '*', '?', and so forth), or signals a special sequence; special sequences are discussed below. If you’re not using a raw string to express the pattern, remember that Python also uses the backslash as an escape sequence in string literals; if the escape sequence isn’t recognized by Python’s parser, the backslash and subsequent character are included in the resulting string. However, if Python would recognize the resulting sequence, the backslash should be repeated twice. This is complicated and hard to understand, so it’s highly recommended that you use raw strings for all but the simplest expressions. [] Used to indicate a set of characters. In a set: Characters can be listed individually, e.g. [amk] will match 'a', 'm', or 'k'. Ranges of characters can be indicated by giving two characters and separating them by a '-', for example [a-z] will match any lowercase ASCII letter, [0-5][0-9] will match all the two-digits numbers from 00 to 59, and [0-9A-Fa-f] will match any hexadecimal digit. If - is escaped (e.g. [a\-z]) or if it’s placed as the first or last character (e.g. [a-]), it will match a literal '-'. Special characters lose their special meaning inside sets. For example, [(+*)] will match any of the literal characters '(', '+', '*', or ')'. Character classes such as \w or \S (defined below) are also accepted inside a set, although the characters they match depends on whether LOCALE or UNICODE mode is in force. Characters that are not within a range can be matched by complementing the set. If the first character of the set is '^', all the characters that are not in the set will be matched. For example, [^5] will match any character except '5', and [^^] will match any character except '^'. ^ has no special meaning if it’s not the first character in the set. To match a literal ']' inside a set, precede it with a backslash, or place it at the beginning of the set. For example, both [()[\]{}] and []()[{}] will both match a parenthesis. '|' A|B, where A and B can be arbitrary REs, creates a regular expression that will match either A or B. An arbitrary number of REs can be separated by the '|' in this way. This can be used inside groups (see below) as well. As the target string is scanned, REs separated by '|' are tried from left to right. When one pattern completely matches, that branch is accepted. This means that once A matches, B will not be tested further, even if it would produce a longer overall match. In other words, the '|' operator is never greedy. To match a literal '|', use \|, or enclose it inside a character class, as in [|]. (...) Matches whatever regular expression is inside the parentheses, and indicates the start and end of a group; the contents of a group can be retrieved after a match has been performed, and can be matched later in the string with the \number special sequence, described below. To match the literals '(' or ')', use \( or \), or enclose them inside a character class: [(] [)]. (?...) This is an extension notation (a '?' following a '(' is not meaningful otherwise). The first character after the '?' determines what the meaning and further syntax of the construct is. Extensions usually do not create a new group; (?P&lt;name&gt;...) is the only exception to this rule. Following are the currently supported extensions. (?iLmsux) (One or more letters from the set 'i', 'L', 'm', 's', 'u', 'x'.) The group matches the empty string; the letters set the corresponding flags: re.I (ignore case), re.L (locale dependent), re.M (multi-line), re.S (dot matches all), re.U (Unicode dependent), and re.X (verbose), for the entire regular expression. (The flags are described in Module Contents.) This is useful if you wish to include the flags as part of the regular expression, instead of passing a flag argument to the re.compile() function. Note that the (?x) flag changes how the expression is parsed. It should be used first in the expression string, or after one or more whitespace characters. If there are non-whitespace characters before the flag, the results are undefined. (?:...) A non-capturing version of regular parentheses. Matches whatever regular expression is inside the parentheses, but the substring matched by the group cannot be retrieved after performing a match or referenced later in the pattern. (?P&lt;name&gt;...) Similar to regular parentheses, but the substring matched by the group is accessible via the symbolic group name name. Group names must be valid Python identifiers, and each group name must be defined only once within a regular expression. A symbolic group is also a numbered group, just as if the group were not named. Named groups can be referenced in three contexts. If the pattern is (?P&lt;quote&gt;['&quot;]).*?(?P=quote) (i.e. matching a string quoted with either single or double quotes): Context of reference to group “quote” Ways to reference it in the same pattern itself (?P=quote) (as shown) \1 when processing match object m m.group('quote') m.end('quote') (etc.) in a string passed to the repl argument of re.sub() \g&lt;quote&gt; \g&lt;1&gt; \1 (?P=name) A backreference to a named group; it matches whatever text was matched by the earlier group named name. (?#...) A comment; the contents of the parentheses are simply ignored. (?=...) Matches if ... matches next, but doesn’t consume any of the string. This is called a lookahead assertion. For example, Isaac (?=Asimov) will match 'Isaac ' only if it’s followed by 'Asimov'. (?!...) Matches if ... doesn’t match next. This is a negative lookahead assertion. For example, Isaac (?!Asimov) will match 'Isaac ' only if it’s not followed by 'Asimov'. (?&lt;=...) Matches if the current position in the string is preceded by a match for ... that ends at the current position. This is called a positive lookbehind assertion. (?&lt;=abc)def will find a match in abcdef, since the lookbehind will back up 3 characters and check if the contained pattern matches. The contained pattern must only match strings of some fixed length, meaning that abc or a|b are allowed, but a* and a{3,4} are not. Group references are not supported even if they match strings of some fixed length. Note that patterns which start with positive lookbehind assertions will not match at the beginning of the string being searched; you will most likely want to use the search() function rather than the match() function: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; import re &gt;&gt;&gt; m = re.search('(?&lt;=abc)def', 'abcdef') &gt;&gt;&gt; m.group(0) 'def' This example looks for a word following a hyphen: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; m = re.search('(?&lt;=-)\w+', 'spam-egg') &gt;&gt;&gt; m.group(0) 'egg' (?&lt;!...) Matches if the current position in the string is not preceded by a match for .... This is called a negative lookbehind assertion. Similar to positive lookbehind assertions, the contained pattern must only match strings of some fixed length and shouldn’t contain group references. Patterns which start with negative lookbehind assertions may match at the beginning of the string being searched. (?(id/name)yes-pattern|no-pattern) Will try to match with yes-pattern if the group with given id or name exists, and with no-pattern if it doesn’t. no-pattern is optional and can be omitted. For example, (&lt;)?(\w+@\w+(?:\.\w+)+)(?(1)&gt;) is a poor email matching pattern, which will match with '&lt;user@host.com&gt;' as well as 'user@host.com', but not with '&lt;user@host.com'. New in version 2.4. The special sequences consist of '\' and a character from the list below. If the ordinary character is not on the list, then the resulting RE will match the second character. For example, \$ matches the character '$'. \number Matches the contents of the group of the same number. Groups are numbered starting from 1. For example, (.+) \1 matches 'the the' or '55 55', but not 'thethe' (note the space after the group). This special sequence can only be used to match one of the first 99 groups. If the first digit of number is 0, or number is 3 octal digits long, it will not be interpreted as a group match, but as the character with octal value number. Inside the '[' and ']' of a character class, all numeric escapes are treated as characters. \A Matches only at the start of the string. \b Matches the empty string, but only at the beginning or end of a word. A word is defined as a sequence of alphanumeric or underscore characters, so the end of a word is indicated by whitespace or a non-alphanumeric, non-underscore character. Note that formally, \b is defined as the boundary between a \w and a \W character (or vice versa), or between \w and the beginning/end of the string, so the precise set of characters deemed to be alphanumeric depends on the values of the UNICODE and LOCALE flags. For example, r'\bfoo\b' matches 'foo', 'foo.', '(foo)', 'bar foo baz' but not 'foobar' or 'foo3'. Inside a character range, \b represents the backspace character, for compatibility with Python’s string literals. \B Matches the empty string, but only when it is not at the beginning or end of a word. This means that r'py\B' matches 'python', 'py3', 'py2', but not 'py', 'py.', or 'py!'. \B is just the opposite of \b, so is also subject to the settings of LOCALE and UNICODE. \d When the UNICODE flag is not specified, matches any decimal digit; this is equivalent to the set [0-9]. With UNICODE, it will match whatever is classified as a decimal digit in the Unicode character properties database. \D When the UNICODE flag is not specified, matches any non-digit character; this is equivalent to the set [^0-9]. With UNICODE, it will match anything other than character marked as digits in the Unicode character properties database. \s When the UNICODE flag is not specified, it matches any whitespace character, this is equivalent to the set [ \t\n\r\f\v]. The LOCALE flag has no extra effect on matching of the space. If UNICODE is set, this will match the characters [ \t\n\r\f\v] plus whatever is classified as space in the Unicode character properties database. \S When the UNICODE flag is not specified, matches any non-whitespace character; this is equivalent to the set [^ \t\n\r\f\v] The LOCALE flag has no extra effect on non-whitespace match. If UNICODE is set, then any character not marked as space in the Unicode character properties database is matched. \w When the LOCALE and UNICODE flags are not specified, matches any alphanumeric character and the underscore; this is equivalent to the set [a-zA-Z0-9_]. With LOCALE, it will match the set [0-9_] plus whatever characters are defined as alphanumeric for the current locale. If UNICODE is set, this will match the characters [0-9_] plus whatever is classified as alphanumeric in the Unicode character properties database. \W When the LOCALE and UNICODE flags are not specified, matches any non-alphanumeric character; this is equivalent to the set [^a-zA-Z0-9_]. With LOCALE, it will match any character not in the set [0-9_], and not defined as alphanumeric for the current locale. If UNICODE is set, this will match anything other than [0-9_] plus characters classified as not alphanumeric in the Unicode character properties database. \Z Matches only at the end of the string. If both LOCALE and UNICODE flags are included for a particular sequence, then LOCALE flag takes effect first followed by the UNICODE. Most of the standard escapes supported by Python string literals are also accepted by the regular expression parser: \a \b \f \n \r \t \v \x \\ (Note that \b is used to represent word boundaries, and means “backspace” only inside character classes.) Octal escapes are included in a limited form: If the first digit is a 0, or if there are three octal digits, it is considered an octal escape. Otherwise, it is a group reference. As for string literals, octal escapes are always at most three digits in length. See also Mastering Regular Expressions Book on regular expressions by Jeffrey Friedl, published by O’Reilly. The second edition of the book no longer covers Python at all, but the first edition covered writing good regular expression patterns in great detail. 7.2.2. Module Contents¶ The module defines several functions, constants, and an exception. Some of the functions are simplified versions of the full featured methods for compiled regular expressions. Most non-trivial applications always use the compiled form. re.compile(pattern, flags=0)¶ Compile a regular expression pattern into a regular expression object, which can be used for matching using its match() and search() methods, described below. The expression’s behaviour can be modified by specifying a flags value. Values can be any of the following variables, combined using bitwise OR (the | operator). The sequence prog = re.compile(pattern) result = prog.match(string) is equivalent to result = re.match(pattern, string) but using re.compile() and saving the resulting regular expression object for reuse is more efficient when the expression will be used several times in a single program. Note The compiled versions of the most recent patterns passed to re.match(), re.search() or re.compile() are cached, so programs that use only a few regular expressions at a time needn’t worry about compiling regular expressions. re.DEBUG¶ Display debug information about compiled expression. re.I¶ re.IGNORECASE¶ Perform case-insensitive matching; expressions like [A-Z] will match lowercase letters, too. This is not affected by the current locale. re.L¶ re.LOCALE¶ Make \w, \W, \b, \B, \s and \S dependent on the current locale. re.M¶ re.MULTILINE¶ When specified, the pattern character '^' matches at the beginning of the string and at the beginning of each line (immediately following each newline); and the pattern character '$' matches at the end of the string and at the end of each line (immediately preceding each newline). By default, '^' matches only at the beginning of the string, and '$' only at the end of the string and immediately before the newline (if any) at the end of the string. re.S¶ re.DOTALL¶ Make the '.' special character match any character at all, including a newline; without this flag, '.' will match anything except a newline. re.U¶ re.UNICODE¶ Make \w, \W, \b, \B, \d, \D, \s and \S dependent on the Unicode character properties database. New in version 2.0. re.X¶ re.VERBOSE¶ This flag allows you to write regular expressions that look nicer and are more readable by allowing you to visually separate logical sections of the pattern and add comments. Whitespace within the pattern is ignored, except when in a character class or when preceded by an unescaped backslash. When a line contains a # that is not in a character class and is not preceded by an unescaped backslash, all characters from the leftmost such # through the end of the line are ignored. This means that the two following regular expression objects that match a decimal number are functionally equal: a = re.compile(r&quot;&quot;&quot;\d + # the integral part \. # the decimal point \d * # some fractional digits&quot;&quot;&quot;, re.X) b = re.compile(r&quot;\d+\.\d*&quot;) re.search(pattern, string, flags=0)¶ Scan through string looking for the first location where the regular expression pattern produces a match, and return a corresponding MatchObject instance. Return None if no position in the string matches the pattern; note that this is different from finding a zero-length match at some point in the string. re.match(pattern, string, flags=0)¶ If zero or more characters at the beginning of string match the regular expression pattern, return a corresponding MatchObject instance. Return None if the string does not match the pattern; note that this is different from a zero-length match. Note that even in MULTILINE mode, re.match() will only match at the beginning of the string and not at the beginning of each line. If you want to locate a match anywhere in string, use search() instead (see also search() vs. match()). re.split(pattern, string, maxsplit=0, flags=0)¶ Split string by the occurrences of pattern. If capturing parentheses are used in pattern, then the text of all groups in the pattern are also returned as part of the resulting list. If maxsplit is nonzero, at most maxsplit splits occur, and the remainder of the string is returned as the final element of the list. (Incompatibility note: in the original Python 1.5 release, maxsplit was ignored. This has been fixed in later releases.) &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; re.split('\W+', 'Words, words, words.') ['Words', 'words', 'words', ''] &gt;&gt;&gt; re.split('(\W+)', 'Words, words, words.') ['Words', ', ', 'words', ', ', 'words', '.', ''] &gt;&gt;&gt; re.split('\W+', 'Words, words, words.', 1) ['Words', 'words, words.'] &gt;&gt;&gt; re.split('[a-f]+', '0a3B9', flags=re.IGNORECASE) ['0', '3', '9'] If there are capturing groups in the separator and it matches at the start of the string, the result will start with an empty string. The same holds for the end of the string: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; re.split('(\W+)', '...words, words...') ['', '...', 'words', ', ', 'words', '...', ''] That way, separator components are always found at the same relative indices within the result list (e.g., if there’s one capturing group in the separator, the 0th, the 2nd and so forth). Note that split will never split a string on an empty pattern match. For example: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; re.split('x*', 'foo') ['foo'] &gt;&gt;&gt; re.split(&quot;(?m)^$&quot;, &quot;foo\n\nbar\n&quot;) ['foo\n\nbar\n'] Changed in version 2.7: Added the optional flags argument. re.findall(pattern, string, flags=0)¶ Return all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string, as a list of strings. The string is scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned in the order found. If one or more groups are present in the pattern, return a list of groups; this will be a list of tuples if the pattern has more than one group. Empty matches are included in the result unless they touch the beginning of another match. New in version 1.5.2. Changed in version 2.4: Added the optional flags argument. re.finditer(pattern, string, flags=0)¶ Return an iterator yielding MatchObject instances over all non-overlapping matches for the RE pattern in string. The string is scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned in the order found. Empty matches are included in the result unless they touch the beginning of another match. New in version 2.2. Changed in version 2.4: Added the optional flags argument. re.sub(pattern, repl, string, count=0, flags=0)¶ Return the string obtained by replacing the leftmost non-overlapping occurrences of pattern in string by the replacement repl. If the pattern isn’t found, string is returned unchanged. repl can be a string or a function; if it is a string, any backslash escapes in it are processed. That is, \n is converted to a single newline character, \r is converted to a carriage return, and so forth. Unknown escapes such as \j are left alone. Backreferences, such as \6, are replaced with the substring matched by group 6 in the pattern. For example: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; re.sub(r'def\s+([a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]*)\s*\(\s*\):', ... r'static PyObject*\npy_\1(void)\n{', ... 'def myfunc():') 'static PyObject*\npy_myfunc(void)\n{' If repl is a function, it is called for every non-overlapping occurrence of pattern. The function takes a single match object argument, and returns the replacement string. For example: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; def dashrepl(matchobj): ... if matchobj.group(0) == '-': return ' ' ... else: return '-' &gt;&gt;&gt; re.sub('-{1,2}', dashrepl, 'pro----gram-files') 'pro--gram files' &gt;&gt;&gt; re.sub(r'\sAND\s', ' &amp; ', 'Baked Beans And Spam', flags=re.IGNORECASE) 'Baked Beans &amp; Spam' The pattern may be a string or an RE object. The optional argument count is the maximum number of pattern occurrences to be replaced; count must be a non-negative integer. If omitted or zero, all occurrences will be replaced. Empty matches for the pattern are replaced only when not adjacent to a previous match, so sub('x*', '-', 'abc') returns '-a-b-c-'. In string-type repl arguments, in addition to the character escapes and backreferences described above, \g&lt;name&gt; will use the substring matched by the group named name, as defined by the (?P&lt;name&gt;...) syntax. \g&lt;number&gt; uses the corresponding group number; \g&lt;2&gt; is therefore equivalent to \2, but isn’t ambiguous in a replacement such as \g&lt;2&gt;0. \20 would be interpreted as a reference to group 20, not a reference to group 2 followed by the literal character '0'. The backreference \g&lt;0&gt; substitutes in the entire substring matched by the RE. Changed in version 2.7: Added the optional flags argument. re.subn(pattern, repl, string, count=0, flags=0)¶ Perform the same operation as sub(), but return a tuple (new_string, number_of_subs_made). Changed in version 2.7: Added the optional flags argument. re.escape(string)¶ Return string with all non-alphanumerics backslashed; this is useful if you want to match an arbitrary literal string that may have regular expression metacharacters in it. re.purge()¶ Clear the regular expression cache. exception re.error¶ Exception raised when a string passed to one of the functions here is not a valid regular expression (for example, it might contain unmatched parentheses) or when some other error occurs during compilation or matching. It is never an error if a string contains no match for a pattern. 7.2.3. Regular Expression Objects¶ class re.RegexObject¶ The RegexObject class supports the following methods and attributes: search(string[, pos[, endpos]])¶ Scan through string looking for a location where this regular expression produces a match, and return a corresponding MatchObject instance. Return None if no position in the string matches the pattern; note that this is different from finding a zero-length match at some point in the string. The optional second parameter pos gives an index in the string where the search is to start; it defaults to 0. This is not completely equivalent to slicing the string; the '^' pattern character matches at the real beginning of the string and at positions just after a newline, but not necessarily at the index where the search is to start. The optional parameter endpos limits how far the string will be searched; it will be as if the string is endpos characters long, so only the characters from pos to endpos - 1 will be searched for a match. If endpos is less than pos, no match will be found, otherwise, if rx is a compiled regular expression object, rx.search(string, 0, 50) is equivalent to rx.search(string[:50], 0). &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; pattern = re.compile(&quot;d&quot;) &gt;&gt;&gt; pattern.search(&quot;dog&quot;) # Match at index 0 &lt;_sre.SRE_Match object at ...&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; pattern.search(&quot;dog&quot;, 1) # No match; search doesn't include the &quot;d&quot; match(string[, pos[, endpos]])¶ If zero or more characters at the beginning of string match this regular expression, return a corresponding MatchObject instance. Return None if the string does not match the pattern; note that this is different from a zero-length match. The optional pos and endpos parameters have the same meaning as for the search() method. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; pattern = re.compile(&quot;o&quot;) &gt;&gt;&gt; pattern.match(&quot;dog&quot;) # No match as &quot;o&quot; is not at the start of &quot;dog&quot;. &gt;&gt;&gt; pattern.match(&quot;dog&quot;, 1) # Match as &quot;o&quot; is the 2nd character of &quot;dog&quot;. &lt;_sre.SRE_Match object at ...&gt; If you want to locate a match anywhere in string, use search() instead (see also search() vs. match()). split(string, maxsplit=0)¶ Identical to the split() function, using the compiled pattern. findall(string[, pos[, endpos]])¶ Similar to the findall() function, using the compiled pattern, but also accepts optional pos and endpos parameters that limit the search region like for match(). finditer(string[, pos[, endpos]])¶ Similar to the finditer() function, using the compiled pattern, but also accepts optional pos and endpos parameters that limit the search region like for match(). sub(repl, string, count=0)¶ Identical to the sub() function, using the compiled pattern. subn(repl, string, count=0)¶ Identical to the subn() function, using the compiled pattern. flags¶ The regex matching flags. This is a combination of the flags given to compile() and any (?...) inline flags in the pattern. groups¶ The number of capturing groups in the pattern. groupindex¶ A dictionary mapping any symbolic group names defined by (?P&lt;id&gt;) to group numbers. The dictionary is empty if no symbolic groups were used in the pattern. pattern¶ The pattern string from which the RE object was compiled. 7.2.4. Match Objects¶ class re.MatchObject¶ Match objects always have a boolean value of True. Since match() and search() return None when there is no match, you can test whether there was a match with a simple if statement: match = re.search(pattern, string) if match: process(match) Match objects support the following methods and attributes: expand(template)¶ Return the string obtained by doing backslash substitution on the template string template, as done by the sub() method. Escapes such as \n are converted to the appropriate characters, and numeric backreferences (\1, \2) and named backreferences (\g&lt;1&gt;, \g&lt;name&gt;) are replaced by the contents of the corresponding group. group([group1, ...])¶ Returns one or more subgroups of the match. If there is a single argument, the result is a single string; if there are multiple arguments, the result is a tuple with one item per argument. Without arguments, group1 defaults to zero (the whole match is returned). If a groupN argument is zero, the corresponding return value is the entire matching string; if it is in the inclusive range [1..99], it is the string matching the corresponding parenthesized group. If a group number is negative or larger than the number of groups defined in the pattern, an IndexError exception is raised. If a group is contained in a part of the pattern that did not match, the corresponding result is None. If a group is contained in a part of the pattern that matched multiple times, the last match is returned. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; m = re.match(r&quot;(\w+) (\w+)&quot;, &quot;Isaac Newton, physicist&quot;) &gt;&gt;&gt; m.group(0) # The entire match 'Isaac Newton' &gt;&gt;&gt; m.group(1) # The first parenthesized subgroup. 'Isaac' &gt;&gt;&gt; m.group(2) # The second parenthesized subgroup. 'Newton' &gt;&gt;&gt; m.group(1, 2) # Multiple arguments give us a tuple. ('Isaac', 'Newton') If the regular expression uses the (?P&lt;name&gt;...) syntax, the groupN arguments may also be strings identifying groups by their group name. If a string argument is not used as a group name in the pattern, an IndexError exception is raised. A moderately complicated example: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; m = re.match(r&quot;(?P&lt;first_name&gt;\w+) (?P&lt;last_name&gt;\w+)&quot;, &quot;Malcolm Reynolds&quot;) &gt;&gt;&gt; m.group('first_name') 'Malcolm' &gt;&gt;&gt; m.group('last_name') 'Reynolds' Named groups can also be referred to by their index: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; m.group(1) 'Malcolm' &gt;&gt;&gt; m.group(2) 'Reynolds' If a group matches multiple times, only the last match is accessible: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; m = re.match(r&quot;(..)+&quot;, &quot;a1b2c3&quot;) # Matches 3 times. &gt;&gt;&gt; m.group(1) # Returns only the last match. 'c3' groups([default])¶ Return a tuple containing all the subgroups of the match, from 1 up to however many groups are in the pattern. The default argument is used for groups that did not participate in the match; it defaults to None. (Incompatibility note: in the original Python 1.5 release, if the tuple was one element long, a string would be returned instead. In later versions (from 1.5.1 on), a singleton tuple is returned in such cases.) For example: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; m = re.match(r&quot;(\d+)\.(\d+)&quot;, &quot;24.1632&quot;) &gt;&gt;&gt; m.groups() ('24', '1632') If we make the decimal place and everything after it optional, not all groups might participate in the match. These groups will default to None unless the default argument is given: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; m = re.match(r&quot;(\d+)\.?(\d+)?&quot;, &quot;24&quot;) &gt;&gt;&gt; m.groups() # Second group defaults to None. ('24', None) &gt;&gt;&gt; m.groups('0') # Now, the second group defaults to '0'. ('24', '0') groupdict([default])¶ Return a dictionary containing all the named subgroups of the match, keyed by the subgroup name. The default argument is used for groups that did not participate in the match; it defaults to None. For example: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; m = re.match(r&quot;(?P&lt;first_name&gt;\w+) (?P&lt;last_name&gt;\w+)&quot;, &quot;Malcolm Reynolds&quot;) &gt;&gt;&gt; m.groupdict() {'first_name': 'Malcolm', 'last_name': 'Reynolds'} start([group])¶ end([group])¶ Return the indices of the start and end of the substring matched by group; group defaults to zero (meaning the whole matched substring). Return -1 if group exists but did not contribute to the match. For a match object m, and a group g that did contribute to the match, the substring matched by group g (equivalent to m.group(g)) is m.string[m.start(g):m.end(g)] Note that m.start(group) will equal m.end(group) if group matched a null string. For example, after m = re.search('b(c?)', 'cba'), m.start(0) is 1, m.end(0) is 2, m.start(1) and m.end(1) are both 2, and m.start(2) raises an IndexError exception. An example that will remove remove_this from email addresses: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; email = &quot;tony@tiremove_thisger.net&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt; m = re.search(&quot;remove_this&quot;, email) &gt;&gt;&gt; email[:m.start()] + email[m.end():] 'tony@tiger.net' span([group])¶ For MatchObject m, return the 2-tuple (m.start(group), m.end(group)). Note that if group did not contribute to the match, this is (-1, -1). group defaults to zero, the entire match. pos¶ The value of pos which was passed to the search() or match() method of the RegexObject. This is the index into the string at which the RE engine started looking for a match. endpos¶ The value of endpos which was passed to the search() or match() method of the RegexObject. This is the index into the string beyond which the RE engine will not go. lastindex¶ The integer index of the last matched capturing group, or None if no group was matched at all. For example, the expressions (a)b, ((a)(b)), and ((ab)) will have lastindex == 1 if applied to the string 'ab', while the expression (a)(b) will have lastindex == 2, if applied to the same string. lastgroup¶ The name of the last matched capturing group, or None if the group didn’t have a name, or if no group was matched at all. re¶ The regular expression object whose match() or search() method produced this MatchObject instance. string¶ The string passed to match() or search(). 7.2.5. Examples¶ 7.2.5.1. Checking For a Pair¶ In this example, we’ll use the following helper function to display match objects a little more gracefully: def displaymatch(match): if match is None: return None return '&lt;Match: %r, groups=%r&gt;' % (match.group(), match.groups()) Suppose you are writing a poker program where a player’s hand is represented as a 5-character string with each character representing a card, “a” for ace, “k” for king, “q” for queen, “j” for jack, “t” for 10, and “2” through “9” representing the card with that value. To see if a given string is a valid hand, one could do the following: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; valid = re.compile(r&quot;^[a2-9tjqk]{5}$&quot;) &gt;&gt;&gt; displaymatch(valid.match(&quot;akt5q&quot;)) # Valid. &quot;&lt;Match: 'akt5q', groups=()&gt;&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt; displaymatch(valid.match(&quot;akt5e&quot;)) # Invalid. &gt;&gt;&gt; displaymatch(valid.match(&quot;akt&quot;)) # Invalid. &gt;&gt;&gt; displaymatch(valid.match(&quot;727ak&quot;)) # Valid. &quot;&lt;Match: '727ak', groups=()&gt;&quot; That last hand, &quot;727ak&quot;, contained a pair, or two of the same valued cards. To match this with a regular expression, one could use backreferences as such: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; pair = re.compile(r&quot;.*(.).*\1&quot;) &gt;&gt;&gt; displaymatch(pair.match(&quot;717ak&quot;)) # Pair of 7s. &quot;&lt;Match: '717', groups=('7',)&gt;&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt; displaymatch(pair.match(&quot;718ak&quot;)) # No pairs. &gt;&gt;&gt; displaymatch(pair.match(&quot;354aa&quot;)) # Pair of aces. &quot;&lt;Match: '354aa', groups=('a',)&gt;&quot; To find out what card the pair consists of, one could use the group() method of MatchObject in the following manner: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; pair.match(&quot;717ak&quot;).group(1) '7' # Error because re.match() returns None, which doesn't have a group() method: &gt;&gt;&gt; pair.match(&quot;718ak&quot;).group(1) Traceback (most recent call last): File &quot;&lt;pyshell#23&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt; re.match(r&quot;.*(.).*\1&quot;, &quot;718ak&quot;).group(1) AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group' &gt;&gt;&gt; pair.match(&quot;354aa&quot;).group(1) 'a' 7.2.5.2. Simulating scanf()¶ Python does not currently have an equivalent to scanf(). Regular expressions are generally more powerful, though also more verbose, than scanf() format strings. The table below offers some more-or-less equivalent mappings between scanf() format tokens and regular expressions. scanf() Token Regular Expression %c . %5c .{5} %d [-+]?\d+ %e, %E, %f, %g [-+]?(\d+(\.\d*)?|\.\d+)([eE][-+]?\d+)? %i [-+]?(0[xX][\dA-Fa-f]+|0[0-7]*|\d+) %o [-+]?[0-7]+ %s \S+ %u \d+ %x, %X [-+]?(0[xX])?[\dA-Fa-f]+ To extract the filename and numbers from a string like /usr/sbin/sendmail - 0 errors, 4 warnings you would use a scanf() format like %s - %d errors, %d warnings The equivalent regular expression would be (\S+) - (\d+) errors, (\d+) warnings 7.2.5.3. search() vs. match()¶ Python offers two different primitive operations based on regular expressions: re.match() checks for a match only at the beginning of the string, while re.search() checks for a match anywhere in the string (this is what Perl does by default). For example: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; re.match(&quot;c&quot;, &quot;abcdef&quot;) # No match &gt;&gt;&gt; re.search(&quot;c&quot;, &quot;abcdef&quot;) # Match &lt;_sre.SRE_Match object at ...&gt; Regular expressions beginning with '^' can be used with search() to restrict the match at the beginning of the string: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; re.match(&quot;c&quot;, &quot;abcdef&quot;) # No match &gt;&gt;&gt; re.search(&quot;^c&quot;, &quot;abcdef&quot;) # No match &gt;&gt;&gt; re.search(&quot;^a&quot;, &quot;abcdef&quot;) # Match &lt;_sre.SRE_Match object at ...&gt; Note however that in MULTILINE mode match() only matches at the beginning of the string, whereas using search() with a regular expression beginning with '^' will match at the beginning of each line. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; re.match('X', 'A\nB\nX', re.MULTILINE) # No match &gt;&gt;&gt; re.search('^X', 'A\nB\nX', re.MULTILINE) # Match &lt;_sre.SRE_Match object at ...&gt; 7.2.5.4. Making a Phonebook¶ split() splits a string into a list delimited by the passed pattern. The method is invaluable for converting textual data into data structures that can be easily read and modified by Python as demonstrated in the following example that creates a phonebook. First, here is the input. Normally it may come from a file, here we are using triple-quoted string syntax: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; text = &quot;&quot;&quot;Ross McFluff: 834.345.1254 155 Elm Street ... ... Ronald Heathmore: 892.345.3428 436 Finley Avenue ... Frank Burger: 925.541.7625 662 South Dogwood Way ... ... ... Heather Albrecht: 548.326.4584 919 Park Place&quot;&quot;&quot; The entries are separated by one or more newlines. Now we convert the string into a list with each nonempty line having its own entry: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; entries = re.split(&quot;\n+&quot;, text) &gt;&gt;&gt; entries ['Ross McFluff: 834.345.1254 155 Elm Street', 'Ronald Heathmore: 892.345.3428 436 Finley Avenue', 'Frank Burger: 925.541.7625 662 South Dogwood Way', 'Heather Albrecht: 548.326.4584 919 Park Place'] Finally, split each entry into a list with first name, last name, telephone number, and address. We use the maxsplit parameter of split() because the address has spaces, our splitting pattern, in it: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; [re.split(&quot;:? &quot;, entry, 3) for entry in entries] [['Ross', 'McFluff', '834.345.1254', '155 Elm Street'], ['Ronald', 'Heathmore', '892.345.3428', '436 Finley Avenue'], ['Frank', 'Burger', '925.541.7625', '662 South Dogwood Way'], ['Heather', 'Albrecht', '548.326.4584', '919 Park Place']] The :? pattern matches the colon after the last name, so that it does not occur in the result list. With a maxsplit of 4, we could separate the house number from the street name: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; [re.split(&quot;:? &quot;, entry, 4) for entry in entries] [['Ross', 'McFluff', '834.345.1254', '155', 'Elm Street'], ['Ronald', 'Heathmore', '892.345.3428', '436', 'Finley Avenue'], ['Frank', 'Burger', '925.541.7625', '662', 'South Dogwood Way'], ['Heather', 'Albrecht', '548.326.4584', '919', 'Park Place']] 7.2.5.5. Text Munging¶ sub() replaces every occurrence of a pattern with a string or the result of a function. This example demonstrates using sub() with a function to “munge” text, or randomize the order of all the characters in each word of a sentence except for the first and last characters: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; def repl(m): ... inner_word = list(m.group(2)) ... random.shuffle(inner_word) ... return m.group(1) + &quot;&quot;.join(inner_word) + m.group(3) &gt;&gt;&gt; text = &quot;Professor Abdolmalek, please report your absences promptly.&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt; re.sub(r&quot;(\w)(\w+)(\w)&quot;, repl, text) 'Poefsrosr Aealmlobdk, pslaee reorpt your abnseces plmrptoy.' &gt;&gt;&gt; re.sub(r&quot;(\w)(\w+)(\w)&quot;, repl, text) 'Pofsroser Aodlambelk, plasee reoprt yuor asnebces potlmrpy.' 7.2.5.6. Finding all Adverbs¶ findall() matches all occurrences of a pattern, not just the first one as search() does. For example, if one was a writer and wanted to find all of the adverbs in some text, he or she might use findall() in the following manner: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; text = &quot;He was carefully disguised but captured quickly by police.&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt; re.findall(r&quot;\w+ly&quot;, text) ['carefully', 'quickly'] 7.2.5.7. Finding all Adverbs and their Positions¶ If one wants more information about all matches of a pattern than the matched text, finditer() is useful as it provides instances of MatchObject instead of strings. Continuing with the previous example, if one was a writer who wanted to find all of the adverbs and their positions in some text, he or she would use finditer() in the following manner: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; text = &quot;He was carefully disguised but captured quickly by police.&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt; for m in re.finditer(r&quot;\w+ly&quot;, text): ... print '%02d-%02d: %s' % (m.start(), m.end(), m.group(0)) 07-16: carefully 40-47: quickly 7.2.5.8. Raw String Notation¶ Raw string notation (r&quot;text&quot;) keeps regular expressions sane. Without it, every backslash ('\') in a regular expression would have to be prefixed with another one to escape it. For example, the two following lines of code are functionally identical: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; re.match(r&quot;\W(.)\1\W&quot;, &quot; ff &quot;) &lt;_sre.SRE_Match object at ...&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; re.match(&quot;\\W(.)\\1\\W&quot;, &quot; ff &quot;) &lt;_sre.SRE_Match object at ...&gt; When one wants to match a literal backslash, it must be escaped in the regular expression. With raw string notation, this means r&quot;\\&quot;. Without raw string notation, one must use &quot;\\\\&quot;, making the following lines of code functionally identical: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; re.match(r&quot;\\&quot;, r&quot;\\&quot;) &lt;_sre.SRE_Match object at ...&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; re.match(&quot;\\\\&quot;, r&quot;\\&quot;) &lt;_sre.SRE_Match object at ...&gt; Table Of Contents 7.2. re — Regular expression operations 7.2.1.

In this article, we are going to find out handy use of cat commands with their examples in Linux. Read Also: Learn How to use ‘cat’ and ‘tac’ (Reverse of cat Command) in Linux Linux Cat Command 13 Basic Linux Cat Commands General Syntax cat [OPTION] [FILE]... 1. Display Contains of File In the below example, it will show contains of /etc/passwd file. # cat /etc/passwd root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/sbin/nologin narad:x:500:500::/home/narad:/bin/bash 2. View Contains of Multiple Files in terminal In below example, it will display contains of test and test1 file in terminal. # cat test test1 Hello everybody Hi world, 3. Create a File with Cat Command We will create a file called test2 file with below command. # cat &gt;test2 Awaits input from user, type desired text and press CTRL+D (hold down Ctrl Key and type ‘d‘) to exit. The text will be written in test2 file. You can see contains of file with following cat command. # cat test2 hello everyone, how do you do? 4. Use Cat Command with More &amp; Less Options If file having large number of contains that won’t fit in output terminal and screen scrolls up very fast, we can use parameters more and less with cat command as show above. # cat song.txt | more # cat song.txt | less 5. Display Line Numbers in File With -n option you could see the line numbers of a file song.txt in the output terminal. # cat -n song.txt 1 &quot;Heal The World&quot; 2 There's A Place In 3 Your Heart 4 And I Know That It Is Love 5 And This Place Could 6 Be Much 7 Brighter Than Tomorrow 8 And If You Really Try 9 You'll Find There's No Need 10 To Cry 11 In This Place You'll Feel 12 There's No Hurt Or Sorrow 6. Display $ at the End of File In the below, you can see with -e option that ‘$‘ is shows at the end of line and also in space showing ‘$‘ if there is any gap between paragraphs. This options is useful to squeeze multiple lines in a single line. # cat -e test hello everyone, how do you do?$ $ Hey, am fine.$ How's your training going on?$ $ 7. Display Tab separated Lines in File In the below output, we could see TAB space is filled up with ‘^I‘ character. # cat -T test hello ^Ieveryone, how do you do? Hey, ^Iam fine. ^I^IHow's your training ^Igoing on? Let's do ^Isome practice in Linux. 8. Display Multiple Files at Once In the below example we have three files test, test1 and test2 and able to view the contains of those file as shown above. We need to separate each file with ; (semi colon). # cat test; cat test1; cat test2 This is test file This is test1 file. This is test2 file. 9. Use Standard Output with Redirection Operator We can redirect standard output of a file into a new file else existing file with ‘&gt;‘ (greater than) symbol. Careful, existing contains of test1 will be overwritten by contains of test file. # cat test &gt; test1 10. Appending Standard Output with Redirection Operator Appends in existing file with ‘&gt;&gt;‘ (double greater than) symbol. Here, contains of test file will be appended at the end of test1 file. # cat test &gt;&gt; test1 11. Redirecting Standard Input with Redirection Operator When you use the redirect with standard input ‘&lt;‘ (less than symbol), it use file name test2 as a input for a command and output will be shown in a terminal. # cat &lt; test2 This is test2 file. 12. Redirecting Multiple Files Contain in a Single File This will create a file called test3 and all output will be redirected in a newly created file. # cat test test1 test2 &gt; test3 13. Sorting Contains of Multiple Files in a Single File This will create a file test4 and output of cat command is piped to sort and result will be redirected in a newly created file. # cat test test1 test2 test3 | sort &gt; test4 This article shows the basic commands that may help you to explore cat command. You may refer man page of cat command if you want to know more options. In out next article we will cover more advanced cat commands.

Reply Ravi Saive says: December 16, 2015 at 1:07 pm @Satish, The cat command will list the all content of the file (entire file) on the screen itself you don’t need to scroll up or down. If the file is too long, it quickly moves past you on the screen. To prevent this, use the following command: # cat filename.txt | less If you want to edit the file, open the file with vi editor, press ‘i’ to insert mode for editing. # vi filename.txt If you still don’t understand, I suggest you to read our Vi/Vim tricks guides here. http://www.tecmint.com/vi-editor-usage/ http://www.tecmint.com/learn-vi-and-vim-editor-tips-and-tricks-in-linux/ http://www.tecmint.com/how-to-use-vi-and-vim-editor-in-linux/ displays the contents of an entire file on the screen Reply satish says: November 19, 2015 at 12:54 pm cat test* &gt;&gt;some.txt Reply Sieyongdong says: May 14, 2015 at 5:53 pm thank u so much for sharing this ! It’s very useful. Reply susheel says: October 25, 2013 at 7:49 am i think cat test and cat &lt; test both are same right? if any difference please tell me….. Reply Braden says: February 2, 2014 at 7:13 am They are two very different methods of achieving the same result. ‘cat file’ takes file as an argument, opening the file and displaying its contents ‘cat &lt; file' opens file, and redirects its contents to stdin, so the cat command will take the contents of the file as if they were being typed in by a keyboard. To better understand what's going on, try this: in terminal 1: $ mkfifo test $ cat test In terminal 2, start typing. Every time you hit enter, you will see the text you just typed appear in terminal 1. Hit Ctrl+D and it will kill both the running cats. Reply Braden says: February 2, 2014 at 7:16 am I don’t know why it deleted half my text, but let’s try this again. Terminal 1 should have a cat command, and terminal 2 should also have a cat command. If you don’t see two cat commands, then a bot is filtering my comment. Terminal 1: $ mkfifo test $ cat test Now you can start typing into terminal 2. Reply Braden says: February 2, 2014 at 7:20 am Ah, I figured out what’s going on: It thinks I’m trying to type HTML. One more time: T1: $ mkfifo test $ cat &lt; test T2: $cat &gt; test Reply Braden says: February 2, 2014 at 7:32 am Moderators: If you see this chain of self-replies, please fix it and edit the original reply to convey what I’m trying to convey. If you didn’t already figure out what’s going on, I used &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; to generate &lt; and &gt;, otherwise, “this &lt;te&gt;xt” becomes “this xt” because it is interpreted as a tag. Also, the ability to edit comments would be much welcomed. I hate to mess up a discussion thread with a million self-replies that try to figure out why X didn’t work. Thanks Gul zaman Jamali says: July 9, 2013 at 8:36 pm Excellent information for Linux users.. Reply arush says: July 9, 2013 at 4:16 pm Can you please elaborate point number 11 Reply Braden says: February 2, 2014 at 6:53 am #11 is total B.S. ‘cat &lt; file' does not take 'file' as an argument. What 'cat &lt; file' does, is use the contents (not &quot;contains&quot;) of file as the input for cat, taking the place of the keyboard. It is functionally equivalent to 'cat file', and is thus completely redundant. Reply deepak says: October 27, 2014 at 12:26 pm you are absolutely right. I wasted my time on that command. #11 is crap Reply Ariel Chiong says: January 22, 2013 at 3:08 am Q. Hi All, Can you show me what is the command or terminal to use with this question “Search lines which contains alpha-numeric words( combination of alphabets and number) and copy those lines is sorted order to /root/lines (output should not contain any blank lines)”. for example I have a file called Searchline.txt. thank you. Reply Chris F.A. Johnson says: November 1, 2012 at 12:55 am Why “cat test; cat test1; cat test2” ? Why not “cat test test1 test2” ? Why “cat song.txt | more” instead of “more song.txt”? Reply satish says: November 19, 2015 at 12:50 pm why can’t “cat test &gt;&gt;some.txt*” Reply satish says: November 19, 2015 at 12:51 pm Sorry it is cat test* &gt;&gt;some.txt Reply Got something to say?

                   NS1:content=" Navigation index next | previous | Embedded Software Update Documentation 2016.07 documentation » SWUpdate: software update for embedded system¶ Overview¶ This project is thought to help to update an embedded system from a storage media or from network. However, it should be mainly considered as a framework, where further protocols or installers (in SWUpdate they are called handlers) can be easily added to the application. One use case is to update from an external local media, as USB-Pen or SD-Card. In this case, the update is done without any intervention by an operator: it is thought as “one-key-update”, and the software is started at reset simply pressing a key (or in any way that can be recognized by the target), making all checks automatically. At the end, the updating process reports only the status to the operator (successful or failed). The output can be displayed on a LCD using the frame-buffer device or directed to a serial line (Linux console). It is generally used in the single copy approach, running in a initrd (recipes are provided to generate with Yocto). However, it is possible to use it in a double-copy approach by use of Software collections. If started for a remote update, SWUpdate starts an embedded Web-server and waits for requests. The operator must upload a suitable image, that SWUpdate checks and then install. All output is notified to the operator’s browser via AJAX notifications. Single image delivery¶ The main concept is that the manufacturer delivers a single big image. All single images are packed together (cpio was chosen for its simplicity and because can be streamed) together with an additional file (sw-description), that contains meta information about each single image. The format of sw-description can be customized: SWUpdate can be configured to use its internal parser (based on libconfig), or calling an external parser in LUA. _images/image_format.png Changing the rules to accept images with an external parser, let to extend to new image types and how they are installed. In fact, the scope of the parser is to retrieve which single images must be installed and how. SWUpdate implements “handlers” to install a single image: there are handlers to install images into UBI volumes, or to a SD card, a CFI Flash, and so on. It is then easy to add an own handler if a very special installer is required. For example we can think at a project with a main processor and one or several micro-controllers. Let’s say for simplicity that the main processor communicates with the micro-controllers via UARTS using a proprietary protocol. The software on the micro-controllers can be updated using the proprietary protocol. It is possible to extend SWUpdate writing a handler, that implements the part of the proprietary protocol to perform the upgrade on the micro-controller. The parser must recognize which image must be installed with the new handler, and SWUpdate will call the handler during the installation process. Handling configuration differences¶ The concept can be extended to deliver a single image containing the release for multiple devices. Each device has its own kernel, dtb and root filesystem, or they can share some parts. Currently this is managed (and already used in a real project) by writing an own parser, that checks which images must be installed after recognizing which is the device where software is running. Because the external parser can be written in LUA and it is completely customizable, everybody can set his own rules. For this specific example, the sw-description is written in XML format, with tags identifying the images for each device. To run it, the liblxp library is needed. &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt; &lt;software version=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt; &lt;name&gt;Update Image&lt;/name&gt; &lt;version&gt;1.0.0&lt;/version&gt; &lt;description&gt;Firmware for XXXXX Project&lt;/description&gt; &lt;images&gt; &lt;image device=&quot;firstdevice&quot; version=&quot;0.9&quot;&gt; &lt;stream name=&quot;dev1-uImage&quot; type=&quot;ubivol&quot; volume=&quot;kernel&quot; /&gt; &lt;stream name=&quot;dev1.dtb&quot; type=&quot;ubivol&quot; volume=&quot;dtb&quot; /&gt; &lt;stream name=&quot;dev1-rootfs.ubifs&quot; type=&quot;ubivol&quot; volume=&quot;rootfs&quot;/&gt; &lt;stream name=&quot;dev1-uboot-env&quot; type=&quot;uboot&quot; /&gt; &lt;stream name=&quot;raw_vfat&quot; type=&quot;raw&quot; dest=&quot;/dev/mmcblk0p4&quot; /&gt; &lt;stream name=&quot;sdcard.lua&quot; type=&quot;lua&quot; /&gt; &lt;/image&gt; &lt;image device=&quot;seconddevice&quot; version=&quot;0.9&quot;&gt; &lt;stream name=&quot;dev2-uImage&quot; type=&quot;ubivol&quot; volume=&quot;kernel&quot; /&gt; &lt;stream name=&quot;dev2.dtb&quot; rev=&quot;0.9&quot; type=&quot;ubivol&quot; volume=&quot;dtb&quot; /&gt; &lt;stream name=&quot;dev2-rootfs.ubifs&quot; type=&quot;ubivol&quot; volume=&quot;rootfs&quot;/&gt; &lt;/image&gt; &lt;/images&gt; &lt;/software&gt; The parser for this is in the /examples directory. By identifying which is the running device, the parser return a table containing the images that must be installed and their associated handlers. By reading the delivered image, SWUpdate will ignore all images that are not in the list processed by the parser. In this way, it is possible to have a single delivered image for the update of multiple devices. Multiple devices are supported by the default parser, too. software = { version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;; target-1 = { images: ( { ... } ); }; target-2 = { images: ( { ... } ); }; } In this way, it is possible to have a single image providing software for each device you have. By default the hardware information is extracted from /etc/hwrevision file. The file should contain a single line in the following format: &lt;boardname&gt; &lt;revision&gt; Where: &lt;revision&gt; will be used for matching with hardware compatibility list &lt;boardname&gt; can be used for grouping board specific settigns Software collections¶ Software collections and operation modes can be used to implement a dual copy strategy. The simplest case is to define two installation locations for the firmware image and call SWUpdate selecting the appropriate image. software = { version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;; stable = { copy-1: { images: ( { device = &quot;/dev/mtd4&quot; ... } ); } copy-2: { images: ( { device = &quot;/dev/mtd5&quot; ... } ); } }; } In this way it is possible to specify that copy-1 gets installed to /dev/mtd4, while copy-2 to /dev/mtd5. By properly selecting the installation locations, SWUpdate will update the firmware in the other slot. The method of image selection is out of the scope of SWUpdate and user is responsible for calling SWUpdate passing proper settings. Streaming feature¶ SWUpdate is thought to be able to stream the received image directly into the target, without any temporary copy. In fact, the single installer (handler) receive as input the file descriptor set at the beginning of the image that must be installed. The feature can be set on image basis, that means that a user can decide which partial images should be streamed. If not streamed (see installed-directly flag), files are temporary extracted into /tmp. Of course, by streaming it is not possible to make checks on the whole delivered software before installing. The temporary copy is done only when updated from network. When the image is stored on an external storage, there is no need of that copy. List of supported features¶ Install on embedded Media (eMMC, SD, Raw NAND, NOR and SPI-NOR flashes) check if a image is available. The image is built in a specified format (cpio) and it must contain a file describing the software that must be updated. SWUpdate is thought to update UBI volumes (mainly for NAND, but not only) and images on devices. Passing a whole image can still be updated as a partition on the SD card, or a MTD partition. new partition schema. This is bound with UBI volume. SWUpdate can recreate UBI volumes, resizing them and copying the new software. A special UBI volume with the name “data” is saved and restored after repartitioning with all data it contains, to maintain user’s data. support for compressed images, using the zlib library. tarball (tgz file) are supported. support for partitioned USB-pen or unpartitioned (mainly used by Windows). support for updating a single file inside a filesystem. The filesystem where to put the file must be described. checksum for the single components of an image use a structured language to describe the image. This is done using the libconfig library as default parser, that uses a JSON-like description. use custom’s choice for the description of the image. It is possible to write an own parser using the LUA language. An example using a XML description in LUA is provided in the examples directory. Support for setting / erasing U-Boot variables Support for preinstall scripts. They run before updating the images Support for postinstall scripts. They run after updating the images. Network installer using an embedded Web-server (Mongoose Server was chosen, in the version under LUA license). A different Web-server can be used. Multiple interfaces for getting software (local Storage, integrated Web-Server, remote Server) Can be configured to check for compatibility between software and hardware revisions. The software image must contain an entry declaring on which HW revision the software is allowed to run. SWUpdate refuses to install if the compatibility is not verified. support for image extraction. A manufacturer can require to have a single image that contains the software for more as one device. This simplifies the manufacturer’s management and reduces their administrative costs having a single software product. SWUpdate receives the software as stream without temporary storing, and extracts only the required components for the device to be installed. allow custom handlers for installing FPGA firmware, micro-controller firmware via custom protocols. Features are enabled / disabled using “make menuconfig”. (Kbuild is inherited from busybox project) Power-Off safe Images fully streamed¶ In case of remote update, SWUpdate extracts relevant images from the stream and copy them into /tmp before calling the handlers. This guarantee that an update is initiated only if all parts are present and correct. However, on some systems with less resources, the amount of RAM to copy the images could be not enough, for example if the filesystem on an attached SD Card must be updated. In this case, it will help if the images are installed directly as stream by the corresponding handler, without temporary copies. Not all handlers support to stream directly into the target. Streaming with zero-copy is enabled by setting the flag “installed-directly” in the descriptionü of the single image. Configuration and build¶ Requirements¶ There are only a few libraries that are required to compile SWUpdate. mtd-utils: internally, mtd-utils generates libmtd and libubi. They are commonly not exported and not installed, but they are linked by SWUpdate to reuse the same functions for upgrading MTD and UBI volumes. openssl: required with the Webserver LUA: liblua and the development headers. libz, libcrypto are always linked. libconfig: it is used by the default parser. libarchive (optional) for archive handler libjson (optional) for JSON parser New handlers can add some other libraries to the requirement list - check if you need all handlers in case you get build errors, and drop what you do not need. Building with Yocto¶ A meta-SWUpdate layer is provided. It contains the required changes for mtd-utils and for generating LUA. Using meta-SWUpdate is a straightforward process. Firstly, clone meta-SWUpdate from: Add meta-SWUpdate as usual to your bblayers.conf. In meta-SWUpdate there is a recipe to generate a initrd with a rescue system with SWUpdate. Use: MACHINE=&lt;your machine&gt; bitbake swupdate-image You will find the result in your tmp/deploy/&lt;your machine&gt; directory. How to install and start a initrd is very target specific - please check in the documentation of your bootloader. Configuring SWUpdate¶ SWUpdate is configurable via “make menuconfig”. The small footprint is reached using the internal parser and disabling the web-server. Any option has a small help describing its usage. In the default configuration, many options are already activated. To configure the options: make menuconfig Building¶ to cross-compile, set the CC and CXX variables before running make. It is also possible to set the cross-compiler prefix as option with make menuconfig. generate the code make The result is the binary “SWUpdate”. Running SWUpdate¶ What is expected from a SWUpdate run¶ A run of SWUpdate consists mainly of the following steps: check for media (USB-pen) check for an image file. The extension must be .swu extracts sw-description from the image and verifies it It parses sw-description creating a raw description in RAM about the activities that must be performed. Reads the cpio archive and proofs the checksum of each single file SWUpdate stops if the archive is not complete verified check for hardware-software compatibility, if any, reading hardware revision from hardware and matching with the table in sw-description. check that all components described in sw-description are really in the cpio archive. modify partitions, if required. This consists in a resize of UBI volumes, not a resize of MTD partition. A volume with the name “data” is saved and restored after resizing. runs pre-install scripts iterates through all images and call the corresponding handler for installing on target. runs post-install scripts update u-boot environment, if changes are specified in sw-description. reports the status to the operator (stdout) The first step that fails, stops the entire procedure and an error is reported. To start SWUpdate expecting the image from a file: swupdate -i &lt;filename&gt; To start with the embedded web-server: swupdate -w &quot;&lt;web-server options&gt;&quot; The main important parameter for the web-server is “document_root”. SWUpdate -w &quot;-document_root ./www&quot; The embedded web-server is taken from the Mongoose project (last release with LUA license). Additional parameters can be found in mongoose documentation. This uses as website the pages delivered with the code. Of course, they can be customized and replaced. The website uses AJAX to communicate with SWUpdate, and to show the progress of the update to the operator. The default port of the Web-server is 8080. You can then connect to the target with: http://&lt;target_ip&gt;:8080 If it works, the start page should be displayed as in next figure. _images/website.png If a correct image is downloaded, SWUpdate starts to process the received image. All notifications are sent back to the browser. SWUpdate provides a mechanism to send to a receiver the progress of the installation. In fact, SWUpdate takes a list of objects that registers itself with the application and they will be informed any time the application calls the notify() function. This allows also for self-written handlers to inform the upper layers about error conditions or simply return the status. It is then simply to add own receivers to implement customized way to display the results: displaying on a LCD (if the target has one), or sending back to another device via network. An example of the notifications sent back to the browser is in the next figure: _images/webprogress.png Software collections can be specified by passing –select command line option. Assuming sw-description file contains a collection named stable, with alt installation location, SWUpdate can be called like this: swupdate --select stable,alt Command line parameters¶ Parameter Type Description -b &lt;string&gt; string Active only if CONFIG_MTD is set It allows to blacklist MTDs when SWUpdate searches for UBI volumes. Example: U-Boot and environment in MTD0-1: swupdate -b “0 1” -d &lt;URL&gt; string Active only if CONFIG_DOWNLOAD is set This is the URL where new software is pulled. URL is a link to a valid .swu image -r &lt;retries&gt; integer Active only if CONFIG_DOWNLOAD is set Number of retries before a download is considered broken. With “-r 0”, SWUpdate will not stop until a valid software is loaded. -e &lt;sel&gt; string sel is in the format &lt;software&gt;,&lt;mode&gt; It allows to find a subset of rules in the sw-description file. With it, multiple rules are allowed. One common usage is in case of the dual copy approach. Example: -e “stable, copy1” ==&gt; install on copy1 -e “stable, copy2” ==&gt; install on copy2 -h run usage with help -k string Active if CONFIG_SIGNED is set Filename with the public key -s run SWUpdate in daemon mode -i &lt;file&gt; string run SWUpdate with a local .swu file -v activate verbose output -w &lt;parms&gt; string start internal webserver and pass to it a command line string. -u &lt;parms&gt; string start internal suricatta client daemon and pass to it a command line string. see suricatta’s documentation for details. -H &lt;board:rev&gt; string set board name and Hardware revision -t &lt;timeout&gt; integer Timeout for connection lost when downloading Changes in boot-loader code¶ The SWUpdate consists of kernel and a root filesystem (image) that must be started by the boot-loader. In case using U-Boot, the following mechanism can be implemented: U-Boot checks if a sw update is required (check gpio, serial console, etc.). the script “altbootcmd” sets the rules to start SWUpdate in case SWUpdate is required, u-boot run the script “altbootcmd” Is it safe to change U-Boot environment ? Well, it is, but U-Boot must be configured correctly. U-Boot supports two copies of the environment to be power-off safe during a an evironment update. The board’s configuration file must have defined CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_REDUND or CONFIG_ENV_ADDR_REDUND. Check in U-Boot documentation for these constants and how to use them. There are a further enhancement that can be optionally integrated into u-boot to make the system safer. The most important I will suggest is to add support for boot counter in u-boot (documentation is in U-Boot docs). This allows U-Boot to track for attempts to successfully run the application, and if the boot counter is greater as a limit, can start automatically SWUpdate to replace a corrupt software. Building a single image¶ cpio is used as container for its simplicity. The resulting image is very simple to be built. The file describing the images (“sw-description”, but the name can be configured) must be the first file in the cpio archive. To produce an image, a script like this can be used: CONTAINER_VER=&quot;1.0&quot; PRODUCT_NAME=&quot;my-software&quot; FILES=&quot;sw-description image1.ubifs \ image2.gz.u-boot uImage.bin myfile sdcard.img&quot; for i in $FILES;do echo $i;done | cpio -ov -H crc &gt; ${PRODUCT_NAME}_${CONTAINER_VER}.swu The single images can be put in any order inside the cpio container, with the exception of sw-description, that must be the first one.

                   NS1:content=" Take a look at this article. Although none is a 100% replacement of onenote functionality, you'll find there are some impressive apps. tl;dr Here's the list: BasKet is a note taking software that has a number of features for taking notes and organizing data. Zim Wiki – a Desktop Wiki, is a wonderful tool for taking notes. It does not behave anything like any traditional note taking software or Microsoft OneNote. Rather, it works like a wiki. Tomboy is a cool note taking software which is installed by default in many Linux distributions. CherryTree is a cross platform hierarchical note taking software. MyNotex is an upcoming note taking software in Linux that supports a number of features that are ideal for taking notes. KeepNote is designed to be a general note taking software that can be used in many different ways depending on the user’s needs. TuxCards is another note taking software which is quite impressive. Kjots is a very good note taking software. Recently, it has been rewritten grounds up using Qt 4 libraries. It is very quick to start up in GNOME even though it is essentially a KDE application. RedNotebook is more of a personal diary and journal than a note taking software. A simple note taking software written primarily for GNOME/Gtk-2, GJots2 is quite lean in features. Knowit is a note taking software catering to people who want to store text snippets as notes. NoteCase is a hierarchical notes manager (Outliner). It supports rich text editing and image insertion. Wixi – This is a multi-platform wiki application for the desktop. It is written in python/wxpython and uses txt2tags to generate text to many other formats. The goal is to provide a simple wiki tool around the txt2tags document generator and also be multi-platform. Memoranda – This is a free personal diary and scheduling tool. However, it can be used to keep notes. It contains a notes tab which has a rich text editor built-in. You can insert images and use different styles of text as well. If none of these covers your needs, there is the last resort of installing and running onenote through wine. I have read reports of success for the 2007 version but I have no idea about how the newer versions fare in that respe "

Mounting a File System To attach a certain file system, use the mount command in the following form: mount [option…] device directory When the mount command is run, it reads the content of the /etc/fstab configuration file to see if the given file system is listed. This file contains a list of device names and the directory in which the selected file systems should be mounted, as well as the file system type and mount options. Because of this, when you are mounting a file system that is specified in this file, you can use one of the following variants of the command: mount [option…] directory mount [option…] device Note that unless you are logged in as root, you must have permissions to mount the file system (see Section 2.2.2, “Specifying the Mount Options”). ⁠2.2.1. Specifying the File System Type In most cases, mount detects the file system automatically. However, there are certain file systems, such as NFS (Network File System) or CIFS (Common Internet File System), that are not recognized, and need to be specified manually. To specify the file system type, use the mount command in the following form: mount -t type device directory Table 2.1, “Common File System Types” provides a list of common file system types that can be used with the mount command. For a complete list of all available file system types, consult the relevant manual page as referred to in Section 2.4.1, “Installed Documentation”. ⁠ Table 2.1. Common File System Types Type Description ext2 The ext2 file system. ext3 The ext3 file system. ext4 The ext4 file system. iso9660 The ISO 9660 file system. It is commonly used by optical media, typically CDs. jfs The JFS file system created by IBM. nfs The NFS file system. It is commonly used to access files over the network. nfs4 The NFSv4 file system. It is commonly used to access files over the network. ntfs The NTFS file system. It is commonly used on machines that are running the Windows operating system. udf The UDF file system. It is commonly used by optical media, typically DVDs. vfat The FAT file system. It is commonly used on machines that are running the Windows operating system, and on certain digital media such as USB flash drives or floppy disks. See Example 2.2, “Mounting a USB Flash Drive” for an example usage. ⁠ Example 2.2. Mounting a USB Flash Drive Older USB flash drives often use the FAT file system. Assuming that such drive uses the /dev/sdc1 device and that the /media/flashdisk/ directory exists, you can mount it to this directory by typing the following at a shell prompt as root: ~]# mount -t vfat /dev/sdc1 /media/flashdisk Prev Next Red Hat Quick Links Downloads Subscriptions Support Cases Product Documentation Help Contact Us Log-in Assistance Accessibility Browser Support Policy Site Info Awards and Recognition Colophon Customer Portal FAQ About Red Hat Subscription Value About Red Hat Red Hat Jobs Related Sites RedHat.com JBoss.org OpenShift.com Red Hat Partner Connect Red Hat SummitDevNationTwitterFacebookGoogle+ Privacy Policy Customer Portal Terms of Use All Policies and Guidelines Copyright © 2016 Red Hat, Inc.

Training Certification Events Webinars Community Participate Q&amp;A Forums Blogs Resources Newsletter Distributions Publications Infographics Photos Videos Ben Martin June 24, 2013 Getting Started With the BeagleBone Black: A 1GHz ARM Linux Machine for $45 The BeagleBone Black (BBB) provides a 1GHz ARM Cortex-A8 with 512Mb of RAM and 2Gb of eMMC flash from which you can run a GNU/Linux system around a 3.8 Linux Kernel. Throw ethernet, HDMI, and a load of IO pins into the mix and you have a little machine that straddles the border between embedded Linux and the Arduino world. The Black is the latest addition to the Beagle series of ARM-based, single-board computers and is based on the BeagleBone before it. The package I got with the BBB contained the board and a single USB cable. You can power the BBB over the USB cable from a HUB so a dedicated power brick is not a necessity. BeagleBone Black, with LED lighted.Looking at the rows of 46 pins on each side of the BBB indicates that the board is very useful for many hardware projects. Depending on how you configure your BBB you can have up to 65 general-purpose, digital IO pins, 8 PWMs, 4 timers, 7 1.8V analog inputs, some serial UARTs, 2 I2C, and 2 SPI along with access to 3.3V and 5V. Some of the pins can be used for multiple purposes. For example, pin 17 on one header serves as a digital IO pin, an I2C, and an SPI pin, so you have to choose for which purpose you want to use it. The two header blocks on the BBB are referred to as the P8 and P9. The HDMI output on the BBB is implemented by bringing a &quot;cape&quot; onto the main board. Capes are what the Beagle community calls the cards, which can be attached to the pin headers, similar to what are called Shields in the Arduino world. The HDMI output on the BBB uses a collection of the general-purpose output pins from the two headers on the BBB. Specifically, it wants 3 SPI pins on header P9 and 30 pins on the P8 header. So if you have an HDMI display then you lose about 2/3 of the pins on the P9 header. More disturbing, if you are planning to output to a 1080 display you can only get a 24Hz output at that resolution (Page 68 of the System Reference Manual). Though that limitation has changed over software revisions. Getting Started with the BeagleBone Black When I first booted the BBB I got a graphical display over its HDMI but I couldn't get any mouse or keyboard to work on any USB port with either a passive or powered hub. That was when I decided I needed to update to the latest software before proceeding. The first step in updating the Linux distribution on the eMMC of the BBB is to download the Angstrom Distribution eMMC flasher from the Latest Images. Use unxz to uncompress the downloaded image and dd to write it to a microSD card. Many of the directions, including those that came on my BBB itself are very Windows-centric. Once you have written the roughly 4GB image to a microSD card, turn off the BBB, insert the card into the BBB, and apply power while holding the &quot;boot&quot; button which is on the opposite side of the BBB from where the microSD card plugs in. During flashing, the LEDs will flash and when done all the LEDs will remain on. For me, the flashing procedure took around an hour to complete. After updating the eMMC I found that if I booted the BBB with a network cable plugged in, I never got HDMI output. To get a display I had to boot without the network cable and then plug in the network cable to gain network access. Power wise, the BBB drew 2.7 Watts sitting idle at a 720p desktop with a passive hub, keyboard and mouse connected but without a network connection. Plugging in an ethernet cable boosted the draw to 3.2 W. Running the CPU at 100 percent moved to 3.9 W total. Disconnecting the hub (and thus keyboard and mouse) dropped the power draw by 0.8 W. How to Use the GPIO Pins Access to the various pins in the headers on the left and right side of the BBB is done through the Linux kernel using its GPIO Interfaces. To demonstrate how to give this a spin I attached an LED from pin 42 (GPIO_7) to the ground pin 44 next to it. That is the red LED shown in the photo, above. The BBB booted up without the LED lit. To get the LED to shine you have to map the GPIO_7 pin into the filesystem. This is done by echoing the GPIO pin into the export file. As you can see, below, I created the new gpio7 link using the export file in order to control that pin. The value is initially zero but when I echo high into the direction the LED lit up! root@bbb:/sys/class/gpio# echo 7 &gt; /sys/class/gpio/export root@bbb:/sys/class/gpio# ls -lh total 0 --w------- 1 root root 4.0K Jun 1 10:54 export lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jun 1 10:54 gpio7 -&gt; ../../devices/virtual/gpio/gpio7 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 1 2000 gpiochip0 -&gt; ../../devices/virtual/gpio/gpiochip0 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 1 2000 gpiochip32 -&gt; ../../devices/virtual/gpio/gpiochip32 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 1 2000 gpiochip64 -&gt; ../../devices/virtual/gpio/gpiochip64 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 1 2000 gpiochip96 -&gt; ../../devices/virtual/gpio/gpiochip96 --w------- 1 root root 4.0K Jan 1 2000 unexport root@bbb:/sys/class/gpio# cd gpio7 root@bbb:/sys/class/gpio/gpio7# cat value 0 root@bbb:/sys/class/gpio/gpio7# echo low &gt; direction root@bbb:/sys/class/gpio/gpio7# echo high &gt; direction To use GPIO pins that are not connected to the first gpio controller chip (which controls 32 pins), you should refer to the Expansion Header Pinout table in the System Reference Manual to calculate the correct number to echo into the exports file. For example GPIO_51 on pin 16 of the P9 header is gpio1[19]. This makes it the 19th pin on the second gpio controller so you would echo 32+19=51 into the exports file to access GPIO_51. One issue I encountered with the hardware design is that the large USB port on the BBB is very close to the microHDMI port which is attached to the other side of the board. The common combination of plugging in cables to both ports left the cable sleaves pushing each other slightly. In my next article on the BBB I'll show benchmarks for its CPU, along with performance figures for the eMMC flash that comes on the board.

As a skill, it is very hard to maintain, continuos training and practice is needed along with endless resources of paper. Recent Project Maazif is a music critic webstie dedicated for arabic music. With all the waves of change happening in the arab world, a back-to-our-roots mentality is becoming more popular, the younger generations are becoming more proud of their culture and heritage, therefore the identity had to reflect an authentic arabic brand to support the same message. Other Projects I’ve also designed a variety of projects that included Arabic calligraphy as a piller to communicate the brand, each of the projects required a different perspective into the calligraphy style, some are hand drawn and some are computer engineered, depending on the required outcome, yet they all reflect and Arabic brand in their own interpretations. Calligraphy Tools Other than the skill required, tools to get the job done can vary, each tool produces a different effect and serves a different purpose. There is no limit for the kind of tool to use, the beauty of it is improvisation and experimentation that might result in unexpected outcomes, for instance a flat wooden spoon.

                   NS1:content=" Using a ZTE MF180 on GNU/Linux with wvdial To use a &quot;ZTE MF180 HSDPA USB Stick&quot; (a device typically retailed by network providers like the Austrian bob as the &quot;bob datenstick&quot; (bob data stick)) on a (e.g Debian) GNU/Linux system, these instructions worked for me. Please note that some of the commads I send to the device were from somewhere in the internet (links given where relevant) or even guessed. They worked for me, but might turn your device into a useless brick! Step 1: Identify device When first connecting the stick, it presents itself as as CD-ROM device after a few seconds. dmesg shows: [...] usb 1-3: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 45 [...] usb 1-3: New USB device found, idVendor=19d2, idProduct=2000 [...] usb 1-3: New USB device strings: Mfr=3, Product=2, SerialNumber=4 [...] usb 1-3: Product: ZTE WCDMA Technologies MSM [...] usb 1-3: Manufacturer: ZTE,Incorporated [...] usb 1-3: SerialNumber: MF1800ZTED010000 [...] scsi46 : usb-storage 1-3:1.0 [...] scsi 46:0:0:0: CD-ROM ZTE USB SCSI CD-ROM 2.31 PQ: 0 ANSI: 2 [...] sr0: scsi-1 drive [...] sr 46:0:0:0: Attached scsi CD-ROM sr0 [...] sr 46:0:0:0: Attached scsi generic sg1 type 5 and lsusb lists it as: Bus 001 Device 045: ID 19d2:2000 ONDA Communication S.p.A. ZTE MF627/MF628/MF628+ HSDPA (Of course, som details will differ from system to system.) This CD typically contains vendor specific Windows drivers; you might want to look for a fitting icon there if you intend to create a graphical button for launching wvdial. At this stage, the LED on the device should be red. Step 2: Get rid of the CD thing In order to access the modem proper, you'll need to signal to the stick that it may switch now. Fortunately, on this particular stick this is implemented in a quite straigt-forward way -- simply eject the CD: eject /dev/sr0 After ejecting, three new devices will show up at ls /dev/ttyUSB*: /dev/ttyUSB0 /dev/ttyUSB1 /dev/ttyUSB2 The important one is /dev/ttyUSB2. According to an ubuntuforums entry, /dev/ttyUSB0 is a NMEA port (which I have not yet seen doing anything) and /dev/ttyUSB1 is for montioring (e.g. querying signal strength while a connection is open). At this stage, the LED should still be red. You can now communicate with the device using AT commands, e.g. by using screen /dev/ttyUSB2. For example, you can query the security status by entering AT+ZSEC?: AT+ZSEC? +ZSEC: 0,0 OK (That is, you enter AT+ZSEC?, followed by return, and the stick responds with a status and an OK message. You can leave the screen session by pressing Ctrl-a, k, and y. If screen complains about &quot;Cannot access line&quot;, you might need to invoke it with sudo.) The exact interpretation of the ZSEC reply is explained in the 3g-modem wiki, but for now it will be sufficient to know that 0,0 means that no PIN has been entered. Disabling CD mode There are two parameters that can be set: &quot;autorun&quot; and &quot;download&quot;. Autorun can be enabled using AT+ZCDRUN=9, disabled using AT+ZCDRUN=8 and queried using AT+ZCDRUN=4. [1] Download mode can be enabled using AT+ZCDRUN=E, disabled using AT+ZCDRUN=F and queried using AT+ZCDRUN=G. [2] Enabling download mode works best for me as it hides the CD completely. (Autorun mode just makes both the ttyUSB and the CD show up at the same time.) Step 3: Unlock the SIM card Before the modem accepts any commands from wvdial to set up the modem connection, it needs the SIM card unlocked by entering the PIN (where 1234 is your PIN): AT+CPIN=1234 OK The LED will then turn blue after a few seconds, and AT+ZSEC? will then receive the response 3,0. LED color It might happen that you LED remains red or goes back to red after some time, or goes to green. This seems to be due to bad network connectivity; AT+ZPAS? reported &quot;Limited Service&quot; instead of &quot;UMTS&quot;,&quot;CS_PS&quot; for me iff the LED was red, and &quot;GPRS&quot;,&quot;CS_PS&quot; iff the LED was green. Disabling the PIN To use the wvdial configuration below, you need to allow the SIM card to connect without a password. Disable password prompting by issuing AT+CLCK=&quot;SC&quot;,0,&quot;1234&quot; (again, for you PIN being 1234). You can re-enable it using AT+CLCK=&quot;SC&quot;,1,&quot;1234&quot;. The more secure version would be writing a chat script that enters the pin and polls for the response to AT+ZSEC? or AT+ZPAS? to indicate that everything is ready. Step 4: Get a network connection After the device is unlocked and connected to the network, a pretty straightforward /etc/wvdial.conf setting for wvdial is required to get things running; I use this: [Dialer bobstick] Phone = *99# Username = data@bob.at Password = ppp Init2 = AT+CGDCONT=4,&quot;IP&quot;,&quot;bob.at&quot; Modem = /dev/ttyUSB2 Stupid Mode = 1 The Phone, Username and Password parts, the &quot;bob.at&quot; section in the Init2 (that's the APN) and the &quot;Stupid Mode&quot; are specific to bob; instructions what to put there should come with your SIM card. Then, start wvdial bobstick (you might need sudo again, and don't forget to close screen sessions running on /dev/ttyUSB2 as they'll eat the stick's responses): --&gt; WvDial: Internet dialer version 1.60 --&gt; Cannot get information for serial port. --&gt; Initializing modem. --&gt; Sending: ATZ ATZ OK --&gt; Sending: AT+CGDCONT=4,&quot;IP&quot;,&quot;bob.at&quot; AT+CGDCONT=4,&quot;IP&quot;,&quot;bob.at&quot; OK --&gt; Modem initialized. --&gt; Sending: ATDT*99# --&gt; Waiting for carrier. ATDT*99# CONNECT 3600000 --&gt; Carrier detected. Starting PPP immediately. --&gt; Starting pppd at [...] --&gt; Pid of pppd: 22867 --&gt; Using interface ppp0 --&gt; local IP address [...] [...] And there you go, network up and running! The LED should be blinking now. If you want to further interact with the device, use screen /dev/ttyUSB1 as ttyUSB2 is now in use by PPP. Step 5: Reset (Remember what I said about bricking? That's the part where I guessed brutally.) When a connection is active, just stopping wvdial is not enough to make the connection stop on the stick's side -- the LED keeps blinking. Sending the command AT+ZRST resets the device. More commands and devices jtrenchard found some more commands in the binary code of a similar dongle, e.g. a AT+ZVN which I guess stants for &quot;ZTE version&quot; and reports &quot;BD_MF180TLF3V1.0.0B01 [JUNE 8 2010 17:00:00]&quot; for me. The AT+ZRST very much looks like a reset command (as does AT+ZOPRT=0), AT+ZECC? returns US and European emergency numbers. Similar devices probably have different tty numbers.

Within this environment there are plenty of applications and utilities. In your projects you may want to auto-load one or more of these applications when you run startx to save you having to launch them manually. Popular choices might include LXTerminal, Scratch, Midori and Leafpad. There are two methods you can choose. For most people either one will work but if in doubt use Method 1. In the examples below I’ve added two applications (LXTerminal and Leafpad) but you can add however many you need. Start by booting your Pi to the command prompt. Method 1 This method uses a global list of autostart applications that applies to all user accounts. They will load whenever LXDE is loaded regardless of what user is logged in at the time. Usually this user is the default ‘Pi’ account. Use the following command to launch the nano text editor and edit the autostart file : sudo nano /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart Note : The newer Raspbian image changed the folder “LXDE” to “LXDE-pi” so the line above has been updated. After the last line add a line for each application you wish to autorun. For example if I add lines for LXTerminal and Leafpad my file looks like this : @lxpanel --profile LXDE @pcmanfm --desktop --profile LXDE @lxterminal @leafpad @xscreensaver -no-splash@ To save and exit the nano editor press CTRL-X, Y and then ENTER. You can use your preferred text editor if nano isn’t your first choice. Method 2 The alternative method is to create a configuration file that is unique to the currently logged in user. First you need to edit this text file : sudo nano ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE/autostart As in Method 1 this file represents a list of commands to be executed when the GUI loads. It is usually blank when you first edit it so just add the applications you need to auto-load: @lxterminal @leafpad To save and exit the nano editor press CTRL-X, Y and then ENTER. Test Once your configuration file has been updated you are ready to test. startx The LXDE desktop should load and your chosen applications should launch. Both Methods At The Same Time? Since v0.4.9 If both files are present, lxsession only executes the local file. This means you can no longer use both methods at the same time. Method 2 will take priority over Method 1. Auto-run Minecraft Assuming you have already installed Minecraft on your Pi you can auto-run it as well. When I am in a Python-Minecraft mood I launch Minecraft and a terminal window ready for executing scripts using the following lines : @~/mcpi/minecraft-pi @lxterminal This assume the Minecraft executable is located in ~/mcpi/ (same as /home/pi/mcpi/). Auto-run Python Scripts You can auto-launch your own Python scripts by adding the line : @/usr/bin/python /home/pi/example.py This works best with Method 2 as in this example the Python script is stored in the home directory of the default Pi user. If another user is logged in they wouldn’t have access to this directory so LXDE may not be able to autoload it. Whichever method you used just type startx from the command line and your chosen applications should load automatically. LXDE Desktop Note 1 : The order that you place the application commands doesn’t always mean they will load in that order as different applications will take different amounts of time to load completely. I would tend to put the larger applications first so they have as much time as possible to fire up. i.e. Midori before LXTerminal. Note 2 : Make sure your commands come before the @xscreensaver line.

I’d like to be able to get a python script that outputs text (generated from sensor outputs) to automatically run in a terminal window. Is there an easy way to accomplish that? Reply Matt on May 4, 2014 10:16 am It runs in the background … but you can launch LXTerminal instead and pass it a command line parameter to run a Python script. Haven’t tested it but you could try something like : @lxterminal -e ‘/usr/bin/python /home/pi/myscript.py’ -t ‘MyTitle’ Reply Paul Adomshick on May 6, 2014 4:13 am Much appreciated. I’ll try that. Reply AJ on December 2, 2015 3:35 am IMPORTANT: this line has to be added before the @xscreensaver line. Finally worked for me after reading about that here: https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=91&amp;t=65607 Reply Matt on December 3, 2015 7:23 pm Thanks, I’ve added a note at the bottom of the post. Reply Don Sorensen on May 4, 2014 8:16 pm Looks like a “code” tag got misplaces in your first snippet above. I’m pretty sure the lines “To save and exit the nano editor press CTRL-X, Y and then ENTER. You can use your preferred text editor if nano isn’t your first choice.” don’t belong in the autostart file. I’m sorry if it sounds picky, but I’ve been fighting the way Wordpad puts tags into posts for about a week now. Thought you’d like to know. Great site you’ve got here. Thank you for going through the trouble. Reply Matt on May 4, 2014 8:45 pm Thanks Don. I spotted that just before I published it … then obviously forgot to actually correct it! Thanks for pointing it out. It’s sorted now. Reply Jeremy on January 11, 2015 7:23 pm I couldn’t figure out why I couldn’t get this to work. In the latest raspbian image I downloaded (around Dec 30, 2014) they changed the path for the autostart file that is used. This in method #1: sudo nano /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart is now this: sudo nano /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart I hope that saves someone some time. Reply goodsayan on January 12, 2015 11:15 am folder LXDE has changed, Thanks Jeremy! Reply Claudio on January 13, 2015 11:18 pm THANK YOU! This saved me really time! Reply Daniel on January 16, 2015 3:29 am As Jeremy was saying, with the changes to the new image for Raspbian, it also effect the per user basis. I tried to figure it out for hours why my apps were not auto starter per user and you have to change the folder ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE to ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi for it to work properly. Hopes this helps. Reply Ben on January 17, 2015 2:28 pm Thanks Jeremy – I am trying to use the user autostart (to start pipresents on startup) and it didn’t work until i created: ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart Reading the above I guess this is new – I downloaded and installed NOOBS today, 17th Jan 2015. Hope this helps. Reply Carlos on February 18, 2015 9:39 pm Thanks all, I was having issues with this as well… I had set the pi to autostart into GUI (thru raspi-config) and all the instructions never made this work!!! However, figured out that if I disabled the autostart into GUI (via raspi-config) and run the command startx, it started working… any ideas how to make it boot the pi into GUI and have auto start of an application. My second issue is that I can now see my python script trying to execute (by running startx manually), but can’t start since input() has an EOF error… so I basically want to boot to GUI and ready for keyboard input. Something relatively easy, but has been taking me several days to figure because of all the oddities of Raspian/Pi Thanks, -Carlos Reply David van Wyk on February 24, 2015 3:07 pm Hi Guys, I am busy with an application that utilises the GPIO and it needs root priviliges, but I want it to auto start on boot. Do I need something extra, as on the command line ‘sudo’? I usually have to open the current folder as root and then I can start my application by double clicking. The above code doesn’t start my application up. Thanks. Reply Howard on April 14, 2015 10:09 am I used the following command to change the file ownership to pi and switch back to root afterward. chown pi:pi [filename] Reply David van Wyk on June 7, 2015 10:15 am Howard, I am not quite with you? I have since also upgraded to the Rpi 2B, but still having trouble starting my app. Now on the Rpi 2B I cant switch a window to root user, the option was removed. So my app doesn’t even start on normal double click anymore. It only runs if I remove gpio references from the code. How do I run a GUI with GPIO (root privileges) on Rpi 2B and more especially how can I autostart the app. I changed the file ownership to root, still doesnt work. Reply Henry Hansel on February 25, 2015 12:05 pm I too have been battling this on a RPI2 running Rasbian. My app uses GPIO and tkinter so I need X running. My intention is to auto boot to desktop and then for my application to launch covering the OS like a virtual machine. Strange behavior is that after locating the path .config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/ and creating my autostart file my python program will auto launch about 50% of the time on boot. I have not been able to determine why it will not the other times? I hope that someone can finally put a nail in this, I am dead in the water with this project until I can get 100% autostart to work. Thanks for all the input. Henry Reply Henry Hansel on March 1, 2015 12:01 pm Finally, I think that I have got autostart to work 100% of the time. I had to modify my autostart file in /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart to read: @/usr/bin/python3.2/myscript.py myscript.py resides in home/pi I added python3.2 for it to work, apparently it was trying to run my python3 script with python2 even though the shebang statement at the top of the script calls for python3. I am a linux noob so any insight on why this works would be appreciated. Henry Reply Ashley Burt on March 17, 2015 8:03 pm I just put the commands I needed to autorun into the users .profile in their home directory. Worked like a champ. Reply Rebecca on April 11, 2015 4:51 pm Is it possible to have multiple python scripts set to run at the start up of the GUI? I have tried just adding in another @/usr/bin/python /home/pi/example.py line to the autostart file but it doesn’t run the second python script Reply Frank on October 6, 2015 2:35 pm I was having issues trying to get the R Pi2 to launch a website on boot I ended up making the change to this config file to make it work sudo nano /home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart It worked like a charm. I had a hard time finding this solution and i hope it helps others. Reply Sal on October 26, 2015 5:18 am Frank thank you spent hours and hours looking for this solution, editing sudo nano /home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart Worked perfect! THANKS!!!! Reply Mark Baker on October 28, 2015 3:15 pm I’ve modified /home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart adding @xfreerdp server1 to automatically start a RDP session to a terminal server. It works perfectly if I manually login as pi but as soon as I reconfigure it to automatically login as pi into the desktop it stops working. If I add @leafpad to the autostart file it works but not the @xfreerdp Any suggestions? Reply Peter Triandafillou on January 24, 2016 10:42 pm This thread has been very helpful – thanks to all the contributors. I have a question: I added a line to start an lxterminal to run my program, and it works. However, my program accesses a Sense Hat, and it needs to start with sudo to run properly. Is there a way to specify the user password in the autostart line so that it doesn’t need to be entered? I’m developing an application that would be better off without a keyboard. Thanks! Reply Alex Cahill on February 11, 2016 10:59 pm Annonyingly I took me 2 days to figure out that method 1 no longer works. https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/LXDE#Autostart “Note: If both files are present, lxsession only executes the local file as of v0.4.9” Reply Matt on February 15, 2016 8:27 pm Method should work as long as there are no local files defined. Thanks for the tip, I’ve modified the article to mention the local file take priority over the global file. Reply Peter on February 23, 2016 12:54 pm I have a small problem. I want to autostart two programs and of cause it works with mentioned method no.1. The problem is, I want to start them in two different virtuell desktops, unfortunately both programs are starting only on one desktop and I really do not find a way to start on the defined desktops. Any idea?

                   NS1:content="­ Menu DIY How to Choose and Optimise Your Raspberry Pi Browser Written by Christian Cawley September 18, 2013 How to Choose and Optimise Your Raspberry Pi Browser Ads by Google Whatever your current Raspberry Pi project, you might need to access the web. Unfortunately, speedy browsing isn’t a strength of this small computer – is there any way to speed things up? Thankfully, there are several methods you can use, depending on your chosen browser. For instance, if you’re using the Raspbian distro (and as the most popular option among many, we’ll assume you are) then you will have the Midori browser pre-installed. Although useful, this browser doesn’t really offer much in terms of speed. So what should you do? Is there a better browser that Raspberry Pi users might find more useful? Why Using The Right Browser Is Important The chances are that if you’re using the Raspberry Pi for web browsing, you’re probably doing so as part of your software development work rather than using the little computer as a desktop PC. As good as Midori is, the general inability of web developers to code JavaScript concisely, economically and correctly can lead to problems with many sites failing to open correctly or in a timely manner on the Pi as the CPU gets tied up with a lot of largely unnecessary processing work. Using the right browser – hopefully something light on resources but fast on page load times – will help you to be more efficient with your web browsing. Ads by Google Top Browser Options For The Raspberry Pi There are four different Linux browsers that can be used with the Raspberry Pi. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, but it’s arguable that only one of these is really suitable. Midori This is a default browser that is found in Raspbian and all distros and builds based on this OS. muo-rpi-browser-midori NetSurf An alternative to Midori, also found in Raspbian. This is a faster option, and does a reasonably good job rendering “complex” web pages, in general (although as you can see it struggles with the new MakeUseOf home page). muo-rpi-browser-netsurf Lynx Super fast if you want a text-based web browsing experience, Lynx isn’t ideal for everyone. Install using sudo apt-get install lynx. Although it is added to the Other menu, you should run the browser from LXTerminal with the command lynx. muo-rpi-browser-lynx Chromium The Raspberry Pi’s version of the Chromium browser is fast and impressive, and can be installed using sudo apt-get install chromium. A drawback with this browser is that it isn’t as lightweight as the others and will max out your Pi’s processor. muo-rpi-browser-chromium Luakit This is a lightweight and configurable browser that many Raspberry Pi users are now using in preference to Midori. Install with sudo apt-get install luakit. muo-rpi-browser-luakit Configuration Tips For Midori Although Luakit, WebSurf and Lynx are all pretty fast browsers (albeit limited in the case of Lynx!) some useful configuration tips can be employed to get the most out of Midori. In Midori, open Settings &gt; Preferences to make some changes to how the browser behaves. For instance, on the Startup tab, When Midori starts is set to Show last open tabs, which can result in a bit of a wait for the browser to load. To avoid this, switch to Show Speed Dial or Show last tabs without loading. In the Behaviour tab, you should toggle the Load images automatically, Enable scripts and Enable Netscape plugins options to decide whether you want those items active – disabling will speed things up, but may not improve your browsing experience. muo-rpi-browser-midoriprefs Finally on the Privacy tab, use the Enable offline web application cache and Enable HTML5 local storage support options to speed up caching. Shortcomings Of Raspberry Pi Web Browsers While the tips above can be used to improve browsing on the Raspberry Pi, there is a very important element to all of this that cannot be underlined enough: These browsers might be useful, they might be fast at loading certain pages, but they are absolutely useless for loading webpages and content relying on Adobe Flash, such as games and video streaming services. Similarly, websites that use AJAX for formatting and providing live updates (such as Facebook, various newspaper websites, etc.) should also be avoided unless you’re prepared for a wait. Note that NetSurf defaults to mobile versions of such sites – and even then the results can be sluggish. Gmail, too, cannot be used except in HTML mode, and even then you can expect a bit of a wait for the page to load. Some JavaScript is supported by these browsers, but as this code is often used to launch more demanding scripts and content, you should overall not expect to be able to use your Raspberry Pi browser in the same way as you can use a Windows, Mac or standard Linux browser. Customise Midori, Or Rely On Alternatives Although the Midori browser comes as default with the Raspbian distro, speed aside, it is no better or worse than the others and is prone to failure with certain websites. By contrast, NetSurf and Luakit are far better alternatives. What do you think? Is Midori sufficient for your Raspberry Pi browsing needs, or do you use any of the alternatives listed here? Should the Raspbian distro start offering more alternatives to Midori? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.

I want to completely uninstall Midori, or just change the settings for the default application to surf the web. I got LuaKit, and I want to make this the default application for using the web. Could anyone help? Thanks! Anonymous. Reply JK 20 February, 2015 How about Dillo? Reply Bill 6 December, 2013 After trying all of the browsers that come with Raspi to display graphics using the shape, none worked. I downloaded Chromium, and it worked fine. You’re no doubt right about using a lot of memory, but I’m working up some experiments using PHP to see if I can dynamically drive svg “space ships”.

Oopz and Titeaz etc… As you can see, it employs HTML5 SVG, and it runs on my Raspi using Debian (Rasbian) OS–being fabulously wealthy, I got the Model B (Rev 2) version of Raspi.

I’ve created little app that had a frontend in jQuery, using CSS3 effects. Midori didn’t handle it and it was very slow. But Chromium did the job very well. I recommend it as it’s modern and runs faster on RPi.

Now u have to configure the pppd (must be installed first apt-get install ppp) I'm using the following command to activate my connection: pppd /dev/ttyUSB0 921600 mtu 552 mru 552 modem crtscts dump defaultroute noipdefault usepeerdns ktune noauth logfd 2 logfile / pppd.log lock persist holdoff 1 maxfail 20 connect &quot;/usr/sbin/chat -v -f /etc/ppp/connect_script&quot; U have to edit the dialer script with command nano /etc/ppp/ connect_script My script is this: # chat script ABORT 'NO CARRIER' ABORT 'NO DIALTONE' ABORT 'BUSY' ABORT 'ERROR' ABORT 'NO ANSWER' '' 'ATZ' OK 'AT&amp;F' OK 'ATQ0 V1 E1' OK 'AT&amp;D2 &amp;C1' OK 'AT+FCLASS=0' OK 'ATS0=0' # repalce internet.vodafone.pt with ur provider OK 'AT+CGDCONT=1,&quot;IP&quot;,&quot;internet.vodafone.pt&quot;' # make sure the dial number for ur operator data mode is *99# OK 'ATDT*99#' CONNECT '' After u have this script with ur provider and correct dial number u can use the pppd command to get connected as I said before. U can also see the log of pppd to see if everything went allright with command cat /pppd.log Then u do an ifconfig and u will see ur new ppp connection with the IP of mobile dongle. U could also use sakis3G to get connected in a easier way http://wiki.sakis3g.org/wiki/index.php?title=Sakis3G_installation sakis3g connect APN=&quot;internet&quot; APN_USER=&quot;&quot; APN_PASS=&quot;&quot; USBDRIVER=&quot;option&quot; MODEM=&quot;OTHER&quot; OTHER=&quot;CUSTOM_TTY&quot; CUSTOM_TTY=&quot;/dev/ ttyUSB0&quot; SIM_PIN=&quot;xxxx&quot; Just repalce xxxx with pin and use ur APN provider ,user and pass or u can use interactive mode type command sakis3G connect -- interactive If u are using angstrom distribution on bone u will have more work to do get it connected, a good start is http://www.pandorawiki.org/USB_compatibility_list#HSDPA_.283G.29_Modems u can see some help to get dongles working, just collect ideas an u could have luck Regards Show trimmed content whoobee 18/09/2012 Other recipients: Great example @vitoracmm I got my Huavey E3131s-2 working with ubuntu demo image.

Post navigation ← Previous Next → BeagleBone and USB GSM Stick Posted on 19/11/2012 by Mark More sysadmin than electronics today! I have an O2 USB modem and I was wondering about getting the BeagleBone hooked up to it. It would be cool to have the BeagleBone “phone home” if is was out in the field logging, or whatever. Front side of my USB GSM modem As you can see form the photo of the back-side it’s a Huawei Mobile Broadband E1752C USB modem. The back side of the Huawei Mobile Broadband E1752C USB stick It turns out to be really easy to use this (or any other USB GSM modem) with Ubuntu. It a little “old school” without a GUI to work in, but hay, command line is king after all!.. It brings back memories of using pppd and chat scripts when I used Linux to connect over a copper phone line to the “Internet!”. On the O2 network here in Ireland my /etc/ppp/peers/o2 file looks like this: debug connect &quot;/usr/sbin/chat -v -f /etc/chatscripts/o2&quot; lock local user &quot;o2&quot; password &quot;o2&quot; ttyUSB0 noauth defaultroute noipdefault usepeerdns ipcp-max-failure 5 lcp-echo-failure 5 lcp-echo-interval 30 persist #auth refuse-chap refuse-mschap refuse-mschap-v2 refuse-eap # compression novjccomp nobsdcomp noaccomp nopcomp novj noccp And my chat script looks like this: ECHO ON TIMEOUT 10 ABORT 'BUSY' ABORT 'NO ANSWER' ABORT 'ERROR' ABORT 'NO CARRIER' &quot;&quot; AT OK AT+CPIN=XXXX TIMEOUT 5 ERROR-AT-OK AT+CGDCONT=1,&quot;IP&quot;,&quot;open.internet&quot; OK &quot;ATD*99#&quot; CONNECT &quot;&quot; Nice little trick here for the PIN entry.. You need it the first time the modem boots up, but not for re-connecting the “TIMEOUT 5 ERROR-AT-OK” will allow the PIN code to fail (because it already been entered) and not stop the script. As I want to remote connect to BeagleBone, I’ve got it to send it’s IP address back to base (every time the PPP interface comes up). You will need to set up shared SSH keys between your server and the Bone to get this to work without a password. Then I created the following little script ( /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/001updateIP ): #!/bin/sh # # scp the current IP address back to base... # (MMcK 2012-11-19) # /sbin/ifconfig -a \ | awk '/inet addr/ { print $2 }' \ | awk -F: '{ print $2 }' \ &gt; /tmp/bone.ipaddr /usr/bin/scp -q /tmp/bone.ipaddr &lt;me&gt;@&lt;my server&gt;: Now every time the Bone comes online over the PPP interface I can connect to it by looking up it’s new IP address.

By default, ProxyHandler uses the environment variables named &lt;scheme&gt;_proxy, where &lt;scheme&gt; is the URL scheme involved. For example, the http_proxy environment variable is read to obtain the HTTP proxy's URL. This example replaces the default ProxyHandler with one that uses programatically-supplied proxy URLs, and adds proxy authorization support with ProxyBasicAuthHandler. proxy_handler = urllib2.ProxyHandler({'http': 'http://www.example.com:3128/'}) proxy_auth_handler = urllib2.HTTPBasicAuthHandler() proxy_auth_handler.add_password('realm', 'host', 'username', 'password') opener = build_opener(proxy_handler, proxy_auth_handler) # This time, rather than install the OpenerDirector, we use it directly: opener.open('http://www.example.com/login.html') Adding HTTP headers: Use the headers argument to the Request constructor, or: import urllib2 req = urllib2.Request('http://www.example.com/') req.add_header('Referer', 'http://www.python.org/') r = urllib2.urlopen(req) OpenerDirector automatically adds a User-Agent: header to every Request.

Whether it be temperature, pressure, voltage, etc, their variation is always analog in nature. For example, the temperature inside a boiler is around 800°C. During its light-up, the temperature never approaches directly to 800°C. If the ambient temperature is 400°C, it will start increasing gradually to 450°C, 500°C and thus reaches 800°C over a period of time. This is an analog data. Signal Acquisition Process Signal Acquisition Process Now, we must process the data that we have received. But analog signal processing is quite inefficient in terms of accuracy, speed and desired output. Hence, we convert them to digital form using an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC). Signal Acquisition Process In general, the signal (or data) acquisition process has 3 steps. In the Real World, a sensor senses any physical parameter and converts into an equivalent analog electrical signal. For efficient and ease of signal processing, this analog signal is converted into a digital signal using an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC). This digital signal is then fed to the Microcontroller (MCU) and is processed accordingly. ADC Pins - ATMEGA16/32 ADC Pins – ATMEGA16/32 Interfacing Sensors In general, sensors provide with analog output, but a MCU is a digital one. Hence we need to use ADC. For simple circuits, comparator op-amps can be used. But even this won’t be required if we use a MCU. We can straightaway use the inbuilt ADC of the MCU. In ATMEGA16/32, PORTA contains the ADC pins. The ADC of the AVR The AVR features inbuilt ADC in almost all its MCU. In ATMEGA16/32, PORTA contains the ADC pins. Some other features of the ADC are as follows: ADC Features - ATMEGA16/32 ADC Features – ATMEGA16/32 Right now, we are concerned about the 8 channel 10 bit resolution feature. 8 channel implies that there are 8 ADC pins are multiplexed together. You can easily see that these pins are located across PORTA (PA0…PA7). 10 bit resolution implies that there are 2^10 = 1024 steps (as described below). 8 channel 10 bit ADC 8 channel 10 bit ADC Suppose we use a 5V reference. In this case, any analog value in between 0 and 5V is converted into its equivalent ADC value as shown above. The 0-5V range is divided into 2^10 = 1024 steps. Thus, a 0V input will give an ADC output of 0, 5V input will give an ADC output of 1023, whereas a 2.5V input will give an ADC output of around 512. This is the basic concept of ADC. To those whom it might concern, the type of ADC implemented inside the AVR MCU is of Successive Approximation type. Apart from this, the other things that we need to know about the AVR ADC are: ADC Prescaler ADC Registers – ADMUX, ADCSRA, ADCH, ADCL and SFIOR ADC Prescaler The ADC of the AVR converts analog signal into digital signal at some regular interval. This interval is determined by the clock frequency. In general, the ADC operates within a frequency range of 50kHz to 200kHz. But the CPU clock frequency is much higher (in the order of MHz). So to achieve it, frequency division must take place. The prescaler acts as this division factor. It produces desired frequency from the external higher frequency. There are some predefined division factors – 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128. For example, a prescaler of 64 implies F_ADC = F_CPU/64. For F_CPU = 16MHz, F_ADC = 16M/64 = 250kHz. Now, the major question is… which frequency to select? Out of the 50kHz-200kHz range of frequencies, which one do we need? Well, the answer lies in your need. There is a trade-off between frequency and accuracy. Greater the frequency, lesser the accuracy and vice-versa. So, if your application is not sophisticated and doesn’t require much accuracy, you could go for higher frequencies. ADC Registers We will discuss the registers one by one. ADMUX – ADC Multiplexer Selection Register The ADMUX register is as follows. ADMUX ADMUX Register The bits that are highlighted are of interest to us. In any case, we will discuss all the bits one by one. Bits 7:6 – REFS1:0 – Reference Selection Bits – These bits are used to choose the reference voltage. The following combinations are used. Reference Voltage Selection Reference Voltage Selection ADC Voltage Reference Pins ADC Voltage Reference Pins The ADC needs a reference voltage to work upon. For this we have a three pins AREF, AVCC and GND. We can supply our own reference voltage across AREF and GND. For this, choose the first option. Apart from this case, you can either connect a capacitor across AREF pin and ground it to prevent from noise, or you may choose to leave it unconnected. If you want to use the VCC (+5V), choose the second option. Or else, choose the last option for internal Vref. Let’s choose the second option for Vcc = 5V. Bit 5 – ADLAR – ADC Left Adjust Result – Make it ‘1’ to Left Adjust the ADC Result. We will discuss about this a bit later. Bits 4:0 – MUX4:0 – Analog Channel and Gain Selection Bits – There are 8 ADC channels (PA0…PA7). Which one do we choose? Choose any one! It doesn’t matter. How to choose? You can choose it by setting these bits. Since there are 5 bits, it consists of 2^5 = 32 different conditions as follows. However, we are concerned only with the first 8 conditions. Initially, all the bits are set to zero. Input Channel and Gain Selections Input Channel and Gain Selections Thus, to initialize ADMUX, we write ADMUX = (1&lt;&lt;REFS0); ADCSRA – ADC Control and Status Register A The ADCSRA register is as follows. ADCSRA Register ADCSRA Register The bits that are highlighted are of interest to us. In any case, we will discuss all the bits one by one. Bit 7 – ADEN – ADC Enable – As the name says, it enables the ADC feature. Unless this is enabled, ADC operations cannot take place across PORTA i.e. PORTA will behave as GPIO pins. Bit 6 – ADSC – ADC Start Conversion – Write this to ‘1’ before starting any conversion. This 1 is written as long as the conversion is in progress, after which it returns to zero. Normally it takes 13 ADC clock pulses for this operation. But when you call it for the first time, it takes 25 as it performs the initialization together with it. Bit 5 – ADATE – ADC Auto Trigger Enable – Setting it to ‘1’ enables auto-triggering of ADC. ADC is triggered automatically at every rising edge of clock pulse. View the SFIOR register for more details. Bit 4 – ADIF – ADC Interrupt Flag – Whenever a conversion is finished and the registers are updated, this bit is set to ‘1’ automatically. Thus, this is used to check whether the conversion is complete or not. Bit 3 – ADIE – ADC Interrupt Enable – When this bit is set to ‘1’, the ADC interrupt is enabled. This is used in the case of interrupt-driven ADC. Bits 2:0 – ADPS2:0 – ADC Prescaler Select Bits – The prescaler (division factor between XTAL frequency and the ADC clock frequency) is determined by selecting the proper combination from the following. ADC Prescaler Selections ADC Prescaler Selections Assuming XTAL frequency of 16MHz and the frequency range of 50kHz-200kHz, we choose a prescaler of 128. Thus, F_ADC = 16M/128 = 125kHz. Thus, we initialize ADCSRA as follows. ADCSRA = (1&lt;&lt;ADEN)|(1&lt;&lt;ADPS2)|(1&lt;&lt;ADPS1)|(1&lt;&lt;ADPS0); // prescaler = 128 ADCL and ADCH – ADC Data Registers The result of the ADC conversion is stored here. Since the ADC has a resolution of 10 bits, it requires 10 bits to store the result. Hence one single 8 bit register is not sufficient. We need two registers – ADCL and ADCH (ADC Low byte and ADC High byte) as follows. The two can be called together as ADC. ADC Data Registers (ADLAR = 0) ADC Data Registers (ADLAR = 0) ADC Data Registers (ADLAR = 1) ADC Data Registers (ADLAR = 1) You can very well see the the effect of ADLAR bit (in ADMUX register). Upon setting ADLAR = 1, the conversion result is left adjusted. SFIOR – Special Function I/O Register In normal operation, we do not use this register. This register comes into play whenever ADATE (in ADCSRA) is set to ‘1’. The register goes like this. SFIOR Register SFIOR Register The bits highlighted in yellow will be discussed as they are related to ADATE. Other bits are reserved bits. Bits 7:5 – ADC Auto Trigger Source – Whenever ADATE is set to ‘1’, these bits determine the trigger source for ADC conversion. There are 8 possible trigger sources. ADC Auto Trigerring Source Selections ADC Auto Triggering Source Selections These options are will be discussed in the posts related to timers. Those who have prior knowledge of timers can use it. The rest can leave it for now, we won’t be using this anyway. ADC Initialization The following code segment initializes the ADC. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 void adc_init() { // AREF = AVcc ADMUX = (1&lt;&lt;REFS0); // ADC Enable and prescaler of 128 // 16000000/128 = 125000 ADCSRA = (1&lt;&lt;ADEN)|(1&lt;&lt;ADPS2)|(1&lt;&lt;ADPS1)|(1&lt;&lt;ADPS0); } Reading ADC Value The following code segment reads the value of the ADC. Always refer to the register description above for every line of code. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 uint16_t adc_read(uint8_t ch) { // select the corresponding channel 0~7 // ANDing with ’7′ will always keep the value // of ‘ch’ between 0 and 7 ch &amp;= 0b00000111; // AND operation with 7 ADMUX = (ADMUX &amp; 0xF8)|ch; // clears the bottom 3 bits before ORing // start single convertion // write ’1′ to ADSC ADCSRA |= (1&lt;&lt;ADSC); // wait for conversion to complete // ADSC becomes ’0′ again // till then, run loop continuously while(ADCSRA &amp; (1&lt;&lt;ADSC)); return (ADC); } Physical Connections Let’s connect two LDRs (Light Dependent Resistors) to pins PA0 and PA1 respectively. The connection is as follows. The function of potentiometers is explained in a later section, Sensor Calibration. You can scroll down to it. ;) LDR Connections LDR Connections Now suppose we want to display the corresponding ADC values in an LCD. So, we also need to connect an LCD to our MCU. Read this post to know about LCD interfacing. Since it is an LDR, it senses the intensity of light and accordingly change its resistance. The resistance decreases exponentially as the light intensity increases. Suppose we also want to light up an LED whenever the light level decreases. So, we can connect the LED to any one of the GPIO pins, say PC0. Note that since the ADC returns values in between 0 and 1023, for dark conditions, the value should be low (below 100 or 150) whereas for bright conditions, the value should be quite high (above 900). Now let’s write the complete code. Example Code To learn about LCD interfacing, view this post. You can type, compile and build it in AVR Studio 5. View this page to know how.

In the problem statement given earlier, I have mentioned that the LED should glow if the light intensity reduces. But when should it start to glow? The MCU/code doesn’t know by itself. You get the readings from the sensor continuously in between 0 and 1023. So, the question is how do we know that below ‘such and such’ level the LED should glow? This is achieved by calibration. You need to physically set this value. What you do is that you run the sensor for all the lighting conditions. You have the ADC values for all these levels. Now, you need to physically see and check the conditions yourself and then apply a threshold. Below this threshold, the light intensity goes sufficiently down enough for the LED to glow. The potentiometer connected in the circuit is also for the same reason. Now, by the basic knowledge of electronics, you could easily say that upon changing the pot value the ADC value changes. Thus, for various reasons (like poor lighting conditions, you are unable to distinguish between bright and dark conditions, etc), you can vary the pot to get desired results. This is why I have given the two thresholds (RTHRES anf LTHRES) in the beginning of the code. So, this is all with the ADC. I hope you enjoyed reading this.

You’re setting the ADMUX and ADCSRA wrong. Also PORTB is 8bit and ADC is 16bit register. So there are two ways to do it. First is to set ADLAR=1 (in ADMUX) and read from ADCH (PORTB = ADCH;). Or the second option is to right shift ADC register by 2 and then store the result in PORTB (ADC = ADC &gt;&gt; 2; PORTB = ADCL;) Reply thrishool April 10, 2016 Hey how yo write that code in programmet note pad using c Reply Max May 4, 2016 Sorry what?

You're most likely used to using the preprocessor to include files directly into other files, or #define constants, but the preprocessor can also be used to create &quot;inlined&quot; code using macros expanded at compile time and to prevent code from being compiled twice. There are essentially three uses of the preprocessor--directives, constants, and macros. Directives are commands that tell the preprocessor to skip part of a file, include another file, or define a constant or macro. Directives always begin with a sharp sign (#) and for readability should be placed flush to the left of the page. All other uses of the preprocessor involve processing #define'd constants or macros. Typically, constants and macros are written in ALL CAPS to indicate they are special (as we will see). Header Files The #include directive tells the preprocessor to grab the text of a file and place it directly into the current file. Typically, such statements are placed at the top of a program--hence the name &quot;header file&quot; for files thus included. Constants If we write #define [identifier name] [value] whenever [identifier name] shows up in the file, it will be replaced by [value]. If you are defining a constant in terms of a mathematical expression, it is wise to surround the entire value in parentheses: #define PI_PLUS_ONE (3.14 + 1) By doing so, you avoid the possibility that an order of operations issue will destroy the meaning of your constant: x = PI_PLUS_ONE * 5; Without parentheses, the above would be converted to x = 3.14 + 1 * 5; which would result in 1 * 5 being evaluated before the addition, not after. Oops! It is also possible to write simply #define [identifier name] which defines [identifier name] without giving it a value. This can be useful in conjunction with another set of directives that allow conditional compilation. Conditional Compilation There are a whole set of options that can be used to determine whether the preprocessor will remove lines of code before handing the file to the compiler. They include #if, #elif, #else, #ifdef, and #ifndef. An #if or #if/#elif/#else block or a #ifdef or #ifndef block must be terminated with a closing #endif. The #if directive takes a numerical argument that evaluates to true if it's non-zero. If its argument is false, then code until the closing #else, #elif, of #endif will be excluded. Commenting out Code Conditional compilation is a particularly useful way to comment out a block of code that contains multi-line comments (which cannot be nested). #if 0 /* comment ... */ // code /* comment */ #endif Include Guards Another common problem is that a header file is required in multiple other header files that are later included into a source code file, with the result often being that variables, structs, classes or functions appear to be defined multiple times (once for each time the header file is included). This can result in a lot of compile-time headaches. Fortunately, the preprocessor provides an easy technique for ensuring that any given file is included once and only once. By using the #ifndef directive, you can include a block of text only if a particular expression is undefined; then, within the header file, you can define the expression. This ensures that the code in the #ifndef is included only the first time the file is loaded. #ifndef _FILE_NAME_H_ #define _FILE_NAME_H_ /* code */ #endif // #ifndef _FILE_NAME_H_ Notice that it's not necessary to actually give a value to the expression _FILE_NAME_H_. It's sufficient to include the line &quot;#define _FILE_NAME_H_&quot; to make it &quot;defined&quot;. (Note that there is an n in #ifndef--it stands for &quot;if not defined&quot;). A similar tactic can be used for defining specific constants, such as NULL: #ifndef NULL #define NULL (void *)0 #endif // #ifndef NULL Notice that it's useful to comment which conditional statement a particular #endif terminates. This is particularly true because preprocessor directives are rarely indented, so it can be hard to follow the flow of execution. On many compilers, the #pragma once directive can be used intead of include guards. Macros The other major use of the preprocessor is to define macros. The advantage of a macro is that it can be type-neutral (this can also be a disadvantage, of course), and it's inlined directly into the code, so there isn't any function call overhead. (Note that in C++, it's possible to get around both of these issues with templated functions and the inline keyword.) A macro definition is usually of the following form: #define MACRO_NAME(arg1, arg2, ...) [code to expand to] For instance, a simple increment macro might look like this: #define INCREMENT(x) x++ They look a lot like function calls, but they're not so simple. There are actually a couple of tricky points when it comes to working with macros. First, remember that the exact text of the macro argument is &quot;pasted in&quot; to the macro. For instance, if you wrote something like this: #define MULT(x, y) x * y and then wrote int z = MULT(3 + 2, 4 + 2); what value do you expect z to end up with? The obvious answer, 30, is wrong! That's because what happens when the macro MULT expands is that it looks like this: int z = 3 + 2 * 4 + 2; // 2 * 4 will be evaluated first! So z would end up with the value 13! This is almost certainly not what you want to happen. The way to avoid it is to force the arguments themselves to be evaluated before the rest of the macro body. You can do this by surrounding them by parentheses in the macro definition: #define MULT(x, y) (x) * (y) // now MULT(3 + 2, 4 + 2) will expand to (3 + 2) * (4 + 2) But this isn't the only gotcha! It is also generally a good idea to surround the macro's code in parentheses if you expect it to return a value. Otherwise, you can get similar problems as when you define a constant. For instance, the following macro, which adds 5 to a given argument, has problems when embedded within a larger statement: #define ADD_FIVE(a) (a) + 5 int x = ADD_FIVE(3) * 3; // this expands to (3) + 5 * 3, so 5 * 3 is evaluated first // Now x is 18, not 24! To fix this, you generally want to surround the whole macro body with parentheses to prevent the surrounding context from affecting the macro body. #define ADD_FIVE(a) ((a) + 5) int x = ADD_FIVE(3) * 3; On the other hand, if you have a multiline macro that you are using for its side effects, rather than to compute a value, you probably want to wrap it within curly braces so you don't have problems when using it following an if statement. // We use a trick involving exclusive-or to swap two variables #define SWAP(a, b) a ^= b; b ^= a; a ^= b; int x = 10; int y = 5; // works OK SWAP(x, y); // What happens now? if(x &lt; 0) SWAP(x, y); When SWAP is expanded in the second example, only the first statement, a ^= b, is governed by the conditional; the other two statements will always execute. What we really meant was that all of the statements should be grouped together, which we can enforce using curly braces: #define SWAP(a, b) {a ^= b; b ^= a; a ^= b;} Now, there is still a bit more to our story! What if you write code like so: #define SWAP(a, b) { a ^= b; b ^= a; a ^= b; } int x = 10; int y = 5; int z = 4; // What happens now? if(x &lt; 0) SWAP(x, y); else SWAP(x, z); Then it will not compile because semicolon after the closing curly brace will break the flow between if and else. The solution? Use a do-while loop: #define SWAP(a, b) do { a ^= b; b ^= a; a ^= b; } while ( 0 ) int x = 10; int y = 5; int z = 4; // What happens now? if(x &lt; 0) SWAP(x, y); else SWAP(x, z); Now the semi-colon doesn't break anything because it is part of the expression. (By the way, note that we didn't surround the arguments in parentheses because we don't expect anyone to pass an expression into swap!) More Gotchas By now, you've probably realized why people don't really like using macros. They're dangerous, they're picky, and they're just not that safe. Perhaps the most irritating problem with macros is that you don't want to pass arguments with &quot;side effects&quot; to macros. By side effects, I mean any expression that does something besides evaluate to a value. For instance, ++x evaluates to x+1, but it also increments x. This increment operation is a side effect. The problem with side effects is that macros don't evaluate their arguments; they just paste them into the macro text when performing the substitution. So something like #define MAX(a, b) ((a) &lt; (b) ? (b) : (a)) int x = 5, y = 10; int z = MAX(x++, y++); will end up looking like this: int z = (x++ &lt; y++ ? y++ : x++) The problem here is that y++ ends up being evaluated twice! The nasty consequence is that after this expression, y will have a value of 12 rather than the expected 11. This can be a real pain to debug! Multiline macros Until now, we've seen only short, one line macros (possibly taking advantage of the semicolon to put multiple statements on one line.) It turns out that by using a the &quot;\&quot; to indicate a line continuation, we can write our macros across multiple lines to make them a bit more readable. For instance, we could rewrite swap as #define SWAP(a, b) { \ a ^= b; \ b ^= a; \ a ^= b; \ } Notice that you do not need a slash at the end of the last line! The slash tells the preprocessor that the macro continues to the next line, not that the line is a continuation from a previous line. Aside from readability, writing multi-line macros may make it more obvious that you need to use curly braces to surround the body because it's more clear that multiple effects are happening at once. Advanced Macro Tricks In addition to simple substitution, the preprocessor can also perform a bit of extra work on macro arguments, such as turning them into strings or pasting them together. Pasting Tokens Each argument passed to a macro is a token, and sometimes it might be expedient to paste arguments together to form a new token. This could come in handy if you have a complicated structure and you'd like to debug your program by printing out different fields. Instead of writing out the whole structure each time, you might use a macro to pass in the field of the structure to print. To paste tokens in a macro, use ## between the two things to paste together. For instance #define BUILD_FIELD(field) my_struct.inner_struct.union_a.##field Now, when used with a particular field name, it will expand to something like my_struct.inner_struct.union_a.field1 The tokens are literally pasted together. String-izing Tokens Another potentially useful macro option is to turn a token into a string containing the literal text of the token. This might be useful for printing out the token. The syntax is simple--simply prefix the token with a pound sign (#). #define PRINT_TOKEN(token) printf(#token &quot; is %d&quot;, token) For instance, PRINT_TOKEN(foo) would expand to printf(&quot;&lt;foo&gt;&quot; &quot; is %d&quot; &lt;foo&gt;) (Note that in C, string literals next to each other are concatenated, so something like &quot;token&quot; &quot; is &quot; &quot; this &quot; will effectively become &quot;token is this&quot;. This can be useful for formatting printf statements.) For instance, you might use it to print the value of an expression as well as the expression itself (for debugging purposes). PRINT_TOKEN(x + y); Avoiding Macros in C++ In C++, you should generally avoid macros when possible. You won't be able to avoid them entirely if you need the ability to paste tokens together, but with templated classes and type inference for templated functions, you shouldn't need to use macros to create type-neutral code. Inline functions should also get rid of the need for macros for efficiency reasons. (Though you aren't guaranteed that the compiler will inline your code.) Moreover, you should use const to declare typed constants rather than #define to create untyped (and therefore less safe) constants. Const should work in pretty much all contexts where you would want to use a #define, including declaring static sized arrays or as template parameters.

Week 5 Learn, Teach or Do Calligraphy in Luton Hints and Tips ← A Calligraphy Workshop at Jewels. Blowing my own trumpet. → Getting Started in Calligraphy Posted on October 26, 2011 | 11 Comments Calligraphy. Getting started. The Scribe's nightmare. The Scribe’s Nightmare. I strongly suggest that beginners read this post first and then click on Lesson One. Familiarise yourself first with the Roundhand alphabet. I am sure it will save a lot of heartache later. Firstly, there are so many products on sale, all purported to be the must have for the budding scribe. For the time being, my advice is to forget all that. Keep it simple. Buy or make only that which you need to get through the next stage in your journey. All the pens and brushes in the whole wide world are of no use if you have no idea what to do with them. If you follow the Calligradoodles videos and use the worksheets that go with them, you will notice that all the elements are made up of pencil marks on paper. So, all we need to get started, is a sheet of ordinary copy paper, a ruler and two pencils joined together with elastic bands. ( Better than tape when it comes to sharpening ). A board of some description propped at an angle of about 20 degrees on your table, or even on your knees ( Not good for the back! ), will be enough for the first few sessions. So, now you are able to construct a half decent Roundhand and Roman alphabet and are ready to progress. You will need a pen and some ink, and once again there are so many products out there that confusion can easily set in, so simplicity is best. A fountain pen set with 4 – 6 nib sizes and a good supply of cartridges or ink is a good addition to your tool-box at this point. A couple of pen holders and some broad nibs plus a bottle of black calligraphy ink ( not waterproof, this will easily clog your nib ). Here I shall make no apologies for directing you to Bill’s Art and Calligraphy Supplies I do earn a small commission from Amazon on any sales, But please don’t feel that you have to buy here. The main reason for setting up this A Shop was to illustrate the mind boggling choices we have just in this one discipline. The Book Section is mind blowing! If I can raise a few pennies to offset expenses, thanks for your custom. The Technik Art Layout Pad A/3 is a handy addition right now. Only 50 gsm means you can make one guideline sheet and lay it under each page. A good tip at this point is to rule lines at 1/8″intervals from top to bottom of that page. If you do this in landscape format it will be much more versatile. When laid under the actual working page it is easy to mark an X over 1,2,3, or however many lines it takes to make up the x height needed for the particular nib size you are using. This will stand you in good stead for the rest of your life. If you do have to draw lines, always draw them in multiples of 1/8″ according to nib size. More on this as you progress. The Brause assortment calligraphy set or William Mitchell right hand italic set. ( There are left hand versions available, and you will find a really good book for Lefthanders in the book department ). ( See also The Left-handed Calligrapher, here at Bill’s Space, and for more support and info try the Facebook group, Calligraphy for the Left Handed ) . The Manuscript Leonardt Calligraphy dip pen nibs – Italic and Poster set, is particularly good value. A bottle of black Manuscript ink or set of three, black, gold, red, W &amp; N inks will keep you busy for a while. A better quality paper is now needed to show off your new skills so a pad of Daler Rowney A/3 might be your next choice. Why A/3? Simply, this size gives more scope for layouts. If you need a smaller format, it is no problem to cut a page. For line drawing, a Rowney or any of the many boards or drawing machines available will make life a bit easier, but I find a set square running along a 2 foot ruler taped to my board is quite sufficient. Incidentally, I use a home made light -table whenever possible. If you try this, PLEASE USE ONLY TOUGHENED GLASS.There is a commercially made Artograph box in Bill’s Art and calligraphy supplies. A “T”-square is a handy addition and perhaps a few basic drawing instruments next. You see. Your collection is building up already. But only with stuff you use. Not just stuff! Scribblers have kindly issued 50 calligraphy tips You might find these useful. By the way, when conducting a workshop, I usually ask participants to bring with them the following articles if at all possible. A drawing board, approximately 18” x 24”. MDF or something similar will do, Something to prop it up to make a writing slope, i.e., a piece of wood 4” x 4” or perhaps a brick wrapped in a carrier bag. A ruler , preferably 2 foot, and a set square. A set of roundhand nibs with penholder and reservoirs. A calligraphy fountain pen is a handy addition for practice work. (Any left-handers will benefit by choosing left hand oblique nibs). Calligraphy ink. NOT WATERPROOF. Avoid Indian ink whether waterproof or not. Gouache or watercolours. Coeruleum Blue, and Vermilion. Winsor &amp; Newton Gold ink. (Optional but very handy.) 2, HB and I, 2H pencil. A 00 paint brush. A cheap brush for mixing. A palette or saucer. A jar for water and a kitchen roll. An A3 Layout pad or even a cheap sketch book. If you have some, a nice HP watercolour paper for your finished work If you have problems obtaining any commercially marketed equipment, You might try going back to basics and making your own. It is a good idea anyway to experiment with quills, reeds, bamboo, tin cans etc. My take on the Cola pen. The RED STRIPE Pen. To my mind, much more fun emptying the can. A chisel cut pencil to dip. A needlepoint and 6mm with film reservoir. Bamboo, and a 2mm Reed. Make sure mummy and daddy are supervising. Heheh. We don’t want any cut fingers! With scissors, cut top and bottom from the can, making sure you have first downed the contents. (Adults, it might be best to leave this stage ’til tomorrow, depending on the strength of the aforesaid). Carefully, (The cut tin can will be very sharp). Open up and then fold down the length of the metal. Cut whatever shape you are looking for for the nib…then continue down the length,making sure to leave enough for the handle. This is rolled and then taped tightly. Perhaps strengthening by rolling the handle round a pencil. You could make a much prettier job by soldering.Just make sure that all bare edges are covered or blunted. ‘speriment and enjoy. You might like to note that I have been experimenting with various materials to use as reservoirs. The best so far is old fashioned film or even negatives. Used flat it can be cut and pushed into a slit formed in the quill, reed, bamboo or whatever, or rolled into a spring and pushed into the aperture.

I have been a calligrapher for about 35 years (and calligraphic engraver for nine) and was approached to teach a brief class this summer to elementary students. Each class is about 45 minutes long and I’ve been told they want a demonstration followed by time for the kids to practice. Do you have any brilliant ideas? I’ve taught adults before but my challenge this time is that many of these kids have not yet mastered their OWN handwriting skills! Thank you for any light you can shed on this situation!

I also have been asked to do something similar for a local Guide / Brownie group but have decided that 45 minutes is just not long enough to do justice to the subject. OK if you are going to have follow up sessions but not a one off. Here is one with 15 / 16 year olds that took twice as long and was still a bit of a rush. https://calligraphybybillgrant.com/2014/05/19/a-calligraphy-workshop-at-the-red-dot-gallery/ For youngsters it might be an idea to draw out a large banner on lining paper then ask them to put on some colour.

Wvdial is mainly used to configure the dialup settings. For setting up various settings for PPP connection and establishing a data connection on these capes follow the link to the wiki Way to setup the Vayu 2G Capes How to read location and coarse time as NMEA-0183 message from the serial UART ttyO4 port How to write wvdial conf files for any network Sample wvdial.conf file for AT&amp;T and T-Mobile USA For using the Vayu-3G-A/Vayu-3GP-A Cape, please ensure that you have the following : USB drivers for the modem (21f5:2012) installed in kernel PPS drivers enabled in kernel, required if GPS module is present. VAYU Device tree overlay file is properly configured. You can either download kernel patches containing the same to use with your existing images or you can download our prebuilt MicroSD card image or EMMC flasher image. All the images and files and extra support on software can be found here: Vayu_Cape_SW_images_and_drivers Note : On most beaglebones, there is a known bug with USB hotplug for using USB HUB with Beaglebone black host port. So to efficiently be able to use the modem, follow the Power on Modem section properly. An alternative easier approach is to keep the second host port on cape populated with a usb device. Hardware Configurations The 3G/WCDMA modem has following interfaces available on the Cape: Leaflet_3G modem Mini USB B Device port on Cape (P9): It has to be connected to USB host port on Beaglebone Black. SMA connector for GSM/WCDMA antenna(P7): Antenna is connected here. LED D2 (5V Power LED of Cape) : This LED indicates that the Cape is powered on with 5V and GSM/WCDMA modem is also powered. LED D4 (SIGNAL LED) : This LED is the SIGNAL LED for the GSM/WCDMA modem whose various blinking states denote the different states of the WCDMA Modem. GPIO45 (ON/OFF PIN) : It is the GPIO connected to Power ON/OFF pin of GSM/WCDMA Modem. GPIO60 (Hard Reset Pin) : It is the GPIO connected to Reset pin of GSM/WCDMA Modem. S1 (ON/OFF switch) : This push button switch is connected to Power ON/OFF pin of GSM/WCDMA modem. S2 (RESET switch) : This push button switch is connected to Hard Reset pin of GSM/WCDMA modem. GPIO45 and GPIO60 should be set high at all instances for the GSM/WCDMA modem to be available for use. USB drivers for the modem (21f5:2012, 21f5:2009) should be included in the kernel. We provide pre-compiled images with USB drivers included in the kernel. Getting started Seting up the system Sim Card and Antennae 1. Place a mini sim in the sim card slot and connect a GSM antenna to the SMA connector. 2. Mount the cape on BBB carefully. 3. Connect the extra usb cable provided with the cape between Host port on Beaglebone Black and miniUSB device port on Cape. 4. To avoid the bug on Beaglebone black with external USB hubs, please connect a USB device (pendrive etc) to extra host port on the cape. 5. Ensuring that the power jumper on the cape is in its place, power up the setup using a 5V DC adapter(min 2.5A) to barrel jack. D2 LED on the cape will glow alongwith LEDs on the Beaglebone black. Note : Before proceeding further ensure D2 LED is glowing properly. Make sure that the adapter being used is of proper rating and has been connected properly. Further check for the presence of the power jumper(#12 on leaflet). Note : Do not try to power up using USB cable alone. Always power up system with a DC adapter. Also while disconnecting power, USB cable should be removed before the DC adapter. Hardware setup Check.jpg Usb.jpg Final.jpg USB ports and power jumper on the cape USB connections on cape and beaglebone black Final setup before login Ways to log into the cape After establishing that the power on the cape is proper, log in to the BBB plus cape setup using any of the following method : 1. Through USB client. 2. Through Ethernet cable. Now login by using the SSH command. Make sure to login as root only so that all the special priviledges are available. 1. Through USB client. Use the command : ssh -l root 192.168.7.2 to login onto the system. Default password is root. 2. Through ethernet cable. The ip address of the ethernet cable should be known. Use that with the ssh command to esatblish a connection : ssh -l root $address Default Username and password is root. In Yantrr Precompiled images, IP address is 192.168.1.150 After logging into the BBB plus cape system, export and set the GPIO45 and GPIO60 high by using: cd /sys/class/gpio/ echo 45 &gt; export echo 60 &gt; export cd gpio45 echo “high” &gt; direction cd .. cd gpio60 echo “high” &gt; direction NOTE : In precompiled image, for ease of use these regular commands for use with the GPIOs have been created as functions : pinexp, setout, setin, pinread. pinexp 45 pinexp 60 setout 45 high setout 60 high Power On Modem The Modem can be powered on by providing a low level pulse at ON/OFF Pin for 3-4s when the module is off. It can be achieved by either using the push button switch S1 or GPIO45. cd /sys/class/gpio/ echo 45 &gt; export cd gpio45 echo &quot;high&quot; &gt; direction sleep 4 echo &quot;low&quot; &gt; direction sleep 4 echo &quot;high&quot; &gt; direction After some time, LED D4 should start blinking as to indicate modem has turned on. (Note : In some of 3G modules LED functionality is not enabled by the manufacturer, so the LED D4 might not blink) Note : In cases where a usb device was not connected to extra host port on cape, please connect the provided USB cable after turning on the modem. Check that modem is visible on the USB bus by: lsusb Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0424:2412 Standard Microsystems Corp.

The generic driver is not reliable. Note : If the modem is not visible after these steps or any issues are faced while initializing the modem please contact Yantrr Support (support@yantrr.com) with the above log messages (dmesg | grep –I usb or /var/log/syslog). Understanding the TTYUSB ports on BBB capes Vayu 3G cape enumerate 3 different usb ports /dev/ttyUSB0 /dev/ttyUSB1 /dev/ttyUSB2 ttyUSB0 is data port &amp; command for modem, use this for the WVDIAL conf or PPP ttyUSB1 is the diag port for the Firmware upgrade ttyUSB2 is the AT CMD port only. Note : These ttyUSB ports are only created if proper drivers are present or when “modprobe usbserial” command is issued. Pre compiled images with drivers are available on the Yantrr wiki page. Note : Both ttyUSB0 and ttyUSB2 take the AT commands, but ttyUSB0 port is also a Data communications port so for all intended purposes of issuing AT commands use ttyUSB2 port(PCUI port). Power Off Modem The modem can be powered off by providing a low level pulse at ON/OFF pin for 3-4s when the module is On. It can be achieved by either using the push button switch S1 or GPIO45. cd /sys/class/gpio/ echo 45 &gt; export cd gpio45 echo &quot;high&quot; &gt; direction sleep 4 echo &quot;low&quot; &gt; direction sleep 4 echo &quot;high&quot; &gt; direction Modem can also be turned off by issuing following AT commands on port /dev/ttyUSB2 AT+ZPWROFF Soft Resetting the Modem Steps - Power Off the Modem. Wait for 1-2s atleast. Power on the modem. Hard resetting the modem There might arise situations where modem does not seem to be responding to any commands issued on AT commands port or it cannot be turned on/off. In such scenarios, issue hard reset to the modem. It can be done by either toggling Switch S2 for atleast 100ms or pulling GPIO60 low for 1s and then setting it high again. cd /sys/class/gpio/ cd gpio60 echo &quot;low&quot; &gt; direction sleep 1 echo &quot;high&quot; &gt; direction Note : Please use hard reset conservatively. Soft reset should be preferred under most conditions. VAYU 3GHx-D(ZTE Modem) VAYU 3GHx-D capes have ZTE MG3732 modem. Their functionality is essentially the same with some minor changes. For more information on ZTE MG3732 modem and a quick reference guide click here AT Commands Manual The AT Command for the 3G Module can be downloaded from here : WCDMA AT Commands Manual FAQ FAQ for this section click here Data connection procedure using PPP Notes All commands are recommended to executed as root user. USB drivers need to be installed in the kernel for the WCDMA modem to work. Modem port for Vayu cape is ttyUSB0, use this port for PPPd or Wvdial AT Commands port for Vayu cape is ttyUSB2 Wvdial Configuration for Debian Wheezy Download and install Wvdial apt-get install wvdial Executing the following command usually sets the wvdial.conf file which is used for dialing to GPRS communication, but since here our modem port is on a UART(/dev/ttyO1) and not on /dev/ttyS* or /dev/ttyUSB* ports, we will have to manually configure it. So, open the wvdial.conf file $ nano /etc/wvdial.conf Assuming that you have the USERNAME, PASSWORD and APN available for the service provider of the sim card being used, edit and make wvdial.conf file like this. Sample wvdial.conf file for AT&amp;T and T-Mobile USA [Dialer Defaults] Modem Type = Analog ModemPhone = *99# ISDN = 0 Baud = 115200 Username = USERNAME Password = PASSWORD Modem = /dev/ttyUSB0 Init1 = ATZ Init2 = ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &amp;C1 &amp;D2 +FCLASS=0 Init3 = at+cgdcont=1,&quot;ip&quot;,&quot;APN&quot; Stupid Mode = 1 Usually for GSM Networks, Modemphone is *99# or *99***1#. Consult your network provider for exact details in case you are facing difficulties. After editing, save and exit, now run wvdial for establishing communication. $ wvdial If all parameters are correct and everything is working, you should see a success message from wvdial. Once PPP connection has been established, you will see a ppp0 IP. To check the status of wvdial and find out its IP open a new shell and use either of following: Run ifconfig and find ppp0 in the list of network connections. $ ifconfig or $ ifconfig ppp0 Check the network statistics for IP and their gateways and check the Iface column for ppp0 $ netstat -arn * Kernel IP routing table Destination Gateway Genmask Flags MSS Window irtt Iface 0.0.0.0 192.168.1.1 0.0.0.0 UG 0 0 0 eth0 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 U 0 0 0 eth0 192.168.7.0 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.252 U 0 0 0 usb0 192.200.1.21 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 UH 0 0 0 ppp0 Read the system messages as $ cat /var/log/messages It lists all the attempts at establishing ppp communication using the modem and IPs for the successful attempt. Now all that is left is to route the network traffic over the gateway of ppp0 instead of eth0 so that GPRS communication is fully completed. PPP connection has been established over GPRS using 2G/3G module and wvdial. System Status After PPP has been established, the following is the status of the LEDs and GPIOs (For verification) STATUS LED D3 – It is continuously glowing, once the Modem was turned on. SIGNAL LED D4 – It is now blinking at 64ms ON/300ms OFF . Earlier when PPP was not established but SIMcard was detected by modem, then it was blinking at 64ms ON/3000ms OFF. ON/OFF GPIO45 – Its value should be 1. RESET GPIO60 – Its value should always be 1.

Using GPS module with Debian Wheezy Please refer to Software startup Guide for VAYU GPS FAQ FAQ 1: Modem / TTYUSB of modem not detected Solution 1. Remove the power cord from the board and reconnect it while the USB cable is not connected to the cape. Then you should follow the procedure to turn on the 3G module as follows set GPIO 45 to high in output mode Then after 3-4s , either press the switch S1 for 4s and then release it or instead of switch you can also recycle the value of GPIO 45 to low then high at intervals of 4s and now connect the USB cable. ** Always make sure GPIO 45 is in HIGH state ** cd /sys/class/gpio/ echo 45 &gt; export cd gpio45 echo &quot;high&quot; &gt; direction sleep 4 **Now enable the modem by toggling GPIO 45 *** echo &quot;low&quot; &gt; direction sleep 4 echo &quot;high&quot; &gt; direction sleep 4 ** To disable the Modem, again toggle GPIO45 ** echo &quot;low&quot; &gt; direction sleep 4 echo &quot;high&quot; &gt; direction sleep 4 Solution 2. Due to hotplug issue in AM335x we can do a workaround, connect a usb device like a pendrive on second host port on cape and then just press the switch S1 for 4s after setting GPIO45 high. This will most certainly work. Solution 3. This solution resets the usbcore of the AM335x and reinitialize it. This has been identified as a last resort workaround, NOTE, this will reset all peripheral on that USB CORE If the Device is disconnecting as soon as you try to establish connection even when you are sure that 3G module is on, then following should be followed : reset the USB1 echo 0 &gt; /sys/bus/usb/devices/usb1/bConfigurationValue echo 1 &gt; /sys/bus/usb/devices/usb1/bConfigurationValue Retrieved from &quot;http://www.yantrr.com/w/index.php?title=SW_startup_guide_for_Vayu_3G&amp;oldid=669&quot; Personal tools Log in Namespaces Page Discussion Variants Views Read View source View history Actions Search Navigation Main page Recent changes Random page Yantrr Links BeagleBone M2M Cape Order Capes Tools What links here Related changes Special pages Printable version Permanent link This page was last modified on 21 July 2015, at 11:17.

                   NS1:content=" Marco Marchini computer engineer, developer, maker LinkedIn GitHub Twitter Facebook Instagram Email 13 Nov 2014 • on beaglebone black, GSM Click profile image for Marco Marchini by Marco Marchini Using the Mikroelektronika GSM Click on the BeagleBone Black I recently came across the problem of connecting a BeagleBone Black to the Internet using a GSM/GPRS connection, so that the applications on the board could access a remote service without the need for a cabled or wifi network. After some research, I found a pretty good solution: the GSM Click from Mikroelektronika. This add-on board is one of a series of boards associated by the use of the so called Mikrobus interface. The GSM Click mounts a Telit GL865-QUAD GSM/GPRS module, which supports GSM/GPRS 850/900/1800/ 1900 MHz Quad-band frequency. Wiring The GSM Click can use a 3.3V power supply and communicates through a simple serial interface. Therefore, connecting it to the BeagleBone Black was pretty straightforward: BeagleBone Black GSM Click P9_04 (DC_3.3V) 3.3V P9_02 (GND) GND P9_21 (UART2_TXD) RX P9_22 (UART2_RXD) TX As you can see, I used the UART2 port on the BeagleBone Black. This is because I've noticed that using UART1 for the GSM Click creates problems if there's a USB device plugged into the board (as in my case). Otherwise, if no USB device is attached, UART1 works perfectly. Actyally, it seems there are problems with the GSM Click whenever we have another serial device attached. In fact, there are problems also when the UART0 (debug) is attached to my laptop. &lt;--- VERIFY THIS! Using the UARTs with the Adafruit BBIO Python library GPIO handling is greatly simplified on the BeagleBone Black, thanks to the awesome job done by Adafruit with its Adafruit BBIO Python library. First thing, download and install the library (complete guide at the link provided above) and some other prerequisites: sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-pip -y sudo pip install Adafruit_BBIO sudo pip install pyserial then execute this simple Python script to test out that everything works correctly: import Adafruit_BBIO.UART as UART import serial UART.setup(&quot;UART2&quot;) sp = serial.Serial(port = '/dev/ttyO2', baudrate=9600) sp.close() sp.open() if sp.isOpen(): print &quot;Serial port is open!&quot; sp.write(&quot;hello&quot;) sp.close() Testing serial communication with minicom Installing minicom is useful to test serial ports and to interact with serial devices: sudo apt-get install minicom If you are using UART2 for the GSM module, you can launch: minicom -b 9600 -D /dev/ttyO2 and then write the command &quot;AT&quot; (without quotes) followed by carriage return. If you get the response &quot;OK&quot;, your module is good to go. Sakis3g and ppp Next step: installing sakis3g. This utility handles Internet connections through UMTS USB devices. For some reason sakis3g's website (sakis3g.org) has been down for a while, but it's possible to download the software from download mirrors, like this one. sudo apt-get install ppp The initialization script tinit.py Connecting Disconnecting References Adafruit BBIO and UARTs Sakis3g download mirror Marco Marchini © 2014.

                   NS1:content=" The Geek Stuff ≡ Menu Home Free eBook Start Here Contact About 7 Chmod Command Examples for Beginners by SathiyaMoorthy on June 8, 2010 Earlier we discussed about how to use octal permission bits with chmod. In this article, let us review how to use symbolic representation with chmod. Following are the symbolic representation of three different roles: u is for user, g is for group, and o is for others. Following are the symbolic representation of three different permissions: r is for read permission, w is for write permission, x is for execute permission. Following are few examples on how to use the symbolic representation on chmod. 1. Add single permission to a file/directory Changing permission to a single set. + symbol means adding permission. For example, do the following to give execute permission for the user irrespective of anything else: $ chmod u+x filename 2. Add multiple permission to a file/directory Use comma to separate the multiple permission sets as shown below. $ chmod u+r,g+x filename 3. Remove permission from a file/directory Following example removes read and write permission for the user. $ chmod u-rx filename 4. Change permission for all roles on a file/directory Following example assigns execute privilege to user, group and others (basically anybody can execute this file). $ chmod a+x filename 5. Make permission for a file same as another file (using reference) If you want to change a file permission same as another file, use the reference option as shown below. In this example, file2’s permission will be set exactly same as file1’s permission. $ chmod --reference=file1 file2 6. Apply the permission to all the files under a directory recursively Use option -R to change the permission recursively as shown below. $ chmod -R 755 directory-name/ 7. Change execute permission only on the directories (files are not affected) On a particular directory if you have multiple sub-directories and files, the following command will assign execute permission only to all the sub-directories in the current directory (not the files in the current directory). $ chmod u+X * Note: If the files has execute permission already for either the group or others, the above command will assign the execute permission to the user &gt; Add your comment If you enjoyed this article, you might also like.. 50 Linux Sysadmin Tutorials 50 Most Frequently Used Linux Commands (With Examples) Top 25 Best Linux Performance Monitoring and Debugging Tools Mommy, I found it! – 15 Practical Linux Find Command Examples Linux 101 Hacks 2nd Edition eBook Linux 101 Hacks Book Awk Introduction – 7 Awk Print Examples Advanced Sed Substitution Examples 8 Essential Vim Editor Navigation Fundamentals 25 Most Frequently Used Linux IPTables Rules Examples Turbocharge PuTTY with 12 Powerful Add-Ons Bash 101 Hacks Book Sed and Awk 101 Hacks Book Nagios Core 3 Book Vim 101 Hacks Book Tagged as: Chmod Command, Chmod Examples, Linux Chmod Examples, Unix Chmod Examples { 23 comments… add one } Egor June 8, 2010, 3:32 am I think correct command for the p.3 in accordance with its subject should be $ chmod u-rw filename, don’t I? Link nardi June 8, 2010, 5:59 am The last one is most handy! Can’t even remember, how many times I tried to remove exec permision from files copyed from M$ systems but not affect directories. former solution: for f in `ls -R` ; do [ ! -d “$f” ] &amp;&amp; chmod a-x “$f” ; done and now: chmod -R a-x,u+X * big thx Link rbz June 8, 2010, 7:20 am @nardi: While the first six examples are rather trivial I agree for the last one. I’ve been looking for this solution for months. chmod -R a-x,u+X * – such a beauty! thx Link Alex June 12, 2010, 12:51 am The last one is truly great. I’ve always used “find -type d -exec …” for this. I’m a little confused about your note, though. Why would it care about the group permissions? Link nardi June 13, 2010, 1:26 pm @Alex The note is about regular files, that the +X rule is not only affecting directories. See man chmod or try it yourself by hand. This will set the exec rights: nardi@kub1x ~/test $ ll file -rw-r-xr– 1 nardi nardi 56 Jun 13 21:06 file* nardi@kub1x ~/test $ chmod a+X file nardi@kub1x ~/test $ ll file -rwxr-xr-x 1 nardi nardi 56 Jun 13 21:06 file* This won’t set anything, because regular file “file” is neither a directory nor has any exec bit on. nardi@kub1x ~/test $ ll file -rw-r–r– 1 nardi nardi 56 Jun 13 21:06 file nardi@kub1x ~/test $ chmod u+X file nardi@kub1x ~/test $ ll file -rw-r–r– 1 nardi nardi 56 Jun 13 21:06 file Link john August 30, 2011, 7:32 am chmod -R a-x,u+X * this command applyed my vstfd stop please give solution Link Claudia February 22, 2012, 5:11 am I used to work with linux command in the University and after a pause of few years… it brought me back to ‘beginers mode’ when I needed to use chmod.

Link julijuli October 29, 2013, 9:42 am thats good Link Varun Jain December 4, 2013, 10:11 pm The beauty of Linux file security is chmod. It allow all user to different permission. Simply: Read: 4 Write: 2 Execute: 1 First character for : User Second for : Group and Third for : All For example User wants to only read file only for user then: chmod 400 easy job!! Love File Permission Link Mitch December 23, 2013, 12:15 pm Yes, simple binary. RWX 4,2,1. Any combination for owner, group, all. Here are some very common chmod examples. 755 – Can’t execute without read. So owner gets all rights and all others can execute and read. 644 – Non-executable file that the owner can write to and all others can read. 666 Read/Write by all, inherently evil.

This specifies the filesystem type of the filesystem to be mounted. In your case, this would be /dev/sdb2. Some common, valid filesystem types are: auto - this is a special one. It will try to guess the fs type when you use this. ext4 - this is probably the most common Linux fs type of the last few years ext3 - this is the most common Linux fs type from a couple years back ntfs - this is the most common Windows fs type or larger external hard drives vfat - this is the most common fs type used for smaller external hard drives share|edit answered May 29 '12 at 15:01 reverendj1 8,6192534 6 But normally, it will guess the correct filesystem. I don't think I usually need to specify the file system type. There may be some other problem preventing it from recognizing the type in this case. – Marty Fried May 29 '12 at 16:25 Given that the OP seems to be trying to fix a damaged filesystem, it may not be detected correctly. – reverendj1 May 29 '12 at 16:44 I only see a damaged grub configuration, with a UUID that doesn't exist; but what I was gettting at is to suggest that this may not be the problem (not so much for you as for the OP). The problem may well be something like an incorrect partition specifier, but I didn't want to get too detailed because his question was not well done (note he didn't even specify the mount command at all), plus he's already started other topics on the subject, it seems.

Usually if you mount a partition with a common filesystem type using mount, it will auto-detect the partition type. The fact that it isn't auto-detecting it in this case could signal a few possibilities. You haven't installed filesystem tools for the chosen filesystem. If you did a standard desktop install of Ubuntu, this shouldn't normally be a problem. For example, to mount ntfs drives in recent versions of Ubuntu you need the ntfs-3g package. You selected the wrong partition. The partition is corrupt or unformatted. In this case, you should probably do a filesystem check (fsck) on it before mounting it. You may then want to proceed to mount it manually, specifying the filesystem type, as read-only. If all else fails you may need special recovery software such as testdisk photorec. share|edit edited Jun 30 '15 at 23:59 answered Jul 23 '13 at 1:29 thomasrutter 15.6k43967 Change from testdisk to photorec is because testdisk is for undeleting when the partition is healthy, or finding a lost (but healthy) partition. Photorec is for recovering some file types when the partition is corrupt and eg. can't be mounted. – thomasrutter Jul 1 '15 at 0:01 add a comment | up vote 4 down vote Please use parted -l to check the partition type and make sure you are mounting an actual data partition with known partition types (for example, ntfs, fat, etc). Here is what you would see from an 8TB drive, the first partition is not the actual data partition and instead, you should mount the second partition, which is the actual data partition.

To break your text into sections, you can use headers: A Large Header ============== Smaller Subheader ----------------- Use hash marks if you need several levels of headers: # Header 1 # ## Header 2 ## ### Header 3 ### Both bulleted and numbered lists are possible: - Use a minus sign for a bullet + Or plus sign * Or an asterisk 1. Numbered lists are easy 2. Markdown keeps track of the numbers for you 7. So this will be item 3. 1. Lists in a list item: - Indented four spaces. * indented eight spaces. - Four spaces again. 2. You can have multiple paragraphs in a list items. Just be sure to indent. &gt; Create a blockquote by &gt; prepending “&gt;” to each line. &gt; &gt; Other formatting also works here, e.g. &gt; &gt; 1. Lists or &gt; 2. Headings: &gt; &gt; ## Quoted Heading ## You can even put blockquotes in blockquotes: &gt; A standard blockquote is indented &gt; &gt; A nested blockquote is indented more &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You can nest to any depth. To create code blocks or other preformatted text, indent by four spaces: This will be displayed in a monospaced font. The first four spaces will be stripped off, but all other whitespace will be preserved. Markdown and HTML are turned off in code blocks: &lt;i&gt;This is not italic&lt;/i&gt;, and [this is not a link](http://example.com) To create not a block, but an inline code span, use backticks: The `$` character is just a shortcut for `window.jQuery`. If you want to have a preformatted block within a list, indent by eight spaces: 1. This is normal text. 2. So is this, but now follows a code block: Skip a line and indent eight spaces. That's four spaces for the list and four to trigger the code block. If you need to do something that Markdown can't handle, use HTML. Note that we only support a very strict subset of HTML!

Since the BeagleBone black seems to be kind of a reference platform for the YoctoProject, it provides a good instruction how to flash the image. The following instruction is widely taken from this: Table of Contents Preconditions Partition and Format the SD Card Identify SD Device File Setup Partitions on SD Card Format the Partitions Create Mount Point Directories Mount Partitions on SD Card Install the Image Data Boot Loaders Root File System Unmount the SD Card Preconditions You need a Linux host PC, a micro SD card and USB SD card reader in order to prepare the image. Most of the following commands require root priviledges so it is recommended to execute them as user root. Partition and Format the SD Card These steps need to be done only once. The SD card needs to provide two primary partitions. The first one carries the bootloader, the second one the Linux kernel and the user land file system. Identify SD Device File Before you insert the card reader equipped with the SD card where the new image is going to be installed, open up a shell on the Linux host and enter tail -f /var/log/kern.log Insert the card reader to the Linux host and observe the log output which shall be similar to this: kernel: sd 35:0:0:0: [sdb] 61497344 512-byte logical blocks: (31.4 GB/29.3 GiB) kernel: sd 35:0:0:0: [sdb] Write Protect is off ... kernel: sdb: sdb1 sdb2 That means the SD card can be accessed under /dev/sdb. In the example above the card has been already partitioned which is the reason why sdb1 and sdb2 are present as well. Nevertheless the following two steps taken from http://www.armhf.com/boards/beaglebone-black/bbb-sd-install/ explain this. Setup Partitions on SD Card Start the fdisk console application with the following command: fdisk /dev/sdX where /dev/sdX denotes the device file as indicated under point 1. Now create the a new partition table by following these steps: Initialize a new partition table by selecting o, then verify the partition table is empty by selecting p. Create a boot partition by selecting n for ‘new’, then p for ‘primary’, and 1 to specify the first partition. Press enter to accept the default first sector and specify +72261K for specifying the size in kilobytes. Change the partition type to FAT16 by selecting t for ‘type’ and c for ‘W95 FAT32 (LBA)’. Set the partition bootable by selecting a then 1. Next, create the data partition for the root filesystem by selecting n for ‘new’, then p for ‘primary’, and 2 to specify the second partition. Accept the default values for the first and last sectors by pressing enter twice. Press p to ‘print’ the partition table. It should look similar to the one below. Finally, commit the changes by selecting w to ‘write’ the partition table and exit fdisk. Disk /dev/sdb: 7948 MB, 7948206080 bytes 255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 966 cylinders, total 15523840 sectors Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes Disk identifier: 0xafb3f87b . Device Boot Start End Blocks Id System /dev/sdb1 * 2048 146569 72261 c W95 FAT32 (LBA) /dev/sdb2 146570 15759359 7806395 83 Linux Format the Partitions Before formatting unplug and plug again the SD card respectively the USB card reader to allow the driver stack to correctly discover the filesystem partitions. Check that the SD card does still use the same device files as in the given example /dev/sdb by watching the output of tail -f /var/log/messages.Then enter the following commands to create the required filesystems: mkfs.vfat -F 16 -n &quot;boot&quot; /dev/sdb1 mke2fs -j -L &quot;root&quot; /dev/sdb2 Create Mount Point Directories In order to mount the filesystems of newly created partitions on the SD card to the filesystem on the Linux host you need to create two mount point directories. We recommend to put them under the directory mount with the following commands: mkdir /mnt/sd1 mkdir /mnt/sd2 Mount Partitions on SD Card Whenever you insert the SD card or after having successfully executed the steps above you have to mount the directories on the SD card by the following commands: mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/sd1 mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt/sd2 In case the partitions on the SD cards contain already some data you might want to remove it first before actually applying a new or updated image: rm -rf /mnt/sd1/* rm -rf /mnt/sd2/* IN the majority of the cases you will exclusively change the Linux kernel or the content on the Linux file system image. In this case you can keep the first parition as it is and only update the content of the second one. Install the Image Data The following instructions assume that your SD card partitions can be accessed under /dev/sdb1 and /dev/sdb2 as in the example above. It is possible that the SD card uses a different device file on your system which in this case must be used instead. Refer to the first step for further details. After successfull build all image data can be found under ##project_root_folder##/build/tmp-eglibc/deploy/images/ Boot Loaders Install the boot loaders: cp MLO-beaglebone /mnt/sd1/MLO cp u-boot-beaglebone.img /mnt/sd1/u-boot.img Root File System Install the root filesystem: tar x -C /mnt/sd2 -f $IMAGE_TYPE-beaglebone.tar.gz where $IMAGE_TYPE currently denotes to ltenad2 for the standard CDC-RNDIS configuration used with the manufactures images for BeagleBone black or ltenad2-cdc-ncm for the more efficient and modified CDC-NCM drivers as used in connectivity modules based on MDM9640. Unmount the SD Card Whenever you remove the SD card from the host PC you have to unmount its partitions with the following commands: umount /mnt/sd1 umount /mnt/sd2 Status API Training Shop Blog About © 2016 GitHub, Inc.

However, in Linux, we will have to use the terminal program Secure Copy or SCP that’s built-in. Overall, the scp command for copying to a computer (aka use the to computer’s username and ip) is: 1 scp filename usename@ipaddress:/directory/ First we need to find the IP Address of the BBB and the PC, use the following command: 1 ifconfig This is the output from the BBB: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 eth0 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr 1c:ba:8c:98:ef:4f UP BROADCAST MULTICAST MTU:1500 Metric:1 RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0 TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0 collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 RX bytes:0 (0.0 B) TX bytes:0 (0.0 B) Interrupt:40 lo Link encap:Local Loopback inet addr:127.0.0.1 Mask:255.0.0.0 inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host UP LOOPBACK RUNNING MTU:65536 Metric:1 RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0 TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0 collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 RX bytes:0 (0.0 B) TX bytes:0 (0.0 B) usb0 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr c6:ca:a6:85:cf:9e inet addr:192.168.7.2 Bcast:192.168.7.3 Mask:255.255.255.252 inet6 addr: fe80::c4ca:a6ff:fe85:cf9e/64 Scope:Link UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST MTU:1500 Metric:1 RX packets:197352 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0 TX packets:359213 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0 collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 RX bytes:10460267 (9.9 MiB) TX bytes:56807339 (54.1 MiB) And this is the output from the PC: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 eth0 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr ec:a8:6b:f1:ef:ea inet addr:128.180.112.46 Bcast:128.180.115.255 Mask:255.255.252.0 inet6 addr: fe80::eea8:6bff:fef1:efea/64 Scope:Link UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST MTU:1500 Metric:1 RX packets:231823 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0 TX packets:40236 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0 collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 RX bytes:112426350 (112.4 MB) TX bytes:8012706 (8.0 MB) Interrupt:20 Memory:f7c00000-f7c20000 eth3 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr 1c:ba:8c:98:ef:51 inet addr:192.168.7.1 Bcast:192.168.7.3 Mask:255.255.255.252 inet6 addr: fe80::1eba:8cff:fe98:ef51/64 Scope:Link UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST MTU:1500 Metric:1 RX packets:359261 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0 TX packets:197409 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0 collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 RX bytes:35978849 (35.9 MB) TX bytes:21914639 (21.9 MB) lo Link encap:Local Loopback inet addr:127.0.0.1 Mask:255.0.0.0 inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host UP LOOPBACK RUNNING MTU:65536 Metric:1 RX packets:3269 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0 TX packets:3269 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0 collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 RX bytes:429869 (429.8 KB) TX bytes:429869 (429.8 KB) We know that the BBB is connected to the computer by a USB, so look under ubs0, the IP Address is 192.168.7.2 . In addition, the BBB’s user is debian (you can see that in the terminal, the header before you type in the command, the username is before the @ symbol. The string after is the computer name), so we got debian@192.168.7.2 . On the PC’s side, look for the address that start the same as the BBB, we got 192.168.7.1, that’s the PC’s IP Address. The PC’s username is space, so we got space@192.168.7.1 . Example I got a file LEDServer.py on the BBB’s home folder that I want to send to my PC’s home folder. I change directory to that file in the BBB and type in the following (using the BBB’s terminal): 1 scp LEDServer.py space@192.168.7.1:/home/space/ So now, let say I want to copy from PC to BBB, I just replace the username and IP with the BBB’s info and run the same command on the PC’s side.

The options are: DEFAULT: the default analog reference of 5 volts (on 5V Arduino boards) or 3.3 volts (on 3.3V Arduino boards) INTERNAL: an built-in reference, equal to 1.1 volts on the ATmega168 or ATmega328 and 2.56 volts on the ATmega8 (not available on the Arduino Mega) INTERNAL1V1: a built-in 1.1V reference (Arduino Mega only) INTERNAL2V56: a built-in 2.56V reference (Arduino Mega only) EXTERNAL: the voltage applied to the AREF pin (0 to 5V only) is used as the reference. Syntax analogReference(type) Parameters type: which type of reference to use (DEFAULT, INTERNAL, INTERNAL1V1, INTERNAL2V56, or EXTERNAL). Returns None. Note After changing the analog reference, the first few readings from analogRead() may not be accurate. Warning Don't use anything less than 0V or more than 5V for external reference voltage on the AREF pin! If you're using an external reference on the AREF pin, you must set the analog reference to EXTERNAL before calling analogRead(). Otherwise, you will short together the active reference voltage (internally generated) and the AREF pin, possibly damaging the microcontroller on your Arduino board. Alternatively, you can connect the external reference voltage to the AREF pin through a 5K resistor, allowing you to switch between external and internal reference voltages. Note that the resistor will alter the voltage that gets used as the reference because there is an internal 32K resistor on the AREF pin. The two act as a voltage divider, so, for example, 2.5V applied through the resistor will yield 2.5 * 32 / (32 + 5) = ~2.2V at the AREF pin.

The project was developed during Google Summer of Code '13. Build sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev automake ./autogen.sh ./configure make Usage Press the S2 button on the BeagleBone Black and apply power to the board. The board should start now into USB boot mode. Connect the board to the host PC. The kernel should now identify your board as an RNDIS interface. Be sure you do not have any BOOTP servers on your network. Go to bin/ and execute flash_script.sh It needs the flashing image as argument to be provided. For now only .xz compressed images are supported. sudo ./flash_script.sh [ debian | ubuntu | image.xz ] debian and ubuntu will use tarball from armhf.com website If there are bugs please feel free to contact me. How to build the binary blobs The full system works as follow: The AM335x ROM when in USB boot mode exposes a RNDIS interface to the PC and waits to TFTP a binary blob that it executes. That binary blob is the SPL Once the SPL runs it applies the same proceure as the ROM and TFTPs U-Boot Again U-Boot applies the same thinking and TFTPs a FIT(flatten image tree) which includes a Kernel, Ramdisk and the DTB U-Boot runs this FIT and boots the Kernel When the kernel starts the init script exports the eMMC using the g_mass_storage kernel module as an USB stick to the Linux so it can be flashed Building U-Boot for USB booting Grab the latest U-Boot sources from git://git.denx.de/u-boot.git Checkout commit id 524123a70761110c5cf3ccc5f52f6d4da071b959 Install your favourite cross-compiler, I am using arm-linux-gnueabihf- Apply this patch to U-Boot sources https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ungureanuvladvictor/BBBlfs/master/tools/USB_FLash.patch make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- am335x_evm_usbspl_config make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- Now you have u-boot.img which is the uboot binary and spl/u-boot-spl.bin which is the spl binary Building the Kernel Grab the latest from https://github.com/beagleboard/kernel git checkout 3.14 ./patch.sh cp configs/beaglebone kernel/arch/arm/configs/beaglebone_defconfig wget http://arago-project.org/git/projects/?p=am33x-cm3.git\;a=blob_plain\;f=bin/am335x-pm-firmware.bin\;hb=HEAD -O kernel/firmware/am335x-pm-firmware.bin cd kernel make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- beaglebone_defconfig -j4 make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- zImage dtbs modules -j4 After compilation you have in arch/arm/boot/ the zImage Building the ramdisk Our initramfs will be built around BusyBox.

These modes are very useful for testing new plays or debugging. Start-at-task¶ If you want to start executing your playbook at a particular task, you can do so with the --start-at-task option: ansible-playbook playbook.yml --start-at-task=&quot;install packages&quot; The above will start executing your playbook at a task named “install packages”. Step¶ Playbooks can also be executed interactively with --step: ansible-playbook playbook.yml --step This will cause ansible to stop on each task, and ask if it should execute that task. Say you had a task called “configure ssh”, the playbook run will stop and ask: Perform task: configure ssh (y/n/c): Answering “y” will execute the task, answering “n” will skip the task, and answering “c” will continue executing all the remaining tasks without asking.

This is one of the problems I have been facing and here is a possible solution. Looking at your lsusb output, I find the following: Bus 002 Device 004: ID 19d2:1405 ZTE WCDMA Technologies MSM This indicates that the Vendor ID is 0x19d2 and the Product ID is 0x1405. I would advise you the following steps: (1) Create a bash script as follows. This bash script is to be run, everytime you would like to use your mobile modem CDMA connection. Let us suppose that the name of the bash script is `myModem.sh. Do this by typing: sudo nano ~/myModem.sh Type in the following lines here: #!/bin/bash sudo /sbin/modprobe usbserial vendor=0x19d2 product=0x1405 Save your script and exit from nano. Type: sudo chmod +x ~/myModem.sh (2) Run the following commands: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade sudo apt-get install wvdial sudo apt-get install usb-modeswitch usb-modeswitch-data (4) Type the following: sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/90-zte.rules and type in the following line (it is a single line and no carriage returns please): SUBSYSTEM==&quot;block&quot;,SUBSYSTEM==&quot;scsi&quot;,ATTRS{model}==&quot;USB Storage 1405&quot;,ACTION==&quot;add&quot;,RUN+=&quot;/sbin/modprobe usbserial vendor=0x19d2 product=0x1405&quot; Save the file and exit from nano. (5) Now run your bash script from your home directory: sudo ~/myModem.sh (6) Now we have to configure wvdial. sudo wvdialconf /etc/wvdial.conf This will detect the modem and create a configuration file. (7) Edit the configuration file to adjust the setting according to your country/service provider. Especially change the dialing phone number, username and password. Do this by typing sudo nano /etc/wvdial.conf Remove the semicolons before the phone, username and password. The semicolons tell wvdial that these lines are commented. Save your file and exit from nano. (8) Now create your connection. Make sure you check the Connect Automatically option. I hope this will set your modem working. share|improve this answer edited Nov 19 '13 at 14:25 community wiki 2 revs Indian I tried this method, but couldn't get my modem to work.

Uninteresting Misleading Offensive Repetitive Other Oops! I didn't mean to do this. up vote 1 down vote I had the same problem with ubuntu 13.10 detecting ZTE MF667 as ethernet connection. The solution posted here didn't work for me, as wvdial was not able to detect it as a modem - which makes perfect sense, because it is an ethernet device. After trying different solutions, I stumbled upon this: http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch/bb/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=1662 And finally I understood, that there is no problem with usb-modeswitch or anything! You don't need to configure your connection in the ethernet settings at all. As I use it with an O2 sim card, I just connect to the ZTE ethernet connection, open my browser and go to &quot;o2surf.stick&quot; (this might be similar for your provider). I found this when I tried to run the setup.exe provided on the ZTE in Wine. There I can enter the PIN (can be disabled in the settings later) and connect to the mobile network. After that everything works fine :) The interface provided by o2 reminds me of our wlan router config. You can see there your connection duration and the data volume used. Sorry, if my English is somewhat awkward... I hope, this might help some people. share|improve this answer answered Nov 28 '13 at 10:48 Tinkerbell 111 On the Telstra 3G USB+WiFi version of this, the configuration settings page is at m.home – tudor Apr 22 '14 at 2:12 add a comment | Your Answer draft saved draft discarded Sign up or log in Sign up using Google Sign up using Facebook Sign up using Email and Password Post as a guest Name Email discard By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service.

For information on editing or updating your sources list see SourcesList. Introduction to APT &quot;In the beginning there was the .tar.gz. Users had to compile each program that they wanted to use on their GNU/Linux systems. When Debian was created, it was deemed necessary that the system include a method of managing the packages installed on the machine. The name dpkg was given to this system. Thus the famous 'package' first came into being on GNU/Linux, a while before Red Hat decided to create their own 'rpm' system. A new dilemma quickly took hold of the minds of the makers of GNU/Linux. They needed a rapid, practical, and efficient way to install packages that would manage dependencies automatically and take care of their configuration files while upgrading. Here again, Debian led the way and gave birth to APT, the Advanced Packaging Tool, which has since been ported by Conectiva for use with rpm and has been adopted by some other distributions.&quot; -- From Debian APT HOWTO Commands IconsPage/info.png All these commands except the search commands must be run as root or with superuser privileges, see sudo for more information. IconsPage/example.png sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop Installation commands apt-get install &lt;package_name&gt; This command installs a new package. apt-get build-dep &lt;package_name&gt; This command searches the repositories and installs the build dependencies for &lt;package_name&gt;. If the package is not in the repositories it will return an error. aptitude install &lt;package_name&gt; Aptitude is an Ncurses viewer of packages installed or available. Aptitude can be used from the command line in a similar way to apt-get. See man aptitude for more information. APT and aptitude will accept multiple package names as a space delimited list. For example: apt-get install &lt;package1_name&gt; &lt;package2_name&gt; &lt;package3_name&gt; IconsPage/note.png Use the -s flag to simulate an action.&quot;sudo apt-get -s install &lt;package_name&gt;&quot; will simulate installing the package showing you what packages will be installed and configured. auto-apt auto-apt run &lt;command_string&gt; When invoked, the auto-apt command automatically installs packages upon missing file access. If a program tries to access a file known to belong in an uninstalled package, auto-apt will install that package using apt-get. This feature requires apt and sudo to work. Auto-apt keeps databases which need to be kept up-to-date in order for it to be effective. This is achieved by calling the commands auto-apt update, auto-apt updatedb and auto-apt update-local. Usage example IconsPage/example.png You're compiling a program and, all of a sudden, there's an error because it needs a file you don't have. The program auto-apt asks you to install packages if they're needed, stopping the relevant process and continuing once the package is installed. # auto-apt run ./configure It will then ask to install the needed packages and call apt-get automatically. If you're running X, a graphical interface will replace the default text interface. Maintenance commands apt-get update Run this command after changing /etc/apt/sources.list or /etc/apt/preferences . For information regarding /etc/apt/preferences, see PinningHowto. Run this command periodically to make sure your source list is up-to-date. This is the equivalent of &quot;Reload&quot; in Synaptic or &quot;Fetch updates&quot; in Adept. apt-get upgrade This command upgrades all installed packages. This is the equivalent of &quot;Mark all upgrades&quot; in Synaptic. apt-get dist-upgrade The same as the above, except add the &quot;smart upgrade&quot; checkbox. It tells APT to use &quot;smart&quot; conflict resolution system, and it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the expense of less important ones if necessary. IconsPage/note.png &quot;apt-get dist-upgrade&quot; does not upgrade from a previous version of Ubuntu. For more information of upgrading from a previous version of Ubuntu see http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading . apt-get check This command is a diagnostic tool. It does an update of the package lists and checks for broken dependencies. apt-get -f install This command does the same thing as Edit-&gt;Fix Broken Packages in Synaptic. Do this if you get complaints about packages with &quot;unmet dependencies&quot;. apt-get autoclean This command removes .deb files for packages that are no longer installed on your system. Depending on your installation habits, removing these files from /var/cache/apt/archives may regain a significant amount of diskspace. apt-get clean The same as above, except it removes all packages from the package cache. This may not be desirable if you have a slow Internet connection, since it will cause you to redownload any packages you need to install a program. The package cache is in /var/cache/apt/archives . The command du -sh /var/cache/apt/archives will tell you how much space cached packages are consuming. dpkg-reconfigure &lt;package_name&gt; Reconfigure the named package. With many packages, you’ll be prompted with some configuration questions you may not have known were there. IconsPage/example.png For example: dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig-config will present you with a &quot;wizard&quot; on configuring fonts in Ubuntu. echo &quot;&lt;package_name&gt; hold&quot; | dpkg --set-selections This command places the desired package on hold. TODO: Bug #42178: This is the same as Synaptic's Package-&gt;Lock Version. */ IconsPage/info.png This command may have the unintended side effect of preventing upgrades to packages that depend on updated versions of the pinned package. apt-get dist-upgrade will override this, but will warn you first. If you want to use this command with sudo, you need to use echo &quot;&lt;package_name&gt; hold&quot; | sudo dpkg --set-selections not sudo echo &quot;&lt;package_name&gt; hold&quot; | dpkg --set-selections. echo &quot;&lt;package_name&gt; install&quot; | dpkg --set-selections This command removes the &quot;hold&quot; or &quot;locked package&quot; state set by the above command. The note above about sudo usage applies to this command. Removal commands apt-get remove &lt;package_name&gt; This command removes an installed package, leaving configuration files intact. apt-get purge &lt;package_name&gt; This command completely removes a package and the associated configuration files. Configuration files residing in ~ are not usually affected by this command. + operator IconsPage/example.png If you want to remove package1 and install package2 in one step: apt-get remove &lt;package1&gt; &lt;package2&gt;+ . apt-get autoremove This command removes packages that were installed by other packages and are no longer needed. apt-get autoremove &lt;package_name&gt; This command removes an installed package and dependencies. While there is no built in way to remove all of your configuration information from your removed packages you can remove all configuration data from every removed package with the following command. dpkg -l | grep '^rc' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs dpkg --purge Search commands apt-cache search &lt;search_term&gt; This command will find packages that include &lt;search_term&gt;. dpkg -l *&lt;search_term&gt;* This will find packages whose names contain &lt;search_term&gt;. Similar to apt-cache search, but also shows whether a package is installed on your system by marking it with ii (installed) and un (not installed). apt-cache show &lt;package_name&gt; This command shows the description of package &lt;package_name&gt; and other relevant information including version, size, dependencies and conflicts. dpkg --print-avail &lt;package_name&gt; This command is similar to &quot;apt-cache show&quot;. dpkg -L &lt;package_name&gt; This command will list files in package &lt;package_name&gt;. dpkg -c foo.deb This command lists files in the package &quot;foo.deb&quot;. Note that foo.deb is a pathname. Use this command on .deb packages that you have manually downloaded. dlocate &lt;package_name&gt; This command determines which installed package owns &lt;package_name&gt;. It shows files from installed packages that match &lt;package_name&gt;, with the name of the package they came from. Consider this to be a &quot;reverse lookup&quot; utility. IconsPage/info.png In order to use this command, the package dlocate must be installed on your system. dpkg -S &lt;filename_search_pattern&gt; This command does the same as dlocate, but does not require the installation of any additional packages. It is slower than dlocate but has the advantage of being installed by default on all Debian and Ubuntu systems. apt-file search &lt;filename_search_pattern&gt; This command acts like dlocate and dpkg -S, but searches all available packages. It answers the question, &quot;what package provides this file?&quot;. apt-file needs to be updated regularly like apt-get. Use the command: apt-file update IconsPage/info.png In order to use this command, the package apt-file must be installed on your system. apt-cache pkgnames This command provides a listing of every package in the system A general note on searching: If searching generates a list that is too long, you can filter your results by piping them through the command grep. Examples: apt-cache search &lt;filename&gt; | grep -w &lt;filename&gt; will show only the files that contain &lt;filename&gt; as a whole word dpkg -L package | grep /usr/bin will list files located in the directory /usr/bin, useful if you're looking for a particular executable. For more information on apt-get, apt-cache and dpkg consult their manual pages by using the man command. These manuals will provide a wider scope of information in addition to all of the options that you can use with each program. IconsPage/example.png Example: man apt-get . Typical usage example I want to feel the wind in my hair, I want the adrenaline of speed. So let's install a racing game. But what racing games are available? apt-cache search racing game It gives me a lot of answers. I see a game named &quot;torcs&quot;. Let's get some more information on this game. apt-cache show torcs Hmmm... it seems interesting. But is this game not already installed on my computer? And what is the available version? Which repository is it from (Universe or Main)? apt-cache policy torcs Ok, so now, let's install it! apt-get install torcs What is the command I must type in the console to launch this game? In this example, it's straightforward (&quot;torcs&quot;), but that's not always the case. One way of finding the name of the binary is to look at what files the package has installed in &quot;/usr/bin&quot;. For games, the binary will be in &quot;/usr/games&quot;. For administrative programs, it's in &quot;/usr/sbin&quot;. dpkg -L torcs | grep /usr/games/ The first part of the command display all files installed by the package &quot;torcs&quot; (try it). With the second part, we ask to only display lines containing &quot;/usr/games/&quot;. Hmmm, that game is cool. Maybe there are some extra tracks? apt-cache search torcs But I'm running out of space. I will delete the apt cache! apt-get clean Oh no, my mother asked me to remove all games from this computer. But I want to keep the configuration files so I can simply re-install it later. apt-get remove torcs If I want to also remove config files : apt-get purge torcs Setting up apt-get to use a http-proxy These are three methods of using apt-get with a http-proxy. Temporary proxy session This is a temporary method that you can manually use each time you want to use apt-get through a http-proxy. This method is useful if you only want to temporarily use a http-proxy. Enter this line in the terminal prior to using apt-get (substitute your details for yourproxyaddress and proxyport). export http_proxy=http://yourproxyaddress:proxyport If you normally use sudo to run apt-get you will need to login as root first for this to work unless you also add some explicit environment settings to /etc/sudoers, e.g. Defaults env_keep = &quot;http_proxy https_proxy ftp_proxy&quot; APT configuration file method This method uses the apt.conf file which is found in your /etc/apt/ directory. This method is useful if you only want apt-get (and not other applications) to use a http-proxy permanently. IconsPage/info.png On some installations there will be no apt-conf file set up. This procedure will either edit an existing apt-conf file or create a new apt-conf file. gksudo gedit /etc/apt/apt.conf Add this line to your /etc/apt/apt.conf file (substitute your details for yourproxyaddress and proxyport). Acquire::http::Proxy &quot;http://yourproxyaddress:proxyport&quot;; Save the apt.conf file. BASH rc method This method adds a two lines to your .bashrc file in your $HOME directory. This method is useful if you would like apt-get and other applications for instance wget, to use a http-proxy. gedit ~/.bashrc Add these lines to the bottom of your ~/.bashrc file (substitute your details for yourproxyaddress and proxyport) http_proxy=http://yourproxyaddress:proxyport export http_proxy Save the file. Close your terminal window and then open another terminal window or source the ~/.bashrc file: source ~/.bashrc Test your proxy with sudo apt-get update and whatever networking tool you desire. You can use firestarter or conky to see active connections. If you make a mistake and go back to edit the file again, you can close the terminal and reopen it or you can source ~/.bashrc as shown above. source ~/.bashrc How to login a proxy user If you need to login to the Proxy server this can be achieved in most cases by using the following layout in specifying the proxy address in http-proxy. (substitute your details for username, password, yourproxyaddress and proxyport) http_proxy=http://username:password@yourproxyaddress:proxyport Useful additional packages Deborphan Debfoster See also Repositories/CommandLine For further apt-get goodness see PinningHowto.

                   NS1:content=" The Geek Stuff ≡ Menu Home Free eBook Start Here Contact About Ping Tutorial: 15 Effective Ping Command Examples by Ramesh Natarajan on November 30, 2009 Linux Ping Command for Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora - ExamplesAs you already know, ping command is used to find out whether the peer host/gateway is reachable. If you are thinking ping is such a simple command and why do I need 15 examples, you should read the rest of the article. Ping command provides lot more options than what you might already know. Ping Example 1. Increase or Decrease the Time Interval Between Packets By default ping waits for 1 second before sending the next packet. You can increase or decrease this using option -i as shown below. Increase Ping Time Interval Example: Wait for 5 seconds before sending the next packet. $ ping -i 5 IP Decrease Ping Time Interval Example: Wait 0.1 seconds before sending the next packet. # ping -i 0.1 IP Note: Only super user can specify interval less than 0.2 seconds. If not, you’ll get the following error message. $ ping -i 0.1 127.0.0.1 PING 0 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data. ping: cannot flood; minimal interval, allowed for user, is 200ms Ping Example 2. Check whether the local network interface is up and running Before checking whether the peer machine is reachable, first check whether the local network network is up and running using any one of the following 3 methods. Ping localhost using zero (0) This is probably the easiest and simplest way to ping a local host $ ping 0 PING 0 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data. 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.024 ms ^C Ping localhost using name $ ping localhost PING localhost (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data. 64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.051 ms 64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.055 ms ^C --- localhost ping statistics --- 2 packets transmitted, 2 received, 0% packet loss, time 999ms rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.051/0.053/0.055/0.002 ms Ping localhost using ip $ ping 127.0.0.1 To quit the ping command, send SIGINT signal by pressing CTRL+C. If you have not specified any option to make the ping to exit automatically, then you will be terminating using CTRL+C ( SIGINT ) which will show the statistics and then terminate the ping process. When everything is working properly, it should say ‘0% packet loss’ 2 packets transmitted, 2 received, 0% packet loss, time 999ms rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.051/0.053/0.055/0.002 ms Ping Example 3. Send N packets and stop Send N packets specified with -c option and then stop. This way the ping command can exit automatically instead of pressing CTRL+C to exit. In the following example, ping command sends 5 packets, and waits for response from the destination host. Ping will exit after receiving the response or error. $ ping -c 5 google.com PING google.com (74.125.45.100) 56(84) bytes of data. 64 bytes from yx-in-f100.google.com (74.125.45.100): icmp_seq=1 ttl=44 time=731 ms 64 bytes from yx-in-f100.google.com (74.125.45.100): icmp_seq=2 ttl=44 time=777 ms 64 bytes from yx-in-f100.google.com (74.125.45.100): icmp_seq=3 ttl=44 time=838 ms 64 bytes from yx-in-f100.google.com (74.125.45.100): icmp_seq=4 ttl=44 time=976 ms 64 bytes from yx-in-f100.google.com (74.125.45.100): icmp_seq=5 ttl=44 time=1071 ms --- google.com ping statistics --- 5 packets transmitted, 5 received, 0% packet loss, time 4216ms rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 731.039/879.129/1071.050/126.625 ms Ping Example 4. Show Version and Exit Display the current version of ping program using -V option. $ ping -V ping utility, iputils-sss20071127 Ping Example 5. Flood the network Super users can send hundred or more packets per second using -f option. It prints a ‘.’ when a packet is sent, and a backspace is printed when a packet is received. As shown below, ping -f has sent more than 400,000 packets in few seconds. # ping -f localhost PING localhost (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data. .^C --- localhost ping statistics --- 427412 packets transmitted, 427412 received, 0% packet loss, time 10941ms rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.003/0.004/1.004/0.002 ms, ipg/ewma 0.025/0.004 ms Ping Example 6. Audible ping: Give beep when the peer is reachable This option is useful for sysadmin during troubleshooting. There is no need for you to look at the ping output after each and every change. You can continue working with your changes, and when the remote machine become reachable you’ll hear the beep automatically. $ ping -a IP Note: It can give beep only from terminal number 1 through 7 and gnome-terminal ( It will not work in console ). Ping Example 7. Find out the IP address You can identify the ip-address using the host name as shown below. $ ping -c 1 google.com PING google.com (74.125.67.100) 56(84) bytes of data. 64 bytes from gw-in-f100.google.com (74.125.67.100): icmp_seq=1 ttl=43 time=287 ms --- google.com ping statistics --- 1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 287.903/287.903/287.903/0.000 ms Ping Example 8. Print Only Ping Command Summary Statistics Use option -q to view only the ping statistics summary as shown below. $ ping -c 5 -q 127.0.0.1 PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data. --- 127.0.0.1 ping statistics --- 5 packets transmitted, 5 received, 0% packet loss, time 3998ms rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.047/0.053/0.061/0.009 ms Ping Example 9. Change Ping Packet Size You can change the packet size of ping command using -s option. Example: Change the default packet size from 56 to 100. $ ping -s 100 localhost PING localhost (127.0.0.1) 100(128) bytes of data. 108 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.022 ms 108 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.021 ms 108 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.020 ms ^C --- localhost ping statistics --- 3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 1998ms rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.020/0.021/0.022/0.000 ms Ping Packet Size In the above example, when we set the packet size to 100, it displays ‘128 bytes’ in the output. This is because of the Ping packet header size, which is 28 bytes. So, if you specify the packet size as 100, 28 bytes for header will be added to it and 128 bytes will be sent. Ping Bytes Sent = Ping Packet Size + Ping Header Packet Size (28 bytes) Ping Example 10. Timeout -w Ping -w option specifies the deadline to terminate the ping output. This specifies the total number of seconds the ping command should send packets to the remote host. The following example will ping for 5 seconds. i.e ping command will exit after 5 seconds irrespective of how many packets are sent or received. $ ping -w 5 localhost Note: When you specify both -w, and -c, whichever comes first will terminate the ping command. Ping Example 11. Online ping Ping from different locations and check the reachability (availability or time for reaching) of your server from different locations. If you want to do an online ping, try just ping. Ping Example 12. Option -w or -c Exits Ping $ ping -c 4 0 -w 2 PING 0 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data. 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.064 ms 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.060 ms 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.058 ms --- 0 ping statistics --- 3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 1998ms rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.058/0.060/0.064/0.009 ms $ ping -c 4 0 -w 10 PING 0 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data. 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.063 ms 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.060 ms 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.055 ms 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=0.061 ms --- 0 ping statistics --- 4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 2997ms rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.055/0.059/0.063/0.009 ms Ping Example 13. Shorter statistics with SIGQUIT While ping is printing the individual packet status, when you want to view the shorter statistics you can use this technique. Pressing CTRL+| (Control key followed by pipe symbol) for the shows the summary in between, and continues with it packet sending and receiving process. $ ping -w 100 localhost PING localhost (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data. 64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=10 ttl=64 time=0.021 ms 64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=11 ttl=64 time=0.022 ms 11/11 packets, 0% loss, min/avg/ewma/max = 0.020/0.022/0.022/0.024 ms 64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=12 ttl=64 time=0.021 ms 64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=13 ttl=64 time=0.022 ms 64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=14 ttl=64 time=0.021 ms 64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=15 ttl=64 time=0.021 ms 19/19 packets, 0% loss, min/avg/ewma/max = 0.020/0.022/0.022/0.024 ms 64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=31 ttl=64 time=0.022 ms 64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=32 ttl=64 time=0.022 ms 32/32 packets, 0% loss, min/avg/ewma/max = 0.020/0.022/0.022/0.027 ms 64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=33 ttl=64 time=0.023 ms .. Ping Example 14. Specify path for ping to send the packet You can also specify through which path the ping should send the packet to destination. $ ping hop1 hop2 hop3 .. hopN destination $ ping 192.168.3.33 192.168.7.1 192.168.4.45 Note: If one of the hop in the path is not reachable then you will have failure in pinging. Ping Example 15. Record and print route of how ECHO_REQUEST sent and ECHO_REPLY received It records, and prints the network route through which the packet is sent and received. This is useful for network engineers who wish to know how the packet is sent and received. $ ping -R 192.168.1.63 PING 192.168.1.63 (192.168.1.63) 56(84) bytes of data. 64 bytes from 192.168.1.63: icmp_seq=1 ttl=61 time=2.05 ms RR: 192.168.9.118 192.168.3.25 192.168.10.35 192.168.1.26 192.168.1.63 192.168.1.63 192.168.10.4 192.168.3.10 192.168.4.25 64 bytes from 192.168.1.63: icmp_seq=2 ttl=61 time=2.00 ms (same route) &gt; Add your comment If you enjoyed this article, you might also like.. 50 Linux Sysadmin Tutorials 50 Most Frequently Used Linux Commands (With Examples) Top 25 Best Linux Performance Monitoring and Debugging Tools Mommy, I found it! – 15 Practical Linux Find Command Examples Linux 101 Hacks 2nd Edition eBook Linux 101 Hacks Book Awk Introduction – 7 Awk Print Examples Advanced Sed Substitution Examples 8 Essential Vim Editor Navigation Fundamentals 25 Most Frequently Used Linux IPTables Rules Examples Turbocharge PuTTY with 12 Powerful Add-Ons Bash 101 Hacks Book Sed and Awk 101 Hacks Book Nagios Core 3 Book Vim 101 Hacks Book Tagged as: Linux Ping Command, Ping -t, Ping Command, Ping Examples, Unix Ping Command { 38 comments… add one } Salih November 30, 2009, 7:21 pm Hi Ramesh, Good Article.

Link Ramesh Natarajan December 10, 2009, 5:55 pm @Salih, Diptanu, Thanks for the comment. I’m very glad you found this article helpful. @Raghu, Yes. Lot of people underestimate the power of ping. @Sravan, If you are trying to do a ‘ping -a’ on a remote server, you’ll hear the beep only on the host where the ping command is getting executed. For example, from your laptop, if you’ve ssh-ed to dev-db and executing ‘ping -a google.com’ on dev-db, you’ll hear the beep only on the dev-db box. @Netspider, That is strange. I’m not sure why that is happening. When you do, ping 0, it is supposed to ping only the local host and not even the gateway. Are there any strange entries in your /etc/hosts file? Link Reza December 21, 2009, 12:17 am Thanks for your very nice tutorial. Could you please also help me with these two questions: 1- Ping claims to give an estimation about RTT(Round Trip Time) for SPECIFIC PACKET SIZE. But as it shows the packet that is coming back is 20Bytes less. So we have a RTT for which packet size (86 which goes or 66 which is coming back) ? 2-What does “mdev” means in mid/avg/max/mdev TQ Link Anonymous March 23, 2011, 5:12 am superb article Link saikrishna July 18, 2011, 4:09 am super article Link TK Nallappan August 6, 2011, 4:36 pm Hi All, Here is the command to protect yourself from a form of attack known as a ‘ping flood’ # sysctl -w net.ipv4.icmp_echoreply_rate=10 Link Greg Janssen October 27, 2011, 12:38 pm This must not be about Windows XP!

A better way to determine IP is dig: ~ ~&gt; dig +short google.com 173.194.70.101 173.194.70.139 … In order to try “drill” I had to install /usr/ports/dns/ldns, but in my taste the “dig” is better.

Can you tell me how to loop pinging a particular IP after regular intervals of time. Ex: Say suppose I have an IP: a.b.c.d I want to ping this IP every 300sec. What is to be done? Link NetSpider December 16, 2013, 2:22 pm Ujwal, you can use -i key: -i wait Wait wait seconds between sending *each packet*. Or you can use bash-script: while :; do ping -c yy a.b.c.d; sleep xx; done This script will send yy icmp-packets every xx seconds. Link Vitalie March 24, 2014, 2:12 am Also you could include -r option. -r – direct ping without taking in account routing table. Problem: need to check if we have wire electrical connection. lnx#&gt; ping -r Link gandhimathi April 20, 2014, 6:14 pm Hi Ramesh, This is very useful article. I have a question. The time displayed in the ping statistics is taken from where? Is the time taken to run the the ping command? for example, 5 packets transmitted, 5 received, 0% packet loss, time 3998ms Then no.of packets sent * avg RTT is the time taken to send and receive is the time taken for the pings right. Why both the times are not equal? Link Bobin chacko April 24, 2014, 11:27 am hi I tried to use the command ping -c 5 google.com it gives me a message that access denied option -c requires administrative privileges… while I am logged in as administrator with an elevated command prompt please help Link Ritesh April 25, 2014, 1:11 am If I ping using hostname it does not ping.

Install the packages netbase, ifupdown, and ppp if you don't have them already: apt-get install netbase ifupdown ppp Create a file /etc/ppp/peers/gprs with this content: user &quot;YOUR_USERNAME&quot; connect &quot;/usr/sbin/chat -v -f /etc/chatscripts/gprs -T YOUR_APN&quot; /dev/ttyUSB0 noipdefault defaultroute replacedefaultroute hide-password #lcp-echo-interval 30 #lcp-echo-failure 4 noauth persist #mtu 1492 #maxfail 0 #holdoff 20 usepeerdns #Optional, make it always appear as ppp2: #unit 2 Then edit /etc/ppp/chap-secrets and add at the end: &quot;YOUR_USERNAME&quot; * &quot;YOUR_PASSWORD&quot; Similarly, edit /etc/ppp/pap-secrets and add at the end: &quot;YOUR_USERNAME&quot; * &quot;YOUR_PASSWORD&quot; Then edit /etc/network/interfaces and add the following: auto gprs iface gprs inet ppp provider gprs Thats all you need most of the time. The connection will be brought up at boot, you can start it with ifup gprs or stop it with ifdown gprs. Advanced Installation with WVDial You need to download the new wvdial.conf for the HSDPA stuff to work !!! This was originally written for Gentoo Linux which compiles everything from source. As a result of things might be a bit different, but we can work around it. Firstly, we need to get Linux to detect your card, start your PCMCIA services - normally this can be done using (most distros do this for you): Before you insert your card, open a console/switch to an open console and as root run the following : invoke-rc.d pcmciautils start This will allow you to &quot;see&quot; what Linux is doing : tail -f /var/log/messages Right, now insert your card and you should see some stuff happening. I have included log traces of what the two cards &quot;look&quot; like under /var/log/messages in the attachment section. If you see only the option_insert_nousb.txt messages using an option card run the following command: modprobe usbserial vendor=0x0af0 product=0x5000 If you had to run the above command, you will need to save the vmc_g file attached into /etc/modules.d. Now we need to find out where your card is - you will see in the messages where the card is - /dev/ttyS* for Novatel or /dev/ttyUSB* for Option: find /dev/ | grep ttyS Should show /dev/ttyS0 or /dev/ttyS1 for a Novatel Card. find /dev/ | grep ttyUSB Should show /dev/ttyUSB0 and USB1 and USB2 for an Option Card. (or /dev/tts/ttyUSB0-2 for udev) Once we found that, we need to change /etc/wvdial.conf to match your settings, attached is my working wvdial.conf (this one is tested on GSM network Play in Poland, with e169 modem, but uses no specific options so should be very portable). The file is: [Dialer Defaults] Modem = /dev/ttyUSB0 Baud = 3600000 Init1 = ATZ Init2 = ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &amp;C1 &amp;D2 +FCLASS=0 Phone = *99# Username = ppp Password = ppp Ask Password = 0 Dial Command = ATDT Stupid Mode = 1 Compuserve = 0 Idle Seconds = 0 ISDN = 0 Auto DNS = 1 It is possible to set the PIN that is sent to modem to unlock SIM card, how ever this example does not use this option (you should search for it). Some SIM cards do not need the PIN to work as modems. Now we can start dialing up. For Novatel wvdial novatel internet 3gonly 384k For Option wvdial option internet 3gonly 384k If you need to send your PIN, add &quot;pin&quot; infront of all the commands, e.g. wvdial pin novatel internet 3gonly 384k Once your connection is up - surf away Now you can setup things like KPPP and Gnome's Modem Lights to do your dialing for you. Extra Steps for the HSDPA card Download the kernel module from the link below. Extract it to a directory somewhere safe. Compile the driver using the following commands: make clean &amp;&amp; make Once this is done, run the following command to insert the module into the kernel insmod nozomi.ko Once you have done that, use the following command to setup the connection: wvdial hsdpa Extra steps for the Novatel U740 Card Until I get time to update the files etc. our Novatel Linux Users out there can just type this command before using the normal dialing command: modprobe usbserial vendor=0x1410 product=0x1400 OR modprobe usbserial vendor=0x1410 product=0x1410 Using lsusb will show you the Vendor and Product ID's or cat /proc/bus/usb/devices will do the same.I will still add them into the FAQ but at least this should help for now This will add the USB's like the 3G Option did - am I seeing a swap here ? - so just dial /dev/ttyUSB0 or so - check the logs Extra Steps for the Huawei Cards None really - just make sure usbserial is loaded and the card will come up on /dev/ttyUSB0 - check the logs again to confirm If the card doesn't come up, unload usbserial and reload with the following command: rmmod usbserial modprobe usbserial vendor=0x12d1 product=0x1001 I am still trying to work on the USB only card, so at the moment, I don't know if it will work under Linux. Huawei E169 Tested by rfree on Debian Wheezy with Polish operator Play. All works well: make sure with stat /dev/ttyUSB0 that such device-file is (re)created when you connect the modem (and wait 10 seconds), the date of file should change. if device-file is not created (or if something does not work) then force the modem to work as modem only instead as card-reader/memory, using: rmmod usb_storage modprobe usbserial vendor=0x0af0 product=0x5000 # (or adjust vendor and product number to the ones you see in dmesg or lsusb when you look for your modem) copy the attached example file wvdial.conf-e169 to /etc/wvdial.conf run wvdial (install wvdial if you don't have it) - and should be done Huawei E220 I have found that this modem will only work with the short cable supplied...not the long one with two plugs...*shrug* Same as the E620, except use the following modprobe command: rmmod usb-storage modprobe usbserial vendor=0x12d1 product=0x1003 (Some have reported an ID of 0x1001 - use lsusb to confirm) After that, you will notice only one USB serial coming up, then, remove the device and re-attach it, you shouldn't need to re-insert usbserial. Notes I have only seen 3G speeds on this device, but I think it is because of my RF conditions and location. More on this to follow... How to connect using a Franklin U210 USB wireless/WAN/mobile broadband modem Though this section needs work, it documents how one Debian user connects to the Internet over NTelos' cellular network in the United States using a Franklin CDMA EV-DO U210 USB modem. NTelos uses Sprint's network, and moreover it would appear that Franklin's U210 is the base model of Franklin's U-series (U210, U600, U601, U602, U770, U772), so there is a reasonably good chance that you can use this information even if your situation differs somewhat from the writer's -- but, as they say, your mileage may vary. This advice is targeted to the beginning-to-intermediate user. Advanced users are challenged to edit the wiki to improve the advice. Your Franklin USB modem presents itself to the wireless network as though it were a cell phone. It has a phone number. To connect, it calls another phone number. On NTelos' (and presumably also on Sprint's) network in the United States, the phone number your USB modem must call is &quot;#777&quot;. You need not, but probably can, discover your USB modem's own phone number by logging into your account on your cellular provider's website. The only number you need today however is the &quot;#777&quot;. As root or via sudo(1), install the Debian package &quot;wvdial&quot;, for instance by $ sudo apt-get install wvdial If desired, save the original state of /etc/wvdial.conf using RCS's ci(1) or the like (you can ignore this advice re RCS if you neither know nor care what it is about). Edit /etc/wvdial.conf to look something like this: [Dialer Defaults] Stupid Mode = true Init1 = ATZ Init2 = ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &amp;C1 &amp;D2 +FCLASS=0 Modem Type = USB Modem Baud = 460800 New PPPD = yes Modem = /dev/ttyACM0 ISDN = 0 Phone = #777 Password = &lt;Your Password&gt; Username = &lt;Your Login Name&gt; The important lines are the &quot;Stupid Mode = true&quot; and the &quot;Phone = #777&quot;. You need not fill in a password or username. Edit &quot;/etc/group&quot; [again after using ci(1) first if you wish] to change dialout:x:20: to dialout:x:20:foo typing your username in place of &quot;foo&quot;. At this point, you may need to log out and log back in to get the system (which part of the system? not sure) to recognize that you now belong to the &quot;dialout&quot; group. If unsure, check with the groups(1) command. Plug in your USB modem if you have not already done so. Not as root but as yourself, give the command &quot;wvdial&quot; at the terminal's command line. If all goes well, this should connect you to the Internet over your cellular network. Later, press &lt;Ctrl-C&gt; to disconnect. One is given to understand that the &quot;usb-modeswitch&quot; package may be necessary if your USB modem has not been used before. The writer has neither met nor tested the circumstance in question. To state the obvious: the procedure should be expected to work only if you have paid a subscription to the cellular network. It is not asserted that the procedure were the smoothest possible, but the procedure does have the virtue of being relatively obvious in its operation. Refinements may occur to the interested user. FAQ How do I enable &quot;Internet Connection Sharing&quot; ? A) Since the 2.6 kernel is main stream etc. I will only cover IPTables and Kernel 2.6. I am also assuming that ppp0 is your dialup and eth0 is your lan. Firstly - we need to add some rules to iptables - run the following commands: #This will CLEAR ALL RULES !!! iptables -F #Enable NAT (through the ppp0 interface) iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ppp0 -j MASQUERADE #then we need to enable routing: echo &quot;1&quot; &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward That should do it - from here you can add rules to block incomming connections etc. My card is broken/replies &quot;ERROR&quot; to all the commands A) You didn't send your PIN to the card - either add the &quot;pin&quot; command or disable the PIN on the SIM My Novatel card is very slow - +-800 bytes per second A) Try running &quot;setserial -a /dev/ttyS1 low_latency spd_warp&quot; - replace /dev/ttyS1 with your port Once you have your setserial command, insert it into /etc/ppp/ip-up.local - this will cause the command to be ran everytime a connection is made. What does all the wvdial sections do/mean ? Defaults - What to do if nothing is selected (Always included) pin - send your pin to the card novatel - select the novatel card option - select the option card hsdpa - Option HSDPA card e1000 - select the E1000 via USB onboard - select the onboard modem of my notebook internet - select the internet APN internetvpn - select the internetvpn APN myapn - select your apn 384k,144k,64k - select the speed of your 3G connection 2gonly - select GPRS only 3gonly - select 3G only How do I see the usage under Linux ?

Internet Protocols and Support » 20.6. urllib2 — extensible library for opening URLs¶ Note The urllib2 module has been split across several modules in Python 3 named urllib.request and urllib.error. The 2to3 tool will automatically adapt imports when converting your sources to Python 3. The urllib2 module defines functions and classes which help in opening URLs (mostly HTTP) in a complex world — basic and digest authentication, redirections, cookies and more. See also The Requests package is recommended for a higher-level HTTP client interface. The urllib2 module defines the following functions: urllib2.urlopen(url[, data[, timeout[, cafile[, capath[, cadefault[, context]]]]])¶ Open the URL url, which can be either a string or a Request object. data may be a string specifying additional data to send to the server, or None if no such data is needed. Currently HTTP requests are the only ones that use data; the HTTP request will be a POST instead of a GET when the data parameter is provided. data should be a buffer in the standard application/x-www-form-urlencoded format. The urllib.urlencode() function takes a mapping or sequence of 2-tuples and returns a string in this format. urllib2 module sends HTTP/1.1 requests with Connection:close header included. The optional timeout parameter specifies a timeout in seconds for blocking operations like the connection attempt (if not specified, the global default timeout setting will be used). This actually only works for HTTP, HTTPS and FTP connections. If context is specified, it must be a ssl.SSLContext instance describing the various SSL options. See HTTPSConnection for more details. The optional cafile and capath parameters specify a set of trusted CA certificates for HTTPS requests. cafile should point to a single file containing a bundle of CA certificates, whereas capath should point to a directory of hashed certificate files. More information can be found in ssl.SSLContext.load_verify_locations(). The cadefault parameter is ignored. This function returns a file-like object with three additional methods: geturl() — return the URL of the resource retrieved, commonly used to determine if a redirect was followed info() — return the meta-information of the page, such as headers, in the form of an mimetools.Message instance (see Quick Reference to HTTP Headers) getcode() — return the HTTP status code of the response. Raises URLError on errors. Note that None may be returned if no handler handles the request (though the default installed global OpenerDirector uses UnknownHandler to ensure this never happens). In addition, if proxy settings are detected (for example, when a *_proxy environment variable like http_proxy is set), ProxyHandler is default installed and makes sure the requests are handled through the proxy. Changed in version 2.6: timeout was added. Changed in version 2.7.9: cafile, capath, cadefault, and context were added. urllib2.install_opener(opener)¶ Install an OpenerDirector instance as the default global opener. Installing an opener is only necessary if you want urlopen to use that opener; otherwise, simply call OpenerDirector.open() instead of urlopen(). The code does not check for a real OpenerDirector, and any class with the appropriate interface will work. urllib2.build_opener([handler, ...])¶ Return an OpenerDirector instance, which chains the handlers in the order given. handlers can be either instances of BaseHandler, or subclasses of BaseHandler (in which case it must be possible to call the constructor without any parameters). Instances of the following classes will be in front of the handlers, unless the handlers contain them, instances of them or subclasses of them: ProxyHandler (if proxy settings are detected), UnknownHandler, HTTPHandler, HTTPDefaultErrorHandler, HTTPRedirectHandler, FTPHandler, FileHandler, HTTPErrorProcessor. If the Python installation has SSL support (i.e., if the ssl module can be imported), HTTPSHandler will also be added. Beginning in Python 2.3, a BaseHandler subclass may also change its handler_order attribute to modify its position in the handlers list. The following exceptions are raised as appropriate: exception urllib2.URLError¶ The handlers raise this exception (or derived exceptions) when they run into a problem. It is a subclass of IOError. reason¶ The reason for this error. It can be a message string or another exception instance (socket.error for remote URLs, OSError for local URLs). exception urllib2.HTTPError¶ Though being an exception (a subclass of URLError), an HTTPError can also function as a non-exceptional file-like return value (the same thing that urlopen() returns). This is useful when handling exotic HTTP errors, such as requests for authentication. code¶ An HTTP status code as defined in RFC 2616. This numeric value corresponds to a value found in the dictionary of codes as found in BaseHTTPServer.BaseHTTPRequestHandler.responses. reason¶ The reason for this error. It can be a message string or another exception instance. The following classes are provided: class urllib2.Request(url[, data][, headers][, origin_req_host][, unverifiable])¶ This class is an abstraction of a URL request. url should be a string containing a valid URL. data may be a string specifying additional data to send to the server, or None if no such data is needed. Currently HTTP requests are the only ones that use data; the HTTP request will be a POST instead of a GET when the data parameter is provided. data should be a buffer in the standard application/x-www-form-urlencoded format. The urllib.urlencode() function takes a mapping or sequence of 2-tuples and returns a string in this format. headers should be a dictionary, and will be treated as if add_header() was called with each key and value as arguments. This is often used to “spoof” the User-Agent header value, which is used by a browser to identify itself – some HTTP servers only allow requests coming from common browsers as opposed to scripts. For example, Mozilla Firefox may identify itself as &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686) Gecko/20071127 Firefox/2.0.0.11&quot;, while urllib2‘s default user agent string is &quot;Python-urllib/2.6&quot; (on Python 2.6). The final two arguments are only of interest for correct handling of third-party HTTP cookies: origin_req_host should be the request-host of the origin transaction, as defined by RFC 2965. It defaults to cookielib.request_host(self). This is the host name or IP address of the original request that was initiated by the user. For example, if the request is for an image in an HTML document, this should be the request-host of the request for the page containing the image. unverifiable should indicate whether the request is unverifiable, as defined by RFC 2965. It defaults to False. An unverifiable request is one whose URL the user did not have the option to approve. For example, if the request is for an image in an HTML document, and the user had no option to approve the automatic fetching of the image, this should be true. class urllib2.OpenerDirector¶ The OpenerDirector class opens URLs via BaseHandlers chained together. It manages the chaining of handlers, and recovery from errors. class urllib2.BaseHandler¶ This is the base class for all registered handlers — and handles only the simple mechanics of registration. class urllib2.HTTPDefaultErrorHandler¶ A class which defines a default handler for HTTP error responses; all responses are turned into HTTPError exceptions. class urllib2.HTTPRedirectHandler¶ A class to handle redirections. class urllib2.HTTPCookieProcessor([cookiejar])¶ A class to handle HTTP Cookies. class urllib2.ProxyHandler([proxies])¶ Cause requests to go through a proxy. If proxies is given, it must be a dictionary mapping protocol names to URLs of proxies. The default is to read the list of proxies from the environment variables &lt;protocol&gt;_proxy. If no proxy environment variables are set, then in a Windows environment proxy settings are obtained from the registry’s Internet Settings section, and in a Mac OS X environment proxy information is retrieved from the OS X System Configuration Framework. To disable autodetected proxy pass an empty dictionary. class urllib2.HTTPPasswordMgr¶ Keep a database of (realm, uri) -&gt; (user, password) mappings. class urllib2.HTTPPasswordMgrWithDefaultRealm¶ Keep a database of (realm, uri) -&gt; (user, password) mappings. A realm of None is considered a catch-all realm, which is searched if no other realm fits. class urllib2.AbstractBasicAuthHandler([password_mgr])¶ This is a mixin class that helps with HTTP authentication, both to the remote host and to a proxy. password_mgr, if given, should be something that is compatible with HTTPPasswordMgr; refer to section HTTPPasswordMgr Objects for information on the interface that must be supported. class urllib2.HTTPBasicAuthHandler([password_mgr])¶ Handle authentication with the remote host. password_mgr, if given, should be something that is compatible with HTTPPasswordMgr; refer to section HTTPPasswordMgr Objects for information on the interface that must be supported. class urllib2.ProxyBasicAuthHandler([password_mgr])¶ Handle authentication with the proxy. password_mgr, if given, should be something that is compatible with HTTPPasswordMgr; refer to section HTTPPasswordMgr Objects for information on the interface that must be supported. class urllib2.AbstractDigestAuthHandler([password_mgr])¶ This is a mixin class that helps with HTTP authentication, both to the remote host and to a proxy. password_mgr, if given, should be something that is compatible with HTTPPasswordMgr; refer to section HTTPPasswordMgr Objects for information on the interface that must be supported. class urllib2.HTTPDigestAuthHandler([password_mgr])¶ Handle authentication with the remote host. password_mgr, if given, should be something that is compatible with HTTPPasswordMgr; refer to section HTTPPasswordMgr Objects for information on the interface that must be supported. class urllib2.ProxyDigestAuthHandler([password_mgr])¶ Handle authentication with the proxy. password_mgr, if given, should be something that is compatible with HTTPPasswordMgr; refer to section HTTPPasswordMgr Objects for information on the interface that must be supported. class urllib2.HTTPHandler¶ A class to handle opening of HTTP URLs. class urllib2.HTTPSHandler([debuglevel[, context]])¶ A class to handle opening of HTTPS URLs. context has the same meaning as for httplib.HTTPSConnection. Changed in version 2.7.9: context added. class urllib2.FileHandler¶ Open local files. class urllib2.FTPHandler¶ Open FTP URLs. class urllib2.CacheFTPHandler¶ Open FTP URLs, keeping a cache of open FTP connections to minimize delays. class urllib2.UnknownHandler¶ A catch-all class to handle unknown URLs. class urllib2.HTTPErrorProcessor¶ Process HTTP error responses. 20.6.1. Request Objects¶ The following methods describe all of Request‘s public interface, and so all must be overridden in subclasses. Request.add_data(data)¶ Set the Request data to data. This is ignored by all handlers except HTTP handlers — and there it should be a byte string, and will change the request to be POST rather than GET. Request.get_method()¶ Return a string indicating the HTTP request method. This is only meaningful for HTTP requests, and currently always returns 'GET' or 'POST'. Request.has_data()¶ Return whether the instance has a non-None data. Request.get_data()¶ Return the instance’s data. Request.add_header(key, val)¶ Add another header to the request. Headers are currently ignored by all handlers except HTTP handlers, where they are added to the list of headers sent to the server. Note that there cannot be more than one header with the same name, and later calls will overwrite previous calls in case the key collides. Currently, this is no loss of HTTP functionality, since all headers which have meaning when used more than once have a (header-specific) way of gaining the same functionality using only one header. Request.add_unredirected_header(key, header)¶ Add a header that will not be added to a redirected request. New in version 2.4. Request.has_header(header)¶ Return whether the instance has the named header (checks both regular and unredirected). New in version 2.4. Request.get_full_url()¶ Return the URL given in the constructor. Request.get_type()¶ Return the type of the URL — also known as the scheme. Request.get_host()¶ Return the host to which a connection will be made. Request.get_selector()¶ Return the selector — the part of the URL that is sent to the server. Request.get_header(header_name, default=None)¶ Return the value of the given header. If the header is not present, return the default value. Request.header_items()¶ Return a list of tuples (header_name, header_value) of the Request headers. Request.set_proxy(host, type)¶ Prepare the request by connecting to a proxy server. The host and type will replace those of the instance, and the instance’s selector will be the original URL given in the constructor. Request.get_origin_req_host()¶ Return the request-host of the origin transaction, as defined by RFC 2965. See the documentation for the Request constructor. Request.is_unverifiable()¶ Return whether the request is unverifiable, as defined by RFC 2965. See the documentation for the Request constructor. 20.6.2. OpenerDirector Objects¶ OpenerDirector instances have the following methods: OpenerDirector.add_handler(handler)¶ handler should be an instance of BaseHandler. The following methods are searched, and added to the possible chains (note that HTTP errors are a special case). protocol_open — signal that the handler knows how to open protocol URLs. http_error_type — signal that the handler knows how to handle HTTP errors with HTTP error code type. protocol_error — signal that the handler knows how to handle errors from (non-http) protocol. protocol_request — signal that the handler knows how to pre-process protocol requests. protocol_response — signal that the handler knows how to post-process protocol responses. OpenerDirector.open(url[, data][, timeout])¶ Open the given url (which can be a request object or a string), optionally passing the given data. Arguments, return values and exceptions raised are the same as those of urlopen() (which simply calls the open() method on the currently installed global OpenerDirector). The optional timeout parameter specifies a timeout in seconds for blocking operations like the connection attempt (if not specified, the global default timeout setting will be used). The timeout feature actually works only for HTTP, HTTPS and FTP connections). Changed in version 2.6: timeout was added. OpenerDirector.error(proto[, arg[, ...]])¶ Handle an error of the given protocol. This will call the registered error handlers for the given protocol with the given arguments (which are protocol specific). The HTTP protocol is a special case which uses the HTTP response code to determine the specific error handler; refer to the http_error_*() methods of the handler classes. Return values and exceptions raised are the same as those of urlopen(). OpenerDirector objects open URLs in three stages: The order in which these methods are called within each stage is determined by sorting the handler instances. Every handler with a method named like protocol_request has that method called to pre-process the request. Handlers with a method named like protocol_open are called to handle the request. This stage ends when a handler either returns a non-None value (ie. a response), or raises an exception (usually URLError). Exceptions are allowed to propagate. In fact, the above algorithm is first tried for methods named default_open(). If all such methods return None, the algorithm is repeated for methods named like protocol_open. If all such methods return None, the algorithm is repeated for methods named unknown_open(). Note that the implementation of these methods may involve calls of the parent OpenerDirector instance’s open() and error() methods. Every handler with a method named like protocol_response has that method called to post-process the response. 20.6.3. BaseHandler Objects¶ BaseHandler objects provide a couple of methods that are directly useful, and others that are meant to be used by derived classes. These are intended for direct use: BaseHandler.add_parent(director)¶ Add a director as parent. BaseHandler.close()¶ Remove any parents. The following attributes and methods should only be used by classes derived from BaseHandler. Note The convention has been adopted that subclasses defining protocol_request() or protocol_response() methods are named *Processor; all others are named *Handler. BaseHandler.parent¶ A valid OpenerDirector, which can be used to open using a different protocol, or handle errors. BaseHandler.default_open(req)¶ This method is not defined in BaseHandler, but subclasses should define it if they want to catch all URLs. This method, if implemented, will be called by the parent OpenerDirector. It should return a file-like object as described in the return value of the open() of OpenerDirector, or None. It should raise URLError, unless a truly exceptional thing happens (for example, MemoryError should not be mapped to URLError). This method will be called before any protocol-specific open method. BaseHandler.protocol_open(req) (“protocol” is to be replaced by the protocol name.) This method is not defined in BaseHandler, but subclasses should define it if they want to handle URLs with the given protocol. This method, if defined, will be called by the parent OpenerDirector. Return values should be the same as for default_open(). BaseHandler.unknown_open(req)¶ This method is not defined in BaseHandler, but subclasses should define it if they want to catch all URLs with no specific registered handler to open it. This method, if implemented, will be called by the parent OpenerDirector. Return values should be the same as for default_open(). BaseHandler.http_error_default(req, fp, code, msg, hdrs)¶ This method is not defined in BaseHandler, but subclasses should override it if they intend to provide a catch-all for otherwise unhandled HTTP errors. It will be called automatically by the OpenerDirector getting the error, and should not normally be called in other circumstances. req will be a Request object, fp will be a file-like object with the HTTP error body, code will be the three-digit code of the error, msg will be the user-visible explanation of the code and hdrs will be a mapping object with the headers of the error. Return values and exceptions raised should be the same as those of urlopen(). BaseHandler.http_error_nnn(req, fp, code, msg, hdrs)¶ nnn should be a three-digit HTTP error code. This method is also not defined in BaseHandler, but will be called, if it exists, on an instance of a subclass, when an HTTP error with code nnn occurs. Subclasses should override this method to handle specific HTTP errors. Arguments, return values and exceptions raised should be the same as for http_error_default(). BaseHandler.protocol_request(req) (“protocol” is to be replaced by the protocol name.) This method is not defined in BaseHandler, but subclasses should define it if they want to pre-process requests of the given protocol. This method, if defined, will be called by the parent OpenerDirector. req will be a Request object. The return value should be a Request object. BaseHandler.protocol_response(req, response) (“protocol” is to be replaced by the protocol name.) This method is not defined in BaseHandler, but subclasses should define it if they want to post-process responses of the given protocol. This method, if defined, will be called by the parent OpenerDirector. req will be a Request object. response will be an object implementing the same interface as the return value of urlopen(). The return value should implement the same interface as the return value of urlopen(). 20.6.4. HTTPRedirectHandler Objects¶ Note Some HTTP redirections require action from this module’s client code. If this is the case, HTTPError is raised. See RFC 2616 for details of the precise meanings of the various redirection codes. HTTPRedirectHandler.redirect_request(req, fp, code, msg, hdrs, newurl)¶ Return a Request or None in response to a redirect. This is called by the default implementations of the http_error_30*() methods when a redirection is received from the server. If a redirection should take place, return a new Request to allow http_error_30*() to perform the redirect to newurl. Otherwise, raise HTTPError if no other handler should try to handle this URL, or return None if you can’t but another handler might. Note The default implementation of this method does not strictly follow RFC 2616, which says that 301 and 302 responses to POST requests must not be automatically redirected without confirmation by the user. In reality, browsers do allow automatic redirection of these responses, changing the POST to a GET, and the default implementation reproduces this behavior. HTTPRedirectHandler.http_error_301(req, fp, code, msg, hdrs)¶ Redirect to the Location: or URI: URL. This method is called by the parent OpenerDirector when getting an HTTP ‘moved permanently’ response. HTTPRedirectHandler.http_error_302(req, fp, code, msg, hdrs)¶ The same as http_error_301(), but called for the ‘found’ response. HTTPRedirectHandler.http_error_303(req, fp, code, msg, hdrs)¶ The same as http_error_301(), but called for the ‘see other’ response. HTTPRedirectHandler.http_error_307(req, fp, code, msg, hdrs)¶ The same as http_error_301(), but called for the ‘temporary redirect’ response. 20.6.5. HTTPCookieProcessor Objects¶ New in version 2.4. HTTPCookieProcessor instances have one attribute: HTTPCookieProcessor.cookiejar¶ The cookielib.CookieJar in which cookies are stored. 20.6.6. ProxyHandler Objects¶ ProxyHandler.protocol_open(request) (“protocol” is to be replaced by the protocol name.) The ProxyHandler will have a method protocol_open for every protocol which has a proxy in the proxies dictionary given in the constructor. The method will modify requests to go through the proxy, by calling request.set_proxy(), and call the next handler in the chain to actually execute the protocol. 20.6.7. HTTPPasswordMgr Objects¶ These methods are available on HTTPPasswordMgr and HTTPPasswordMgrWithDefaultRealm objects. HTTPPasswordMgr.add_password(realm, uri, user, passwd)¶ uri can be either a single URI, or a sequence of URIs. realm, user and passwd must be strings. This causes (user, passwd) to be used as authentication tokens when authentication for realm and a super-URI of any of the given URIs is given. HTTPPasswordMgr.find_user_password(realm, authuri)¶ Get user/password for given realm and URI, if any. This method will return (None, None) if there is no matching user/password. For HTTPPasswordMgrWithDefaultRealm objects, the realm None will be searched if the given realm has no matching user/password. 20.6.8. AbstractBasicAuthHandler Objects¶ AbstractBasicAuthHandler.http_error_auth_reqed(authreq, host, req, headers)¶ Handle an authentication request by getting a user/password pair, and re-trying the request. authreq should be the name of the header where the information about the realm is included in the request, host specifies the URL and path to authenticate for, req should be the (failed) Request object, and headers should be the error headers. host is either an authority (e.g. &quot;python.org&quot;) or a URL containing an authority component (e.g. &quot;http://python.org/&quot;). In either case, the authority must not contain a userinfo component (so, &quot;python.org&quot; and &quot;python.org:80&quot; are fine, &quot;joe:password@python.org&quot; is not). 20.6.9. HTTPBasicAuthHandler Objects¶ HTTPBasicAuthHandler.http_error_401(req, fp, code, msg, hdrs)¶ Retry the request with authentication information, if available. 20.6.10. ProxyBasicAuthHandler Objects¶ ProxyBasicAuthHandler.http_error_407(req, fp, code, msg, hdrs)¶ Retry the request with authentication information, if available. 20.6.11. AbstractDigestAuthHandler Objects¶ AbstractDigestAuthHandler.http_error_auth_reqed(authreq, host, req, headers)¶ authreq should be the name of the header where the information about the realm is included in the request, host should be the host to authenticate to, req should be the (failed) Request object, and headers should be the error headers. 20.6.12. HTTPDigestAuthHandler Objects¶ HTTPDigestAuthHandler.http_error_401(req, fp, code, msg, hdrs)¶ Retry the request with authentication information, if available. 20.6.13. ProxyDigestAuthHandler Objects¶ ProxyDigestAuthHandler.http_error_407(req, fp, code, msg, hdrs)¶ Retry the request with authentication information, if available. 20.6.14. HTTPHandler Objects¶ HTTPHandler.http_open(req)¶ Send an HTTP request, which can be either GET or POST, depending on req.has_data(). 20.6.15. HTTPSHandler Objects¶ HTTPSHandler.https_open(req)¶ Send an HTTPS request, which can be either GET or POST, depending on req.has_data(). 20.6.16. FileHandler Objects¶ FileHandler.file_open(req)¶ Open the file locally, if there is no host name, or the host name is 'localhost'. Change the protocol to ftp otherwise, and retry opening it using parent. 20.6.17. FTPHandler Objects¶ FTPHandler.ftp_open(req)¶ Open the FTP file indicated by req. The login is always done with empty username and password. 20.6.18. CacheFTPHandler Objects¶ CacheFTPHandler objects are FTPHandler objects with the following additional methods: CacheFTPHandler.setTimeout(t)¶ Set timeout of connections to t seconds. CacheFTPHandler.setMaxConns(m)¶ Set maximum number of cached connections to m. 20.6.19. UnknownHandler Objects¶ UnknownHandler.unknown_open()¶ Raise a URLError exception. 20.6.20. HTTPErrorProcessor Objects¶ New in version 2.4. HTTPErrorProcessor.http_response()¶ Process HTTP error responses. For 200 error codes, the response object is returned immediately. For non-200 error codes, this simply passes the job on to the protocol_error_code handler methods, via OpenerDirector.error(). Eventually, urllib2.HTTPDefaultErrorHandler will raise an HTTPError if no other handler handles the error. HTTPErrorProcessor.https_response()¶ Process HTTPS error responses. The behavior is same as http_response(). 20.6.21. Examples¶ In addition to the examples below, more examples are given in HOWTO Fetch Internet Resources Using urllib2. This example gets the python.org main page and displays the first 100 bytes of it: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; import urllib2 &gt;&gt;&gt; f = urllib2.urlopen('http://www.python.org/') &gt;&gt;&gt; print f.read(100) &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt; &lt;?xml-stylesheet href=&quot;./css/ht2html Here we are sending a data-stream to the stdin of a CGI and reading the data it returns to us. Note that this example will only work when the Python installation supports SSL. &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; import urllib2 &gt;&gt;&gt; req = urllib2.Request(url='https://localhost/cgi-bin/test.cgi', ... data='This data is passed to stdin of the CGI') &gt;&gt;&gt; f = urllib2.urlopen(req) &gt;&gt;&gt; print f.read() Got Data: &quot;This data is passed to stdin of the CGI&quot; The code for the sample CGI used in the above example is: #!/usr/bin/env python import sys data = sys.stdin.read() print 'Content-type: text-plain\n\nGot Data: &quot;%s&quot;' % data Use of Basic HTTP Authentication: import urllib2 # Create an OpenerDirector with support for Basic HTTP Authentication... auth_handler = urllib2.HTTPBasicAuthHandler() auth_handler.add_password(realm='PDQ Application', uri='https://mahler:8092/site-updates.py', user='klem', passwd='kadidd!ehopper') opener = urllib2.build_opener(auth_handler) # ...and install it globally so it can be used with urlopen. urllib2.install_opener(opener) urllib2.urlopen('http://www.example.com/login.html') build_opener() provides many handlers by default, including a ProxyHandler. By default, ProxyHandler uses the environment variables named &lt;scheme&gt;_proxy, where &lt;scheme&gt; is the URL scheme involved. For example, the http_proxy environment variable is read to obtain the HTTP proxy’s URL. This example replaces the default ProxyHandler with one that uses programmatically-supplied proxy URLs, and adds proxy authorization support with ProxyBasicAuthHandler. proxy_handler = urllib2.ProxyHandler({'http': 'http://www.example.com:3128/'}) proxy_auth_handler = urllib2.ProxyBasicAuthHandler() proxy_auth_handler.add_password('realm', 'host', 'username', 'password') opener = urllib2.build_opener(proxy_handler, proxy_auth_handler) # This time, rather than install the OpenerDirector, we use it directly: opener.open('http://www.example.com/login.html') Adding HTTP headers: Use the headers argument to the Request constructor, or: import urllib2 req = urllib2.Request('http://www.example.com/') req.add_header('Referer', 'http://www.python.org/') # Customize the default User-Agent header value: req.add_header('User-Agent', 'urllib-example/0.1 (Contact: . . .)') r = urllib2.urlopen(req) OpenerDirector automatically adds a User-Agent header to every Request. To change this: import urllib2 opener = urllib2.build_opener() opener.addheaders = [('User-agent', 'Mozilla/5.0')] opener.open('http://www.example.com/') Also, remember that a few standard headers (Content-Length, Content-Type and Host) are added when the Request is passed to urlopen() (or OpenerDirector.open()).

But, as other creative urban gardeners and nature lovers have shown, even the smallest of spaces can be turned in a tiny oasis. If all you have is a fire escape, hang up a few bird feeders and you'll have a flurry of feathered visitors in no time. In this simple how-to, we show you how to create a fun, recycled feeder that you can hang from your fire escape or windowsill. It costs next to nothing and anyone can do it—all you need to do is dig through your recycling bin and follow these 8 easy steps! Birdfeeder, How-to, Window, Upcycle, Recycled, Peanut Butter Jar, Urban, DIY, Fire Escape Step One: Gather the materials Gather the materials you’ll need to create your recycled bird feeder. We used: A recycled clean plastic peanut-butter jar with a screw-on lid (any size will do) Lid from a large plastic yogurt container Dremel (you can also use a small electric drill or make do with a Swiss Army Knife, nail, or utility knife) Washer or nut Sturdy string or twine Scissors Birdseed Gorilla Glue or similar strong glue Stick (you could use a bamboo skewer or even a long pencil). Birdfeeder, How-to, Window, Upcycle, Recycled, Peanut Butter Jar, Urban, DIY, Fire Escape Step Two: Drill Holes for the String Drill a small hole in the middle of the yogurt lid, the jar and the jar lid. The hole needs only be big enough to fit the string. Birdfeeder, How-to, Window, Upcycle, Recycled, Peanut Butter Jar, Urban, DIY, Fire Escape Step Three: Cut Feeding Holes Next, make holes for the birds to feed through. Sketch out 3-4 holes with a marker before you begin cutting – make each hole slightly bigger than a half-dollar. Carefully cut out the holes with a utility knife and discard the plastic pieces you cut out. Birdfeeder, How-to, Window, Upcycle, Recycled, Peanut Butter Jar, Urban, DIY, Fire Escape Step Four: Create a perch Using a marker and ruler, mark off two spots exactly opposite from each other slightly below your feeding holes. This is where you will thread through your stick, or feeding perch. Use your drill to make two holes that are sized correctly for the circumference of the stick you are using.

Calculate My Savings! Birdfeeder, How-to, Window, Upcycle, Recycled, Peanut Butter Jar, Urban, DIY, Fire Escape Step Five: String together your birdfeeder Approximate a length of string that is adequate to pass through your birdfeeder with an additional 6-8 inches for hanging, then double it by folding, and then cut your doubled length of string. Folding your piece of string in half, tie the washer or nut to the bottom. Thread the folded end of your string through your birdfeeder, beginning with the yogurt lid, then go through the jar, and finally pull the string through the jar lid. Birdfeeder, How-to, Window, Upcycle, Recycled, Peanut Butter Jar, Urban, DIY, Fire Escape Step Six: Attach Base and Perch Pull the string taut and place the lid on the peanut butter jar. Carefully glue the bottom of the jar to the yogurt lid. Next, thread the perch through the two holes you created and add a dab of the glue to each hole. Let the glue dry for an hour. Birdfeeder, How-to, Window, Upcycle, Recycled, Peanut Butter Jar, Urban, DIY, Fire Escape Step Seven: Add food to your birdfeeder Unscrew the lid and add the birdseed of your choice. As you see here, we used storebought birdseed mixed with peanut butter. Since we knew we were going to be hanging the birdfeeder on a fire escape, we used peanut butter to keep birdseed from falling into the shared yard below our window. If you aren’t worried about seeds scattering, you can fill it will plain birdseed and the yogurt lid will catch most of the extra seeds. Birdfeeder, How-to, Window, Upcycle, Recycled, Peanut Butter Jar, Urban, DIY, Fire Escape Step Eight: Hang it Up! Screw on the peanut butter jar lid, hang up your new recycled bird feeder, and wait for your new feathered friends to stop by for a snack! We tried hanging our bird feeder in a few different locations: here, outside our window hanging from the fire escape above. We also tested the feeder on the fire escape outside our window. We finally decided on hanging the feeder outside our window so we could see the birds when they come to visit. We used an over-the-door coat hook on the top of our window to hold the feeder.

How to Design Vertical Gardens for Tiny Spaces Design 03/05/2014 under carousel showcase, Design, DIY, Features, Gardening and Plants, Innovation, Recycled Materials by Catherine Winter-Hebert 4 Comments by Catherine Winter-Hebert View Slideshow If you’re one of the many people in the northern hemisphere who are counting down the days ’til springtime, chances are you may have also been daydreaming about gardening as well. March isn’t just one of the coldest months of the year—it’s also the month in which seed catalogs are sent out to green-thumbed folks everywhere, so plans can be made and plots can be mapped out in preparation for the luscious growing season ahead. If you happen to be lacking in yard space, there’s no need to feel left out! There are some brilliant ways to take full advantage of small spaces, and the key is to plant vertically. Vertical garden, urban gardening, vertical gardening, climbing plants, climbing food plants, edible climbersImage via Shutterstock Grow Up! As with any type of garden-planning, the very first thing you have to do is observe your space, so plan to spend a full day documenting your garden-to-be with a combination of photography and note-taking. Aim to wake a little before dawn so you can determine the first spot that gets early morning sunshine, and then take pictures every 30 minutes until the sun sets. This will allow you to determine the areas that get the most sunlight for the longest period of time and which remain shaded, so you can ensure that the light-gobbling plants get plenty of sunshine, and the shade lovers don’t get sunburned. When it comes to assembling a vertical garden, you don’t have to go out and spend a crazy amount of money on the latest, coolest gadgets and gardening systems. Some of the most incredible green spaces are those that have been put together from found/up-cycled materials, and a trip around the neighborhood on recycling day may yield just the equipment that you need. Vertical garden, urban gardening, vertical gardening, pallet, pallet garden, pallet gardeningImage via Shutterstock Pallets &amp; Pockets These are ideal for growing various types of greens (lettuce, spinach, kale, etc.), herbs, and edible flowers. The key with these is to take advantage of sunny spots like the side of a building, the area alongside a fence, or the brightest part of your balcony/patio and maximize space and yield by cramming that entire space full of plants. Pallets are ideal for this, as they can be divided into separate compartments for different plant species, and they’re sturdy enough to protect your plants in case there are any summer storms or high winds. They’re also ridiculously cheap: you can probably even score some for free. Vertical garden, urban gardening, vertical gardening, shoe garden, shoe organizer garden, shoe holder planterImage © GardenWeb Have you ever seen one of those divided fabric shoe holders that can be hung in a closet or on the back of a door? Each of those little pockets can be stuffed with compost-rich soil and used to grow food plants. Imagine an entire fence decked out like that? Vertical garden, urban gardening, vertical gardening, gutter plants, lettuce, edible climbersImage via Shutterstock Gutters, Bottles &amp; Cans Gutters tend to get the short end of the stick as far as gardening is concerned, since the only time people seem to associate them with greenery is when they have to replace their rooftop gutters because trees are growing in them. You can actually grow a lot of food in gutters, whether you latch several of them to the side of a building, or hang sections of them one above the other on chains or durable rope. Just drill some holes into the bottom of each section for adequate drainage, add compost-rich potting soil, and tuck your plants into them. You do have to ensure that the plants you choose don’t require a lot of root space, so aim for assorted lettuces and mixed herbs rather than root vegetables. Vertical garden, urban gardening, vertical gardening, herbs, hanging planter, bottle herbsImage via Shutterstock You can also take full advantage of window ledges and balcony railings, and hang all manner of planters from them. In addition to hanging pop-bottle planters, you grow herbs in used water bottles, or punch drainage holes in aluminum cans and sling those around as well. As long as you leave enough space above and below your hanging containers so the other plants get adequate light, you can create an entire mosaic of food plants rising as high as you can reach. Vertical garden, urban gardening, vertical gardening, climbing plants, climbing tomatoes, edible climbersImage via Shutterstock Lattices, Webs &amp; Trellises If the best spot you have for growing food happens to be a sunny outdoor wall, you’re actually in luck: many plants love to climb, including pole beans, peas, tomatoes, nasturtiums, squashes, cucumbers, hops, and even melons. You can use just about anything to help coax your plants skyward, from sections of fence lattice to lengths of plastic mesh. I once used a broken futon frame for my beans, and that worked absolute wonders. Ultimately, you just need some sort of frame so the little tendril thingers that your plants use to climb with have something to cling to on their way up. Vertical garden, urban gardening, vertical gardening, climbing plants, climbing food plants, bamboo polesImage via Shutterstock These structures don’t just have to be propped up against a wall either: if you have a small patch of yard space, you can lash bamboo poles together for your veg to climb, create trellises from string and wooden frames, or even make a climbing bean/pea tipi from old broom handles. Be creative, use whatever you have on hand, and you’ll be amazed at just how much you can grow. View Comments (4) LEAVE A COMMENT You must be logged in to post a comment.

Those with yards can really dive into gardening this time of year clearing away leaves and winter debris, and starting seedlings for summer. If you live in the city, however, you might find yourself spending time indoors, but you don't have to. Even if you don't have a large outdoor space, you can still take advantage of the increasing daylight hours with these 7 creative gardening projects. gardening, urban, apartment, greenery, spring, decor, sprouting, seed bombs, guerrilla gardening, herbs, mason jars, alfalfa, terrariums, microgreens, DIY, propagating, succulents, potting soil ®Flickr/Yutaka Seki Cultivate a jar of sprouts Sprouts You know those delicious, crunchy, sometimes spicy little green strands you eat in sandwiches and salads? Sprouts are one of the easiest veggies you can grow in even the tiniest of spaces with absolutely no access to sunlight or outdoor space. All you really need is a large sanitized glass jar, a piece of cheesecloth, water, a handful of seeds, and a few days’ time. You can purchase or order sprouts online from seed supply companies or some health and natural food stores. Alfalfa sprouts are of the most common sprouts, and you can spice up your sprout mix by adding in some flavorful broccoli or radish sprouts as well. Make sure you buy seeds that are meant for sprouting and eating, since some garden seeds could be chemically treated. All you’ll do is soak the seeds overnight in the jar, add a rubber band to hold on the cheesecloth, then rinse and drain them twice per day until they’re ready to eat in 2-3 days. gardening, urban, apartment, greenery, spring, decor, sprouting, seed bombs, guerrilla gardening, herbs, mason jars, alfalfa, terrariums, microgreens, DIY, propagating, succulents, potting soil ®Flickr/Niall McNulty Propagate houseplants If you can’t garden outdoors, garden indoors instead. Spring is a great time to propagate your favorite houseplants, since the longer daylight hours stimulate their growth. You can snip a leaf, vine, or stem from many common houseplants and simply place it in a vase of water for a couple of weeks until you see roots beginning to form. Not only is this a great way to get new plants for free, it’s fun to trade cuttings with friends to diversify your collection. Once you see roots forming in the water, you can plant the cutting in a pot or dish filled with potting soil. Houseplants that are easy to propagate by snipping off a segment of vine include pothos vines, spider plants, monsteras, philodendrons, and African violets. Succulents are also easy. Simply snip off a section of a succulent that’s become “leggy” (the stem has become thin and long) and let it dry out for a day or two. Then place it in a vase of water and wait for roots to appear before planting it in a new dish. gardening, urban, apartment, greenery, spring, decor, sprouting, seed bombs, guerrilla gardening, herbs, mason jars, alfalfa, terrariums, microgreens, DIY, propagating, succulents, potting soil Grow veggies from cuttings If you don’t have the space to grow your own veggies in the city, you can still cultivate fresh shoots right in your own kitchen on a sunny windowsill. Next time you pick up spring onions, ginger, or carrots from the farmer’s market, don’t throw away the cuttings – you can use them again. Intrigued?

It doesn’t mean you can’t cultivate some greenery to make your space more cozy. Terrariums are a terrific indoor gardening option for those apartments that lack good natural light. Mosses, ferns, ground creepers, and vines thrive in a cool, dark, moist environment. Scavenge your recycling bin or curio shelf for a unique glass vessel to plant in, and then hit your local gardening store, nursery, or hardware store for a few simple ingredients, including potting soil, gravel, moss, and a few fern seedlings. Read more about how to choose plants that will thrive in your specific living conditions in our primer on terrariums. gardening, urban, apartment, greenery, spring, decor, sprouting, seed bombs, guerrilla gardening, herbs, mason jars, alfalfa, terrariums, microgreens, DIY, propagating, succulents, potting soil ®Flickr/Alice Henneman Build an indoor herb garden If you have a room that gets consistent direct, natural sunlight, you could actually grow your own edible herbs indoors, and spring is a great time to sprout the seedlings. Herbs like basil, mint, and parsley will thrive indoors. But even if you have good light, that doesn’t solve the problem of space; if you don’t have enough windowsills or tabletops to host a collection of of plant pots, we have a solution for that too! With a handful of mason jars, a few pieces of wood, and some metal hose clamps from the hardware store, you can actually create your own delightful wall-mounted herb garden this spring.

Did you know they’re actually not all that complicated to grow from scratch? Instead of dropping big bucks on a plastic packaged container of delicate microgreens at your local gourmet grocery, try growing them yourself. You’ll need seeds, some potting soil, and a flat shallow tray (a reused food container or a baking dish would be suitable). You’ll want to source edible, non-chemically treated salad seeds – some fun greens to grow include arugula, tatsoi, mustard greens, radishes, and lettuces. You can shop online or via seed and gardening catalogs. The difference between sprouts and microgreens is that the latter are ready to snip and eat once they’ve leafed out and started to photosynthesize – thus, you’ll need to find a sunny windowsill for this project.

These funny looking marble-shaped objects are actually made from a variety of flower and plant seeds mixed with a binder (usually comprised of compost and clay) to keep it all together. You can toss, bury, or plant them anywhere you see a patch of dirt, including abandoned lots, sad and empty planter boxes, scraggly looking median strips, or the edges of parking lots. Whether you call it guerrilla gardening or tactical urbanism, with a little luck and a shower or two of rain, you could singlehandedly contribute to creating a green bright spot in an abandoned corner of your city.

Knot the ends. DIY, recycled, string, planter, succulent, interior, how-to, knotted, plants, decoration STEP 3: Start knotting Lay out the string on a flat surface and divide the 8 strings into 4 pairs. Knot each pair approximately 3 inches from the base. Take the two ends (left and right) and knot them as well to complete the circle. DIY, recycled, string, planter, succulent, interior, how-to, knotted, plants, decoration STEP 4: Keep knotting Keep creating a row of knots by repeating this step 2-4 inches above your first row of knot (depending on how wide your container is – wider containers will require a larger space). Do this by knotting together two strings from alternating rows so that your second row of knots consists of the opposite pair of strings (see picture). Remember to take the two spare ends and knot them together after each row to complete the circle. How much money can a solar roof save you in Kigali?

Start by adding a layer of sand and/or pebbles to the bottom of the container. This will promote healthy drainage for your plant since these containers do not have an open bottom. Cover the pebbles with a layer of potting soil and gently add your plant. DIY, recycled, string, planter, succulent, interior, how-to, knotted, plants, decoration STEP 7: Hang your planter Gently pull your new knotted string plant hanger up over your recycled container. The final step is knotting all 8 strands together at the top for hanging. Add a hook to hang from a window, shelf, or the ceiling. Variations: You can adapt this plant holder method as creatively as you like. Try a large plant container. Try a tiny plant container. Try a rock or other natural object.

Rosen April 16, 2015 Eighty percent of the people in Rwanda and TK percent in the DRC do not have electricity. It’s a Friday afternoon on the Rwandan side of Lake Kivu, and in what was once a quiet cove, a daring venture is taking shape. Floating just offshore, like a giant mechanical swan, is a nearly completed gas extraction platform: 3,000 tons of concrete and stainless steel that will soon begin capturing a resource not found at this scale in any other lake in the world. Dissolved within Kivu, which straddles the border of Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), are approximately 60 billion cubic meters of methane and 300 billion cubic meters of carbon dioxide. The gases, which come from nearby volcanic activity and bacteria decomposing organic material in the lake, represent both danger and economic potential. If extracted, Kivu’s methane could be used to add up to 960 megawatts of electricity-generating capacity, more than six times what Rwanda has now. For both Rwanda and the eastern DRC, which face crippling power shortages and limited options for expanding their electric grids, that could be an economic game changer, supporting new industries and offering a chance to alleviate searing poverty. If the extraction is done properly and the countries can coöperate, it could even help improve their troubled relations and advance stability in a region long beset by turmoil. A safety inspector examines the new barge on shore in Kibuye, Rwanda. Just as critical, removing Kivu’s methane may prevent a possible catastrophe. With methane concentrations rising, scientists warn that Kivu will eventually experience a deadly phenomenon known as an overturn. Also known as a limnic eruption, an overturn can occur if the pressure of the gases in a lake exceeds the pressure of the water at a given depth, causing a chain reaction that releases them with violent results. Only two limnic eruptions are known to have occurred in recorded history—both in small lakes in Cameroon in the 1980s. In the deadlier of the two episodes, at Lake Nyos in 1986, more than 1,700 people were asphyxiated when a cloud of carbon dioxide, which burst from the lake along with a 100-meter fountain of water,spread as far as 25 kilometers from shore. Kivu contains a thousand times more gas than Nyos: if even part of it escaped this way, more than two million people living near its shores would be at risk. In Kivu it’s the methane, rather than the carbon dioxide, that’s most likely to trigger a gas eruption. That adds urgency to the prospect of harnessing its energy potential, something both Rwanda and the DRC have long sought to do. After decades of little or no progress, gas extraction efforts in both countries have finally gained momentum. On my visit to the lake in February, more than a hundred orange-vested workers were putting the final touches on the first phase of KivuWatt, a $200 million project owned by the U.S. energy firm Contour Global. The lake’s first industrial-scale gas-fueled power project, it is expected to add 25 megawatts of generating capacity by the middle of this year and eventually scale up to 100. Another U.S. company, Symbion Power, is set to begin construction of a 50-megawatt project on the Rwandan side of the lake by the end of the year. In the DRC’s distant capital, Kinshasa, the Ministry of Hydrocarbons is now reviewing bids for that country’s first Kivu gas concession. Getting the gas out correctly, however, will be tricky. Although the Rwandan government has operated a pilot gas-fired power plant at the lake since 2008, the process of extraction is novel and has been done only on a very small scale. While most experts agree that the lake’s methane should be kept from accumulating further in order to prevent a disaster by the end of the century, a few warn that certain extraction processes could disturb the natural stratification that keeps the bulk of the gases trapped in deep waters. Undertaking them could increase, rather than mitigate, the risk of gas eruption. Until a large-scale extraction operation has commenced, it also remains unclear how efficiently the technology will function and how much electricity Kivu will ultimately yield. Get Flash Player “We are very curious to see how our process works,” says Jarmo Gummerus, a Finnish engineer and KivuWatt’s Rwanda country manager. “Very soon we’ll have a much better idea of the potential of this lake.” Boosting the grid Three hours by car over winding roads from KivuWatt, the Rwandan capital, Kigali, does not appear to be a city in the midst of an energy crisis. In the 21 years since the Rwandan genocide, in which an estimated 800,000 people were killed, the city of a million has transformed from a corpse-ridden backwater into a tidy modern metropolis. Today, Kigali is a town of smooth tree-lined streets, sprouting office towers and American-style subdivisions that stretch to the surrounding hills. It’s also the engine of a Rwandan economy that’s grown at an average of 8 percent per year over the last decade—one of the highest rates in the world. As Rwanda and its capital have developed, however, the country’s electricity grid has struggled to keep pace. Although installed capacity has doubled in the last five years, it remains a scant 156 megawatts. Today, nearly 80 percent of Rwanda’s 12 million people, including the vast majority of rural residents, still lack a connection to the grid. Families and business that do have power, meanwhile, face some of the highest electricity prices in the region—in part because nearly a third of the country’s power is generated from imported diesel and heavy fuel oil, which arrive by truck from Kenya and Tanzania. According to the World Bank, Rwandan companies pay an average of 24 cents per kilowatt-hour, compared with 15 cents in Kenya and 17 cents in Uganda. The average industrial user in the United States pays less than seven cents. Kivu, 1,460 meters above sea level, is part of a system of lakes along the Great Rift Valley. Hoping to reduce its widespread poverty and boost its small industrial base, Rwanda has set ambitious electrification targets. The country’s second Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy, launched in 2013, assumed a nearly fourfold expansion of the power grid, to 563 megawatts, by the end of 2017. Given financial constraints and limited domestic energy resources, however, this will be difficult to pull off. Aside from KivuWatt, the only significant power project nearing completion is a 15-megawatt plant that will burn peat. Although work has begun on another 80-megawatt peat facility, and financing is being arranged for two large-scale regional hydroelectric projects, it’s not clear if any will be on the grid by the 2017 target. Rwanda might also have significant geothermal resources, if preliminary surveys are correct, but two exploratory wells drilled in 2013 came up empty. And although Rwanda recently inaugurated East Africa’s first utility–scale solar field and authorities are working to bring off-grid solar installations to rural homes, schools, and hospitals, it’s unlikely that solar will be able to meet a significant portion of industry’s demands. Out of desperation, Rwanda could soon become a significant electricity importer. According to the Ministry of Infrastructure, arrangements are in the works to purchase 30 megawatts from Kenya this year and, eventually, up to 400 megawatts from Ethiopia. Across the border in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly known as Zaire), the power crisis is even more acute. The DRC, a country of 77 million people in a territory roughly the size of Western Europe, contains extensive hydroelectric resources. If fully tapped, the Congo River’s Inga Falls could yield an estimated 40,000 megawatts, nearly twice the capacity of the world’s largest power station, the Three Gorges Dam in China. Today, however, the DRC’s aging grid has an installed capacity of just 2,400 megawatts, roughly half of which is routinely unavailable because the transmission infrastructure is in such poor shape. In the war-torn east, power is particularly limited. Goma, the largest city on Lake Kivu, has an available capacity of less than five megawatts—a meager amount for a town of a million residents and a situation, some argue, that helps promote conflict. If boosting eastern Congo’s grid can spur the development of industries, says Bantu Lukambo, an environmental activist based in Goma, that would reduce the appeal of the region’s dozens of armed groups, which are magnets for youth with no other employment prospects. In addition, he says, more development could weaken the market for illicit charcoal, a trade that generates millions of dollars per year for local militias and leads to extensive deforestation. Gases from the lake will enter the gray stainless-steel tube to be separated. The volcanoes responsible for much of Kivu’s gas loom over Goma and its environs. In 2002, an eruption of Nyiragongo, a volcano located 20 kilometers north of town, destroyed a fifth of the city, leaving tens of thousands of people homeless and depositing lava that’s still being used as a building material. On a drive west from town, Mathieu Yalire, chief geochemist at the government-run Goma Volcano Observatory, shows me several depressions known to contain lethal seepages of carbon dioxide that are concentrated near the ground at the edges of past lava flows and occasionally asphyxiate children. At Kasinga Primary School in the town of Sake, 25 kilometers west of Goma, principal Batchoka Lubungo shows us a photo, displayed on the wall of his office, of a young victim. “One morning we found the boy dead over there,” he says, pointing to a known danger zone just outside his window. “We keep this picture here as a warning to the students.” The presence of mazuku is a reminder of Lake Kivu’s potential to sow disaster. But the carbon dioxide is not the only danger. The lake’s geochemistry is unusual, largely as a consequence of local subaquatic springs that absorb carbon dioxide from the region’s volcanic soil and feed the gas into Kivu’s deepest waters. Much of the methane comes from decomposing organic matter; the rest comes either from the volcanic soil or from bacteria converting the carbon dioxide to methane. Critically, these springs are saline, while the water sources feeding the lake’s upper layers are fresh. Since saline water is much denser than fresh water, this creates density gradients that prevent the gases from diffusing upward and into the atmosphere. Although this stratification is stable at present, the gas accumulation it makes possible has apparently led to limnic eruptions in the distant past. If nothing is done, it is likely to do so in the future. Still, much about this risk remains uncertain. Studies of Kivu’s sediment record suggest that the lake has experienced at least five overturns in the last 6,000 years. It’s not clear, however, whether these events involved all the lake’s layers of water, thus releasing all its gas, or just portions of its upper layers. In addition, though recent measurements have found that the concentration of methane is increasing—at a rate that could bring the gas close to saturation by the end of the century—it’s not yet known why this is happening or whether it will continue. Complicating matters, Kivu consists of five different basins of varying depths, each with distinct physiochemical properties. Top: Women dry tiny sambaza, or sardines. Bottom: A sign in Kibuye explains KivuWatt. It is clear, though, that an eruption in Kivu’s main basin could cause a disaster of apocalyptic proportions. If all the methane and carbon dioxide currently dissolved in Kivu were released into the atmosphere, they would cover the entire lake in a cloud of gas more than 100 meters thick. If even a small fraction of the gas were to get out, it could suffocate entire towns along the lake shore. This can happen if water at a given depth becomes fully saturated with gas and is lifted by a big earthquake, a volcanic eruption, or another external disturbance to a depth where the water pressure is not great enough to keep the gas dissolved. Extraction Whatever the extent of Kivu’s eruption risks, its methane has long been of commercial interest. From 1963 until 2006, Rwanda’s lakeside Bralirwa Brewery fueled its boilers with methane extracted 800 meters offshore. In the 1980s, researchers from the Netherlands tapped Bralirwa’s excess gas to fuel a fleet of cars, though the project eventually foundered. By the early 1990s, cross-border efforts to utilize the gas for electricity had begun to gain momentum, but progress was cut short by the Rwandan genocide and subsequent wars in eastern Congo. Eventually, with the return of stability in Rwanda, the government in Kigali entered into partnership with a Scottish firm to build a small pilot facility on the lake. The plant, known as KP1, began working intermittently in 2008 and produces a few megawatts of electricity. Another project briefly produced 2.4 megawatts in 2010, but the equipment was removed from the lake after it was damaged in a storm. KivuWatt is the country’s first attempt at large-scale gas extraction. Even though its technology is novel, the concept is relatively simple. A barge will be anchored to the lake bed 13 kilometers offshore, where four plastic pipes will draw up water from 350 meters below the surface. As the water rises, bubbles of methane and carbon dioxide will begin to form; eventually, roughly 80 percent of the methane and 40 percent of the carbon dioxide will be siphoned off inside a subsurface horizontal chamber known as a separator. From there, the partially degassed water will be reinjected deep into the lake, and the gas—at this point roughly 30 percent methane and 70 percent carbon dioxide,with trace amounts of hydrogen sulfide—will continue upward into one of four towers on the barge. Here, “wash water” taken from a depth of 40 meters will be mixed with the gas to remove as much of the remaining carbon dioxide as possible. This water will be returned to a depth of 60 meters, shallow enough for some of the carbon dioxide to eventually diffuse into the atmosphere. The end product, a gas composed of roughly 85 percent methane, will then be pressurized and sent to a power plant on shore. For a region in such dire need of electricity, Kivu’s gas is an attractive proposition. According to Gummerus, the engineer overseeing the project, KivuWatt will sell power generated in its first phase to Rwanda’s state-owned utility for less than 15 cents per kilowatt-hour. That’s competitive with the rates expected from the country’s forthcoming peat projects and less than half the cost of power generated from imported fossil fuels. (Later the rate is expected to fall to less than 12 cents per kilowatt-hour.) As desirable as the project seems for both economic and safety reasons, however, it could pose environmental risks of its own—including the chance that the degassing operations could change the structure and properties of the lake. Children of fishermen play around fishing boats off the shores of Gisenyi. According to the Management Prescriptions for the Development of Lake Kivu Gas Resources, a 2009 document—known as the MPs—that both Rwanda and the DRC have adopted as general guidelines for gas extraction, the risks have less to do with the removal of the gas itself than with the reinjection of the degassed water. Since Kivu’s methane-rich deep water is saline, dense, and abundant in nutrients, releasing it near the surface could damage the lake’s ecosystem and weaken its density stratification. To mitigate these risks, the report dictates that all water extracted from the lake’s deep-water “resource zone” be reinjected at least 260 meters below the surface so that it remains under enough pressure. Because KivuWatt’s design was approved before the report was released, however, the project isn’t subject to this requirement, and its degassed water will be returned above that level, at a depth of 240 meters. Although this distinction may seem trivial, Philip Morkel, a South African engineer and a member of the five-person expert committee that wrote the guidelines, believes otherwise. “Once you punch through those gradient layers, you start damaging the protective mechanism that the lake has to preserve itself,” he says. “On a large scale it becomes seriously problematic.” Some experts see less reason for alarm. Dario Tedesco, an Italian volcanologist with extensive knowledge of the lake, tells me the quantity of water reinjected is unlikely to be large enough to create a serious disturbance. Alfred Johny Wüest, head of the aquatic physics research group at the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology and another member of the MPs committee, says it erred on the side of caution, which means that even the water from KivuWatt will be reinjected deep enough for safety. Wüest has other concerns, however, including that the project could harm the lake’s ecology. That worries some fishermen, too. Fishing will be forbidden in an exclusion zone around KivuWatt, but even outside that area, the reinjection of wash water and the noise and vibrations from the extraction project could be noticeable. Fishermen near the KP1 pilot plant told me that their catches, mainly of sardines known as sambaza, have fallen significantly since the facility began to operate. It’s difficult to isolate the cause there, however, since a drop in sambaza numbers has been documented across the lake—a decline linked to a rise in unregulated boats and the introduction of a predator species. Workers attend to the final construction phase of the KivuWatt barge. A portrait of Rwanda’s president looms over controls in the KP1 pilot plant. The most pressing concern from an energy standpoint is how well the gas extraction technology will perform. The MPs’ authors estimate that the lake is capable of providing between 160 and 960 megawatts of generating capacity over a period of 50 years. After that, the gas that continues to accumulate could be harnessed for up to 100 megawatts of capacity in perpetuity. All of this, though, hinges on the efficiency of the extraction process and the onshore power conversion technology. KivuWatt should extract about two-thirds of the methane from the water it draws up, with the rest lost during the separation process and in the washing towers. Although some of that gas will be returned to the lake in the reinjected water and could theoretically be reëxtracted at a later date, it is likely to settle in smaller concentrations, which could make it uneconomical to capture. But these projections are based only on simulations, and the real efficiency won’t be known until the barge begins to operate. Essentially, the lake’s potential is still highly uncertain. Disappointing results could spur disputes between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Although the two countries signed an agreement in 1975 to share the methane equally, Rwanda’s head start in exploitation means it could potentially infringe upon its neighbor’s resource, particularly if the lake yields less power than expected. (Because gas levels in the lake’s main basin are uniform across a given depth, it’s impossible to extract from Rwandan waters without affecting the quantity available in the DRC.) The two countries do not exactly have an amicable history. Since the current Rwandan government seized power at the end of the genocide, Rwanda has twice launched rebellions to topple governments in Kinshasa—once successfully. It has also been implicated in the support of numerous proxy militias in the DRC’s east as well as the widespread smuggling of Congolese minerals, including gold, tin, and coltan, an ore mined for use in electronics manufacturing. In this context, some worry, Kivu’s gas may simply be another means by which Rwanda, a small yet highly organized state, manages to profit at the expense of its larger, dysfunctional neighbor. After the barge is completed, it will be towed 13 kilometers onto the lake to begin extracting gas. If the project is successful, though, it could help mend cross-border relations. The two countries, which already share power from a hydroelectric plant on their border south of Kivu, have long sought to implement a joint gas-to-power project, according to Augusta Umutoni, head of Rwanda’s Lake Kivu Monitoring Program, a government body that oversees the extraction process. Despite the vagaries of politics, she says, energy officials from the two countries collaborate well at a technical level. Both, however, are waiting until the concept has been shown to work on a commercial scale. With so many questions lingering as KivuWatt prepares for launch, it’s easy to forget that KP1, the pilot facility, is now in its eighth year of operation. Although the project, originally conceived to generate five megawatts, struggled to produce more than a single megawatt for years, it is now consistently generating between two and three—giving authorities a slight boost of confidence. On a February evening, I join Olivier Ntirushwa, KP1’s plant manager, on a tour of the barge, which floats a kilometer from shore, within sight of the Rwanda-DRC border. Looking north, I see the city of Goma and its erratic patchwork of lights. Further afield is the steaming cone of Nyiragongo. Over the noise of the barge’s machinery, Ntirushwa gives me a brief history of the project: how it operated well below capacity for years; how recent improvements to its separator finally boosted its power output. When I ask about his predictions for KivuWatt, Ntirushwa says he doesn’t know much about the project, or how much electricity the lake might eventually yield. Instead, he stresses how it feels to be involved in such a high-stakes experiment. “It’s exciting because we are the pioneers of this technology,” he says as we stare out over the water. “Nobody else has ever done this.” Jonathan W.

ConfigParser — Configuration file parser¶ Note The ConfigParser module has been renamed to configparser in Python 3. The 2to3 tool will automatically adapt imports when converting your sources to Python 3. This module defines the class ConfigParser. The ConfigParser class implements a basic configuration file parser language which provides a structure similar to what you would find on Microsoft Windows INI files. You can use this to write Python programs which can be customized by end users easily. Note This library does not interpret or write the value-type prefixes used in the Windows Registry extended version of INI syntax. See also Module shlex Support for a creating Unix shell-like mini-languages which can be used as an alternate format for application configuration files. Module json The json module implements a subset of JavaScript syntax which can also be used for this purpose. The configuration file consists of sections, led by a [section] header and followed by name: value entries, with continuations in the style of RFC 822 (see section 3.1.1, “LONG HEADER FIELDS”); name=value is also accepted. Note that leading whitespace is removed from values. The optional values can contain format strings which refer to other values in the same section, or values in a special DEFAULT section. Additional defaults can be provided on initialization and retrieval. Lines beginning with '#' or ';' are ignored and may be used to provide comments. Configuration files may include comments, prefixed by specific characters (# and ;). Comments may appear on their own in an otherwise empty line, or may be entered in lines holding values or section names. In the latter case, they need to be preceded by a whitespace character to be recognized as a comment. (For backwards compatibility, only ; starts an inline comment, while # does not.) On top of the core functionality, SafeConfigParser supports interpolation. This means values can contain format strings which refer to other values in the same section, or values in a special DEFAULT section. Additional defaults can be provided on initialization. For example: [My Section] foodir: %(dir)s/whatever dir=frob long: this value continues in the next line would resolve the %(dir)s to the value of dir (frob in this case). All reference expansions are done on demand. Default values can be specified by passing them into the ConfigParser constructor as a dictionary. Additional defaults may be passed into the get() method which will override all others. Sections are normally stored in a built-in dictionary. An alternative dictionary type can be passed to the ConfigParser constructor. For example, if a dictionary type is passed that sorts its keys, the sections will be sorted on write-back, as will be the keys within each section. class ConfigParser.RawConfigParser([defaults[, dict_type[, allow_no_value]]])¶ The basic configuration object. When defaults is given, it is initialized into the dictionary of intrinsic defaults. When dict_type is given, it will be used to create the dictionary objects for the list of sections, for the options within a section, and for the default values. When allow_no_value is true (default: False), options without values are accepted; the value presented for these is None. This class does not support the magical interpolation behavior. All option names are passed through the optionxform() method. Its default implementation converts option names to lower case. New in version 2.3. Changed in version 2.6: dict_type was added. Changed in version 2.7: The default dict_type is collections.OrderedDict. allow_no_value was added. class ConfigParser.ConfigParser([defaults[, dict_type[, allow_no_value]]])¶ Derived class of RawConfigParser that implements the magical interpolation feature and adds optional arguments to the get() and items() methods. The values in defaults must be appropriate for the %()s string interpolation. Note that __name__ is an intrinsic default; its value is the section name, and will override any value provided in defaults. All option names used in interpolation will be passed through the optionxform() method just like any other option name reference. Using the default implementation of optionxform(), the values foo %(bar)s and foo %(BAR)s are equivalent. New in version 2.3. Changed in version 2.6: dict_type was added. Changed in version 2.7: The default dict_type is collections.OrderedDict. allow_no_value was added. class ConfigParser.SafeConfigParser([defaults[, dict_type[, allow_no_value]]])¶ Derived class of ConfigParser that implements a more-sane variant of the magical interpolation feature. This implementation is more predictable as well. New applications should prefer this version if they don’t need to be compatible with older versions of Python. New in version 2.3. Changed in version 2.6: dict_type was added. Changed in version 2.7: The default dict_type is collections.OrderedDict. allow_no_value was added. exception ConfigParser.Error¶ Base class for all other configparser exceptions. exception ConfigParser.NoSectionError¶ Exception raised when a specified section is not found. exception ConfigParser.DuplicateSectionError¶ Exception raised if add_section() is called with the name of a section that is already present. exception ConfigParser.NoOptionError¶ Exception raised when a specified option is not found in the specified section. exception ConfigParser.InterpolationError¶ Base class for exceptions raised when problems occur performing string interpolation. exception ConfigParser.InterpolationDepthError¶ Exception raised when string interpolation cannot be completed because the number of iterations exceeds MAX_INTERPOLATION_DEPTH. Subclass of InterpolationError. exception ConfigParser.InterpolationMissingOptionError¶ Exception raised when an option referenced from a value does not exist. Subclass of InterpolationError. New in version 2.3. exception ConfigParser.InterpolationSyntaxError¶ Exception raised when the source text into which substitutions are made does not conform to the required syntax. Subclass of InterpolationError. New in version 2.3. exception ConfigParser.MissingSectionHeaderError¶ Exception raised when attempting to parse a file which has no section headers. exception ConfigParser.ParsingError¶ Exception raised when errors occur attempting to parse a file. ConfigParser.MAX_INTERPOLATION_DEPTH¶ The maximum depth for recursive interpolation for get() when the raw parameter is false. This is relevant only for the ConfigParser class. See also Module shlex Support for a creating Unix shell-like mini-languages which can be used as an alternate format for application configuration files. 13.2.1. RawConfigParser Objects¶ RawConfigParser instances have the following methods: RawConfigParser.defaults()¶ Return a dictionary containing the instance-wide defaults. RawConfigParser.sections()¶ Return a list of the sections available; DEFAULT is not included in the list. RawConfigParser.add_section(section)¶ Add a section named section to the instance. If a section by the given name already exists, DuplicateSectionError is raised. If the name DEFAULT (or any of it’s case-insensitive variants) is passed, ValueError is raised. RawConfigParser.has_section(section)¶ Indicates whether the named section is present in the configuration. The DEFAULT section is not acknowledged. RawConfigParser.options(section)¶ Returns a list of options available in the specified section. RawConfigParser.has_option(section, option)¶ If the given section exists, and contains the given option, return True; otherwise return False. New in version 1.6. RawConfigParser.read(filenames)¶ Attempt to read and parse a list of filenames, returning a list of filenames which were successfully parsed. If filenames is a string or Unicode string, it is treated as a single filename. If a file named in filenames cannot be opened, that file will be ignored. This is designed so that you can specify a list of potential configuration file locations (for example, the current directory, the user’s home directory, and some system-wide directory), and all existing configuration files in the list will be read. If none of the named files exist, the ConfigParser instance will contain an empty dataset. An application which requires initial values to be loaded from a file should load the required file or files using readfp() before calling read() for any optional files: import ConfigParser, os config = ConfigParser.ConfigParser() config.readfp(open('defaults.cfg')) config.read(['site.cfg', os.path.expanduser('~/.myapp.cfg')]) Changed in version 2.4: Returns list of successfully parsed filenames. RawConfigParser.readfp(fp[, filename])¶ Read and parse configuration data from the file or file-like object in fp (only the readline() method is used). If filename is omitted and fp has a name attribute, that is used for filename; the default is &lt;???&gt;. RawConfigParser.get(section, option)¶ Get an option value for the named section. RawConfigParser.getint(section, option)¶ A convenience method which coerces the option in the specified section to an integer. RawConfigParser.getfloat(section, option)¶ A convenience method which coerces the option in the specified section to a floating point number. RawConfigParser.getboolean(section, option)¶ A convenience method which coerces the option in the specified section to a Boolean value. Note that the accepted values for the option are &quot;1&quot;, &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;true&quot;, and &quot;on&quot;, which cause this method to return True, and &quot;0&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, &quot;false&quot;, and &quot;off&quot;, which cause it to return False. These string values are checked in a case-insensitive manner. Any other value will cause it to raise ValueError. RawConfigParser.items(section)¶ Return a list of (name, value) pairs for each option in the given section. RawConfigParser.set(section, option, value)¶ If the given section exists, set the given option to the specified value; otherwise raise NoSectionError. While it is possible to use RawConfigParser (or ConfigParser with raw parameters set to true) for internal storage of non-string values, full functionality (including interpolation and output to files) can only be achieved using string values. New in version 1.6. RawConfigParser.write(fileobject)¶ Write a representation of the configuration to the specified file object. This representation can be parsed by a future read() call. New in version 1.6. RawConfigParser.remove_option(section, option)¶ Remove the specified option from the specified section. If the section does not exist, raise NoSectionError. If the option existed to be removed, return True; otherwise return False. New in version 1.6. RawConfigParser.remove_section(section)¶ Remove the specified section from the configuration. If the section in fact existed, return True. Otherwise return False. RawConfigParser.optionxform(option)¶ Transforms the option name option as found in an input file or as passed in by client code to the form that should be used in the internal structures. The default implementation returns a lower-case version of option; subclasses may override this or client code can set an attribute of this name on instances to affect this behavior. You don’t necessarily need to subclass a ConfigParser to use this method, you can also re-set it on an instance, to a function that takes a string argument. Setting it to str, for example, would make option names case sensitive: cfgparser = ConfigParser() ... cfgparser.optionxform = str Note that when reading configuration files, whitespace around the option names are stripped before optionxform() is called. 13.2.2. ConfigParser Objects¶ The ConfigParser class extends some methods of the RawConfigParser interface, adding some optional arguments. ConfigParser.get(section, option[, raw[, vars]])¶ Get an option value for the named section. If vars is provided, it must be a dictionary. The option is looked up in vars (if provided), section, and in defaults in that order. All the '%' interpolations are expanded in the return values, unless the raw argument is true. Values for interpolation keys are looked up in the same manner as the option. ConfigParser.items(section[, raw[, vars]])¶ Return a list of (name, value) pairs for each option in the given section. Optional arguments have the same meaning as for the get() method. New in version 2.3. 13.2.3. SafeConfigParser Objects¶ The SafeConfigParser class implements the same extended interface as ConfigParser, with the following addition: SafeConfigParser.set(section, option, value)¶ If the given section exists, set the given option to the specified value; otherwise raise NoSectionError. value must be a string (str or unicode); if not, TypeError is raised. New in version 2.4. 13.2.4. Examples¶ An example of writing to a configuration file: import ConfigParser config = ConfigParser.RawConfigParser() # When adding sections or items, add them in the reverse order of # how you want them to be displayed in the actual file. # In addition, please note that using RawConfigParser's and the raw # mode of ConfigParser's respective set functions, you can assign # non-string values to keys internally, but will receive an error # when attempting to write to a file or when you get it in non-raw # mode. SafeConfigParser does not allow such assignments to take place. config.add_section('Section1') config.set('Section1', 'an_int', '15') config.set('Section1', 'a_bool', 'true') config.set('Section1', 'a_float', '3.1415') config.set('Section1', 'baz', 'fun') config.set('Section1', 'bar', 'Python') config.set('Section1', 'foo', '%(bar)s is %(baz)s!') # Writing our configuration file to 'example.cfg' with open('example.cfg', 'wb') as configfile: config.write(configfile) An example of reading the configuration file again: import ConfigParser config = ConfigParser.RawConfigParser() config.read('example.cfg') # getfloat() raises an exception if the value is not a float # getint() and getboolean() also do this for their respective types a_float = config.getfloat('Section1', 'a_float') an_int = config.getint('Section1', 'an_int') print a_float + an_int # Notice that the next output does not interpolate '%(bar)s' or '%(baz)s'. # This is because we are using a RawConfigParser(). if config.getboolean('Section1', 'a_bool'): print config.get('Section1', 'foo') To get interpolation, you will need to use a ConfigParser or SafeConfigParser: import ConfigParser config = ConfigParser.ConfigParser() config.read('example.cfg') # Set the third, optional argument of get to 1 if you wish to use raw mode. print config.get('Section1', 'foo', 0) # -&gt; &quot;Python is fun!&quot; print config.get('Section1', 'foo', 1) # -&gt; &quot;%(bar)s is %(baz)s!&quot; # The optional fourth argument is a dict with members that will take # precedence in interpolation. print config.get('Section1', 'foo', 0, {'bar': 'Documentation', 'baz': 'evil'}) Defaults are available in all three types of ConfigParsers. They are used in interpolation if an option used is not defined elsewhere. import ConfigParser # New instance with 'bar' and 'baz' defaulting to 'Life' and 'hard' each config = ConfigParser.SafeConfigParser({'bar': 'Life', 'baz': 'hard'}) config.read('example.cfg') print config.get('Section1', 'foo') # -&gt; &quot;Python is fun!&quot; config.remove_option('Section1', 'bar') config.remove_option('Section1', 'baz') print config.get('Section1', 'foo') # -&gt; &quot;Life is hard!&quot; The function opt_move below can be used to move options between sections: def opt_move(config, section1, section2, option): try: config.set(section2, option, config.get(section1, option, 1)) except ConfigParser.NoSectionError: # Create non-existent section config.add_section(section2) opt_move(config, section1, section2, option) else: config.remove_option(section1, option) Some configuration files are known to include settings without values, but which otherwise conform to the syntax supported by ConfigParser. The allow_no_value parameter to the constructor can be used to indicate that such values should be accepted: &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; import ConfigParser &gt;&gt;&gt; import io &gt;&gt;&gt; sample_config = &quot;&quot;&quot; ... [mysqld] ... user = mysql ... pid-file = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid ... skip-external-locking ... old_passwords = 1 ... skip-bdb ... skip-innodb ... &quot;&quot;&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt; config = ConfigParser.RawConfigParser(allow_no_value=True) &gt;&gt;&gt; config.readfp(io.BytesIO(sample_config)) &gt;&gt;&gt; # Settings with values are treated as before: &gt;&gt;&gt; config.get(&quot;mysqld&quot;, &quot;user&quot;) 'mysql' &gt;&gt;&gt; # Settings without values provide None: &gt;&gt;&gt; config.get(&quot;mysqld&quot;, &quot;skip-bdb&quot;) &gt;&gt;&gt; # Settings which aren't specified still raise an error: &gt;&gt;&gt; config.get(&quot;mysqld&quot;, &quot;does-not-exist&quot;) Traceback (most recent call last): ...

Comments Computerworld | Mar 16, 2014 4:21 PM PT Like this article? thumbsup 0 thumbsdown RELATED TOPICS Operating Systems Open Source Networking Linux Comments The days before home networks Once upon a time, there was something called a &quot;standalone Computer&quot; -- one that was used to perform some specific task and didn't require other devices or a network interface to do its job. It might have allowed its owner to write essays, play games, or manage family finances, but all data was stored and processed locally. And, if there was a printer involved, it was a &quot;slave&quot; printer -- one that hung off a port on the system and wasn't shared unless someone carried it to another computer. My first home computer was a standalone and my neighbors at the time thought I was some kind of freak just for having computer in my home, never mind having it sitting on a desk in the corner of my dining room. At the time, this identified me as being clearly abnormal, though I'd bet today these same people all have home computers and can't imagine going through life without them. Standalones may still exist today and their isolation may work to their advantage, but they are very rare. These days, nearly all computers are hooked to networks and are able to connect to systems around the globe. Unix/Linux systems are no exception. This kind of connectivity changes relationships between families, friends, and people with shared interests dramatically. I hear from my sister far more often than the 2,920 miles between us would allow if facebook and gmail didn't provide a way for us to share the fairly trivial news from our day-to-day lives. And I recently met a 5th cousin once removed on linkedin. That's fairly incredible and something I'd never have had the patience or the tools to pull off 20 years ago. Top 25 Windows 10 Free Tools Your step-by-step guide to repairing Windows 10 When Windows 10 gets wonky, there's a whole set of activities to try and set things right. If Read Now The scene today Instead of a standalone computer, today most people I know now have a home network. They have multiple computers connected to a private LAN, maybe a printer or two, and maybe even a large capacity network drive for backups. And some of those home networks include a mix of Windows and Linux systems. So, what do you need to know if one or more of those computers is a Linux system? What do you need to know if you're going to be setting up network connections on Linux systems at work? Setting up your network connection Whether at home or at work, if you're configuring a system to act as a Linux server, you will need to assign it what is called a &quot;static&quot; address. Static means it doesn't change. Server means that other systems need to find and connect to it. A static address is necessary so that clients, when they need to initiate connections, have a known address to use for these connections. For non-servers or &quot;client&quot; systems, addresses can be assigned dynamically and generally are -- whether they are assigned an address by a local router (as I have in my home) or by a DHCP server that manages this role within an organization. Even if your system is assigned an address dynamically, this doesn't mean that the address will change every time you boot it. Even DHCP addresses tends to be stable for a while. There is some likelihood that the same IP address will be assigned to a system for weeks, even months -- just no guarantee. As I like to tell my students, clients need to be able to find servers like shoppers need to find supermarkets. Servers never need to find their clients and supermarkets don't need to find their customers. Since clients initiate the connections, they can be coming from nearly anywhere. Examining your network interfaces To view your network settings, you would use the ifconfig command. If you try this command and get an error that claims the command cannot be found, it is likely that /sbin is not on your search path. You can try typing /sbin/ifconfig instead or you can modify your search path and then try ifconfig again. $ ifconfig -bash: ifconfig: command not found $ PATH=$PATH:/sbin $ ifconfig eth0 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr 00:16:35:69:BD:79 inet addr:192.168.0.11 Bcast:192.168.0.255 Mask:255.255.255.0 inet6 addr: fe80::212:ff35:fe69:bd12/64 Scope:Link UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST MTU:1500 Metric:1 RX packets:16791460 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0 TX packets:30066639 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0 collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 RX bytes:2182259898 (2.0 GiB) TX bytes:3951206845 (3.6 GiB) Interrupt:209 Memory:fdef0000-fdf00000 lo Link encap:Local Loopback inet addr:127.0.0.1 Mask:255.0.0.0 inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host UP LOOPBACK RUNNING MTU:16436 Metric:1 RX packets:32098 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0 TX packets:32098 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0 collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 RX bytes:3227365 (3.0 MiB) TX bytes:3227365 (3.0 MiB) Output like that shown above tells you a number of things. It tells you that the local network is a private network. You can tell this by the IP address shown in the second line. Any IP address that starts with 192.168 is part of a private address range. Many home networks will make use of a local router that assigns addresses like these to systems on the LAN as they boot. You can also tell, by looking at the 255.255.255.0 mask, that this network is capable of accommodating hundreds of systems, even if the router only provides eight ports. In today's typical home network, systems are likely to use wireless networking, so the number of available ports on the router isn't particularly significant. We can also see that the network interface is operational (RUNNING), view some numbers that tell us that data is going out and coming in (RX and TX packets), and note that a second network interface is listed. This second interface (i.e., the &quot;lo&quot; interface) is the &quot;loopback&quot;. This interface is used by the system to communicate with itself. You should always see a loopback interface in your ifconfig output and it should always have the address 127.0.0.1. This address isn't used for anything else. Where does your IP address come from? Most likely, your IP address for both your home systems and the one that may be sitting on your desk at work are assigned addresses dynamically. And most likely, those addresses fall into one of the address ranges that can only be used internally and can be used by anyone. Those address ranges are: &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Range Decimal values # of addresses&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255 167772160-184549375 16777216 172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255 2886729728-2887778303 1048576 192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255 3232235520-3232301055 65536 Most home networks use IP addresses in the 192.168.0.0/24 (i.e., the bottom line shown above) because so many of the small network routers available today are set up to assign these addresses. You might notice that the first address range shown up is the largest of the three. This address range includes more than 16 million addresses. For this reason, it's the network address range that many organizations use for their internal systems, though most will only use a small portion of the available addresses. The second range contains more than 1 million address and the third more than 65,000. Most organizations will, of course, only use a small subset of the addresses in whatever range they choose to use.

Durbin calls Abbott Labs' IT layoffs 'harsh and insensitive’ Networks big and small When organizations use the 10.0.0.0/8 (i.e., the top network range above), they generally break it into many smaller network segments to limit the amount of network traffic that traverses each segment, avoiding high collision rates (when &quot;packets&quot; interfere with each other) and network slowdowns. Other IP address ranges are public. This means that they can only be used by their registered &quot;owners&quot; and that they can be used to move data over the Internet. Private addresses can only be used inside private networks. Most organizations today use a private address range for their internal systems and a handful of public addresses that allow their web sites, email servers and other public-facing systems to be generally accessible. Of course, your home system can communicate over the Internet, but only because your connection goes through some kind of device that translates its IP address from an internal address to a public address as needed. If you were to log into a remote system from your home network and then run a command that shows where that remote system thinks you are coming from, you would *not* see your private IP, but the translated address that your router or cable modem provides.

It displays the routing table on your system. Think of a routing table as one that tells your system &quot;If you want to reach System X, go this way&quot;. In the routing table below, connections to any address in the 192.168.0.x or 169.254.x.x ranges are local while, if you want to reach any systems on any other address ranges, your connection requests will be sent to 192.168.0.1 and then forwarded from there. $ netstat -r Kernel IP routing table Destination Gateway Genmask Flags MSS Window irtt Iface 192.168.0.0 * 255.255.255.0 U 0 0 0 eth0 169.254.0.0 * 255.255.0.0 U 0 0 0 eth0 10.1.0.0 192.168.0.2 255.255.0.0 U 0 0 0 eth0 default 192.168.0.1 0.0.0.0 UG 0 0 0 eth0 The &quot;default&quot; entry represents what is called your &quot;default router&quot;. This address represents where your connections are sent whenever the systems you're trying to reach are 1) not on the subnet your system is attached to and 2) not on another subnet that is listed in the routing table. Another basic command that you need to know is ping. This command can help you determine if you can reach a remote system. For example, a command such as ping remhost.whatever.org might tell you whether that system is up and running. It's also useful, however, for confirming that your system is connecting properly to the local network. If you can ping a system that is across the Internet somewhere, you will know that your system is both connecting to the local network and able to reach beyond. The only problem with ping is that the lack of a response does not necessarily mean that the system you are trying to reach is down or that your network connection is hosed. The ping command or the entire protocol family of which it is a part of may be blocked before it gets to the remote system or before the response gets back to you. Another useful command that will provide you with a lot of insights into how connections are made with remote systems is traceroute. This command will display the route taken to reach the remote host and, along with the stops it makes, provide some timing information that shows how long each leg in the route is taking. This kind of information can come in handy when troubleshooting connection problems as it can show you where connections are breaking down. $ traceroute server1.abc123.com traceroute to server1.abc123.com (192.75.145.55), 30 hops max, 40 byte packets 1 pix (192.168.0.1) 0.460 ms 0.417 ms 0.392 ms 2 * * * 3 gig1-core.net.umx.org (133.164.211.33) 11.011 ms 10.986 ms 10.500 ms ... 15 server1.abc123.com (192.78.133.15) 22.824 ms 24.296 ms 23.553 ms Closing ...
